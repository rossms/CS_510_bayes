Reagan had his faults, but no one loved this country as he did. He restored optimism, laid the groundwork for the huge economic expansion we've just experienced, and pushed the Soviet Union into the gaping hole they were tinkering over. He had a strong, working policy in every aspect of presidency. We could use his clone. I would have loved for him to have had a GOP Congress with which to work.
