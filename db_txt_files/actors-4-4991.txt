as an actor, brad pitt is good. especially if you compare him with actors of his batch like keanu reeves. he plays very diverse roles and does justice to them. special mention to twelve monkeys, seven and legend of the falls. however, from the books and interviews i've read about/ with him, i do not think he is a good person at all. a little too sick for my taste
