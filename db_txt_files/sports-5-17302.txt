The Philadelphia Eagles have shown themselves consistant over the past 3 years that they have what it takes to get to the NFC championships. I hated to see Troy and Duce go but I think Kearse and Owens, Westbrook, NcNabb are a great group of players and Andy Reid has a revitalized team whose new dynamics that will undoubtably get them over the NFC hump. I see SUPERBOWL!
