Tenacious D kicks ass, as does this WONDERFUL video directed by Spike Jonze. I'm so glad that a band like Tenacious D came along to lighten up american music. This video, along with being pretty funny, is very, very well shot. Thorne was right on in calling it extrodinary. Kyle Gass and Jack Black are musical visionaries!!!! Wonderboy..won't you take me far away from the mucky muck?
