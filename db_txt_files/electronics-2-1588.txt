I owned Yamaha CLS speakers before buying a pair of Infinity RS speakers, and there really is no comparison - the Infinity speakers are much better. Granted, they also cost twice as much, but it was worth it. The Yamaha speakers had a tinny, shallow sound, while the Infinity speakers do a respectable job with bass (although not as good at bass as Bose speakers) and they are especially good at high ranges. I found the Yamahas to produce poor sound across the board.
