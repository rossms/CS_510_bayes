I don't know if many people know this but there are two different Mars bars. There is the one you get in the USA and the one that is sold just about every where else. You can get them in the USA and they come in a black wrapper with red print. This is the one you want they are excellent. Rich milk choclate on the out side with a carmel inside, they are truely decadent.
