I think the video is pretty good. The only reason I didn't give it a five is because the scenes where Mike is walking across the desert...it just looks so fake! You can really tell they just used blue-screen with those shots. Other than that, an excellent video, especially because it is one of my favorite bands, and one of my favorite guys, the very gorgeous, talented, amazing Chester Bennington, is in it. The special effects are cool. I love the parts where it is raining on the guys. I really love this vid (even though In The End isn't one of my favorite Linkin Park songs)...very well done.
