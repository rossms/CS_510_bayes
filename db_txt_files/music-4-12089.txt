when i first heard her i thought of janis joplin.she has a very unique voice and style. i think she needs to pick a style sort of like sade,leave the rock n roll part of the music out and have her instuments not over power each other.also she needs to shorten some of her songs.overall,i think she has tremendous potential.i for one will keep my ears on her music
