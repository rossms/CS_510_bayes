I started shopping at Publix when I moved to Florida from the Midwest. This is an excellent supermarket. I enjoy shopping here, great produce, meat counter, bright pleasant interior, knowlegable pharmacy, photo lab. I will pay a few cents more here for quality as opposed to saving money at some lower quality discount store.
