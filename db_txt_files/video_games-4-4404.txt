There is not much to say, just - too much expectations. Great game, but does not deserve a 5. Excellent gameplay, brilliant story, great cinematics. Poor Multiplayer servers, dated graphics. I hope that Blizzard will not start degrading their games' quality such as we've seen in this case (although it is still an excellent game). Blizzard once had only 5 stared games. They should not let that average go down!
