Philadelphia is the most liveable of America's largest cities, and Temple University is the only major research university that's state-related in the eastern part of Pennsylvania. It is a Carnegie I category university - the highest rating - and its faculty is first-rate as well. Even Freshmen can arrange to have classes with senior professors. However, the place is very large, and spread over several campuses (including campuses in Rome, Italy and Tokyo, Japan).
