A step above Spielberg and Bruckheimer, but still hamfisted and obvious. I also hated Traffic, that movie pissed me off more than any movie I've seen in the last three years, so I will never again have respect for the its director. He also is a little too fond of using filters on his lenses, to distract from the fact that his camera work is mediocre.
