Michigan is easily the most consistent football team of all time. 30 straight bowl appearances and always in the top twenty.... With a new QB brings a new exciting spirit to Michigan Football and the Defense reminds me of 97's only faster. Michigan will be ranked even higher than it's usual Top Ten finish in the years to come. I'm talkin about winning that BS Trophy within three years.
