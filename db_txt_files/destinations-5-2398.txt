Here's the thing about Istanbul: other males that I know who have been there really enjoyed the place. Women I've talked to who have been there tend to have opposite opinions... and that's largely because of the Islamic majority to the city. Women don't go out at night. However, Turkish hospitality in MY experience was incredible. One really doesn't hear enough about Istanbul in the United States to appreciate it. The Hagia Sophia and the Blue Mosque are wonders to behold. The Bazaar and the Golden Horn were amazing. My trip to Istanbul is one of the highlights of my life.
