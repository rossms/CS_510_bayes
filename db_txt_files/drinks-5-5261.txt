Nice and refreshing and it tastes great! I stops you feeling thirsty and it has really powerful bubbles. As soon as you open it up, you get that wonderful lemonade smell, and you know that sprite has saved your life once again from helping to hydrate you. The only thing It doesn't do is help you if you have been bitten by a snake! :P
