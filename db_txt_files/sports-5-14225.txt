Rice is nice ... An unbelievable iron-horse for the game. 49ers won so many because of his talents to run, break,dodge, dive and then, craddle the ball from his team mate Joe Montana. Jerry WILL go down into NFL history, as the best reciever ever, to fondle and catch a football. Yes; the 49ers had real gold in their midsts !!!
