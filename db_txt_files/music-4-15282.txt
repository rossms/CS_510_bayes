This album was a very good and if your a person that likes this kind of music you'll enjoy it. It's the kind of music that can sometimes relate to you and you feel energized and hyped after hearing it. This album is in a way played out because so many radio stations play it over and over but I guess its the listeners faults for requesting it so much.
