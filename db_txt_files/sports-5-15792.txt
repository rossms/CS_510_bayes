Adam is one of the greatest kickers to ever play the game. Inside the 40 he's around 95%. In clutch time he's 100%- two Supe victories off his foot with the time running out. Kicked a 45 yarder in a blizzard off the snow with wind swirling to send the Pats to the AFC Championship game. The guy is a simply awesome!
