All in all, The Fugitive was a strong movie. Harrison Ford and Tommy Lee Jones both perform their roles well, and the movie keeps the viewer engrossed. The movie plows forward like a train, with lots of action. However, there are some parts that are not believable, such as how a wanted fugitive would stop to help sick/injured people.
