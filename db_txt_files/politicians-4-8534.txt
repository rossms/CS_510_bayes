I really like Ronnie. I don't agree with everything he did, some of his program cuts hurt my family, but on the whole, he did alot of good. Destroyed the Soviet empire and gave the country a sense of pride in itself again. He was president during most of my time in the military, and most everyone who was serving loved him. He'll always be my commander-in-chief!
