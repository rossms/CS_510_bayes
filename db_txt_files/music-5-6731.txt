Defones are my favorite band because of the emotion Chino puts forth in his lyrics. This album is the most mellow of all three albums the band has released. The songs are not as fast and loud as usual, but they are just as great. The lyrics are so meaningful and you don't feel as much anger as usual from the band. Like always, with the Deftones, some of the songs are hard to interpret, however, they still convey all the emotions that they were trying for. I recommend this album to people of any age.
