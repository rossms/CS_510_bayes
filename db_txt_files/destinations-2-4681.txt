I honestly have never done anything in St.Louis, it is a city I've driven through dozens of times on trips to Florida from where I live in the Midwest. It was always a tradition to make sure the gas tank was full before we got to St.Louis so we did not have to stop anywhere. To be honest though, the city looks very green, very hilly, but also very old, I know it is steeped in history. It also looks very abandoned, with all commerce being evacuated to the surrounding suburbs, leaving the city itself to the poor, who do not have the means to move somewhere else.
