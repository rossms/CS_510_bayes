When I heard this album in its entirety for the first time, I was in awe. This album is a metal masterpiece. Each and every song displays all of their abilities as extremely talented musicians and passionate song writers. If you want to know why Metallica is considered the greatest heavy metal band of all time, listen to Master of Puppets, and you'll get it.
