I can't drink it , can't smell it, don't even want to look at that clear drink with a twist of lime floating at the time. I cringe just thinking about it..due to a past (unwise) decision to drink shots of Vodka chased by gin and tonics. In fact, I am experiencing a gag reflex right now as I write this..
