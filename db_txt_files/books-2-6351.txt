Well, Rush is right. But then, he's always right. I found this book to be very entertaining but selectively educating and hopelessly biased. Make no mistake, he's a very erudite, entertaining fellow, but how can anyone take him so seriously? Even he has said that he is an entertainer who happens to be a conservative. We all know Rush never went to college, but that's neither here nor there. I remain happily committed to my liberal-socialist roots while maintaining a healthy skepticism of everything that comes out of this blowhard's mouth.
