I know it would surprise many, but there is a lot more to this state than Manhattan. In fact, this is probably one of the most scenic states in the country. Lots of rolling hills and pristine lakes. The Adirondacks in the North afford great recreational opportunities like hiking and skiing. And of course, NYC is the primer urban destination in the US. Somewhat expensive though.
