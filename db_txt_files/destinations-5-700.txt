What a great city. Definitely one of the coolest cities in the Americas - up there with New York, San Francisco, Buenos Aires, and Rio - but for different reasons. DF (as it is called) is a frantic bustle of everything - from charming Coyacan to the shady Zona Rosa, to the sophisticated Condesa, to the posh Polanco - this is a city to get lost in for a while. Watch yourself though - I got drugged in a mariachi bar in Plaza Garibaldi and narrowly escaped with my wallet - but we'll save that story for another day.
