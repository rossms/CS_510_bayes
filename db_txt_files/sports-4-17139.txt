Its clear Denver is an extremely tough team to beat at home as evidenced by last night's game. Their defense is underrated and especially the secondary which seemed to confuse Tom Brady. Having said that, Denver's win last night was pretty cheap. New England had 200 more yards of offense yet turned the ball over five teams vs Denver's one. With Pittsburgh beating Indy soundly I think and would like to witness Pittsburgh thrashing a very lucky Denver team.
