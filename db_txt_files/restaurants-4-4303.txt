I've eaten at several of the outlets and found it to be a reliably good steakhouse. I suggest sticking with large hunks of beef, and try the finely cut fries and the tomato salad. It's definitely pricey, but such is the way of the world these days that a 20% increase in quality demands double the price. Service is almost always very good, but it fails from time to time; fetch the manager immediately when it's not up to snuff. At those prices, there is no excuse for poor service, and management does seem to understand that. I cannot imagine how Bob's Big Boy coould possibly outrate Ruth's Chris!
