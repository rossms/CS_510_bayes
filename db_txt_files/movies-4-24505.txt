I liked this movei it was good but not as good as the original. I was surprised to see it was barely an hour in a half but it was about Agent J who had to go get Agent K back for a mission because agent k is the only one who can help with this. So they had to deneutralize him to bring back his memory. I thought that Frank was so funny in this movie and I liked that he was in this one more that the first movie but the first men in black is still better.
