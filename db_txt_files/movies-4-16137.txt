Very good movie...Minnie Driver and David Duchovany are the main characters. Usually I don't like them but the were great in this movie. It starts off sad, and sort of drags at first. But it gets much better as the movie continues. It is about a husbanda and wife. The wife dies and donates her heart to a woman (Driver) who needs a transplant. Turns out that ex-husband and Driver meet and fall in love.
