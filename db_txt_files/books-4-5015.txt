While this book looks at some important themes and how they relate to one another (specifically the blurring of good and evil and Christianity and myth), it is just not all that well written and isn't all that interesting to read in my opinion. I believe that this book is considered so important simply because it's one of the (or perhaps the) oldest book in Brit Lit.
