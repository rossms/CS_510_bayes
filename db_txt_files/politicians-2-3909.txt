Dear Mr. Bush: I am a registered Republican, and have been for thirty three years. I do not want Al Gore to be our next President. After watching your first debate, I am worried. Please try to limit such comments as fuzzy math . As a concerned American I am really getting tired of personal comments. Stick to the issues. You have a very strong appealing presence, but in my opinion I believe staying away from anything personal would serve you better. The majority of Americans know the character of the current administration is the lowest of low, so don't get down on their level. Thank you, Sandy
