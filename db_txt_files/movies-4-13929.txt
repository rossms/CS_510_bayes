 I want the truth. YOU CAN'T HANDLE THE TRUTH! . The truth is, this is a pretty entertaining movie. It's hard to go wrong with talented actors such as Tom Cruise, Jack Nicholson, and Demi Moore, a government conspiracy plot, and some memorable lines. Definitely a Hollywood formula movie, but a Hollywood formula movie which was well executed.
