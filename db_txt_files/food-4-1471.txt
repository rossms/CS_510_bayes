Oh God, they are heaven. I had to stop eating them for 3 years while I had my braces but now I can have as many as I desire (as long as I don't get a toothache). The only downside is that if you eat too many with too little time apart, your mouth gets all filled with a sickenly sweet taste and it can easily turn into a very harsh taste. Not something to strive for. Otherwise they're great. I don't really know which one's the best, I like them all. But there's something about the mintchocolate ones...
