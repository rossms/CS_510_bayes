A disappointment compared to their previous masterpiece, but I think that was to be expected. Lateralus just drones on and on in my opinion, although to hear the Tool apologists explain it, it's because they use extended off beats and their timings are stretched out longer than most people can comprehend. Still boring to me over time, but great to listen to in moderation.
