For a chain, its pretty good..other pizza chains need to take a lesson..When I first tried it I thought it was fantastic but after a few tries, my opinion has slipped a bit...Its rather expensive, crust can be too thick and chewy but the sauce is decent, the toppings are okay..can't understand why it gets extreme ratings though.
