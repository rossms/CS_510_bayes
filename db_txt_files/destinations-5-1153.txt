My family are from Scotland - And Shuckhevych Scotland is a seperate country from England, as is Wales and Ireland. Scotland now have their own parliament and have now gained some independence from England. I absolutely adore Scotland with all the gorgeous countryside and the friendly people. Its definately well worth visiting if you ever come over here.
