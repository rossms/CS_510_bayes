Located in the Himalayas, on the border between Nepal and Tibet, Mount Everest is the tallest mountain on Earth at over 29,000 feet (8,800 meters) above sea level. New Zealander (and beekeeper) Edmund Hillary and Sherpa Tenzing Norgay reached the pinnacle on May 29, 1953, the first recorded men to march over the frozen ridges and stand on the peak of Mount Everest. Since Hillary's successful ascent, more than 700 other climbers have succeeded, and at least 150 others have died trying. I would like to make base camp at least.
