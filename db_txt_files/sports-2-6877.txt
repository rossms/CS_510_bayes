I have to think that Danny Ainge's credibility will be severely tested with the resignation of Jim O'Brien. Ainge derailed a team that was on top of their division and winners of 5 in a row when he traded away their heart and soul, Eric Williams, and several key contributors for the talented Ricky Davis and unproven Chris Mihm. So far the deal has not worked out. The departure of O'Brien signals that at least one bright basketball mind that is intimately familiar with Boston's personnel does NOT think that Ainge is taking the team in the right direction.
