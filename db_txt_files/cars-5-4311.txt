My dad has a Quest and he loves it. I have 5 other brothers and sisters which makes vans a necessity. He carpools every morning and afternoon, takes trips to the garbage dump and moved two kids to college with his Quest. He loves it. He can't talk enough about Nissan. He used to have a little king cab Nissan pick up truck that never had any problems with. To this day he says that was the best car he has ever had. The van is the same way. He hasn't had any problems.
