The Fionavar Tapestry is a wonderful trilogy. I'm just re-reading it, having read it a number of times already. To me, it is one of only a few fantasy books that succeeds in drawing me into its world, leaving everyday life behind for a time. Drawing the Arthurian legend into its story line was a brilliant step, enriching the Fionavar history with the inclusion of its separate unfolding. Definitely worth reading, as are Guy Gavriel Kay's other books.
