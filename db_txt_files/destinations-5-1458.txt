Ive been in the south west and its beautiful, i stayed in a small town called Biscarosse about 10km outside Bordeaux on a studen t exchange about 10 years ago. The people were actually really nice, beautiful forests a nice lake and the food was good even though I was a complaining teenager. I could live there.
