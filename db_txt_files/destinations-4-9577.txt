Hyde Park was a beautiful place to visit. The green grass, I have never seen so many gorgeous flowers in bloom! When visiting London, depending on the time of year Hyde Park is a nice clean, quiet place to realx and reflect on your trip or people watch. Speaker's Corner is also an unusual thing so see. Overall I liked it better than Central Park and that is hard to top.
