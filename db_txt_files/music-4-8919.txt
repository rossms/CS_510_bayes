I didn't really connect with this song until I saw the video...I have no idea why. Now when the song comes on the radio I don't change the channel but sing along. I think it's because the lead singer looks like he's in pain during the video...it makes you identify with his pain that the witchy girl has inflicted on him. Speaking of the girl in the video...she is so ugly, bless her heart. She looks like a human chihuahua. I especially like the part in the video where they are hugging but he pushes her away...serves her right! Witch!
