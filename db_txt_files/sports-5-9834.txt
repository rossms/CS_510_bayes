Best team in the league behind Portland. I am not a Lakers fan, but they have been absolutely dominating this year. Shaq is unstoppable - Kobe has been playing more under control - and the Lakers team defense has been solid. The only team that poses any threat to LA is Portland and San Antonio - and San Antonio if falling fast.
