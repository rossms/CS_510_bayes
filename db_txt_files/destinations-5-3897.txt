I think that Pittsburgh is living proof that the horrible term of rust belt must die! Most if not all of the cities in the so called rust belt have improved dramaticaly since the 70's when the term was invented. I have only been thru there a few times, but the people were very nice, and the city seemed very clean. I liked how historic it was. One think i didnt get, what is up with all of these little sub-cities in pittsburgh? They are sort of part of pittsburgh, but they have different names like, Squirrel Hill. If those are all suburbs of pittsburgh, where is the actual city itself?
