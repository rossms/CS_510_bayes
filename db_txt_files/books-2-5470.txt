Although some parts were funny and good, the overall impression I got from the novel was terrible. It was poorly written, and usually the protagonist of the story should not be despised by the readers. Even in the play 'Macbeth', I actually still liked the villain despite all his actions. This is one of the worst novels I have ever read.
