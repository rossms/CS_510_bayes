I own a 2001 RAV4 L, in Natural White with fender flares and alloy wheels. I really enjoy driving it, and the versatility of the seating/cargo area is impressive. Since it's based on the Celica platform, it really does feel like a sports car with ground clearance. The full-time 4-wheel drive is great, too. The RAV has great traction in any weather, and no steering torque like most front-drive vehicles.
