Absurd movie in every light. Perfect example as why John Woo has made a poor transition from Hong Kong genre films to American action movies. His exceptions lie in the over-the-top exceptions of the Hong Kong genre, yet does not appreciate American taste and the lack of extensive, drawn out conclusion (i.e. 20 minute finale of Face/Off).
