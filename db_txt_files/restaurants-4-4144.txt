The one near me gets all the details right. Impressive service, food and atmosphere. P.F. Chang's doesn't feel anything like a traditional Asian restaurant -- the vibe is more hip, upscale and bohemian, and less mom and pop. I was surprised to find no Asians working there on my last visit, just a sprinkling of Asian patrons. P.F. Chang's has plenty of devotees (especially those on special diets) and here the wait was so long on weekend nights that they just moved to a reservation system. For those that like contemporary Asian prepared well, its worth a visit.
