Absolutely the greatest book of fiction written to date. Superior charecters, a magnificently created and crafted world combined with the prototypical battle between good and evil. I have read and reread this series and love to go back and visit my old friends. This is a fantasy book that you don't need to be a fantasy fan to enjoy.
