When I first heard this album I was totally throwm by her voice. Very raspy, almost like Eartha Kitt. My girlfriend loved the album so I was forced to listen to it a lot. I eventually got into the arrangement and realized the whole band has a lot of talent and is bringing back older sounds and making them new again.
