When I first saw the commercials for this pizza, I was immediately interesting. I have always hated frozen pizza, but the catchphrase It's not delivery, it's Di Giorno really appealed to me. So I decided to try it out, and boy, what a pizza! Unlike most other brands of frozen pizza, this actually tastes like a pizza that isn't manufactured in a factory. I'll even go so far as to say it actually tastes like REAL PIZZA!
