I own a 1998 villager and it has been great until the other day when it developed valve lifter noise. This noise is to the point it must be repaired. Sounds like a common complaint. I thought the engine was supposed to be indestructable in these cars. That is why I picked it over the other vans. I have pampered the car with frequent oil changes and no towing. I am not covered by an extended warranty so if you buy one of these vans make sure you have some sort of extended warranty that covers major repairs of the engine.
