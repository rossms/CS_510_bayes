While the pregrated packaged form is terrible as it has oxidsed smells off like vomit and tastes terrible, freshly grated it is excellent in soup or pasta. Regiano has the highest grading followed by Padano, but the Regiano you buy in Italy is of second grading of the same quality as the Padano they export (So try it at home not in Italy).
