This regular guy - played by Jamie Foxx - is just doing his thing, supporting himself by driving a cab, with his true dream in mind of running a fancy limousine company. Trying to be a good guy, when Tom Cruise the psychopath killer comes into his cab and basically owns him and the cab for the entire movie. The love interest, Jada Pinkett, is sexy as always. The movie turns as predicted, with Jamie Foxx being the hero, and Tom Cruise gets what's coming to him. No surprises but some decent action and great, fabulous overhead views of the LA streets.
