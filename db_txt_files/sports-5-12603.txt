Notre Dame is Football, that simple. Regardless of the recent troubles (Notre Dame struggled in the early 60's, too). NFL would not exist if it weren't for Notre Dame. College Football would not exist if it weren't for Notre Dame. You can hate Notre Dame, but if you love Football you have to respect Notre Dame. p.s. Notre Dame has 8 national championships in the modern era, after 1936. Notre Dame has 11 total and 19 seasons that they where considered national champions in a respected pole. You can hate the Irish, but let the facts speak for themselves. I hate the Yankees but I respect them as a team.
