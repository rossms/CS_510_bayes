I drove 2WD LX and was impressed, handled well and was quite comfortable. Highway Safety 40MPH crash test winner, 5 year 50,000 miles waranty, good looks, good price makes this a winner!! Was not as happy with the 4WD, a bit slugglish for me. Drove a Toyota RAV4 and was unimpressed. Looks like a box with wheels!!
