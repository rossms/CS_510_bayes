I am a Cubs fan. I just thought I would get that out of the way. Albert Pujols is going to go down as the best 1st baseman EVER. 30+ homeruns in each of his first 5 seasons!!! Holy Crap. 100+ RBI in each one as well. Getting better as a defensive prescense. Best 1st baseman in Cardinals history, Mcguire doesn't even deserve recognition for that achievement. Good luck to the Cardinals in these '05 playoffs. Represent our Central division proudly and kick some ass.
