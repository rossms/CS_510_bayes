I went there for college and it was one of most unique places in the world. Few colleges comes even close to the natural beauty. The student population is large and you get large classes in your freshman and sophomore years but it's the same at any large research institution. Class sizes shrink tremendously in your junior and senior year. Cornell is not known for grade inflation and there are a lot of smarties (but dumbasses who help pull the curve down do exist, thankfully). Food on campus is better than the local restaurants. I'm a graduate student at Yale now and I am happy I went to Cornell over Yale.
