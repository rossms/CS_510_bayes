THE COLONEL WOULD ROLL IN COFFIN IF HE SAW WHAT KFC HAS DONE TO HIS CHICKEN. WHAT HAPPENED TO 12 HERBS AND SPICES? I WOULD GUESS THERE ARE ONLY 3 OR 4 IF THAT. DID THEY CUT BACK TO LINE SHARE HOLDERS POCKETS? WITH CHURCHES BEING THE WORST(BLANDEST) KFC IS A CLOSE RUNNER UP. X-TRA CRISPY DOES NOT EQUAL MORE FLAVOR ONLY MORE FRIER OIL ABSORBING POWER. SO PLEASE, FOR THE COLONEL'S SAKE AND FOR THOSE WHO CRAVE GOOD FRIED CHICKEN, PLEASE BRING BACK THE ORIGINAL RECIPE. ONE STAR FOR THE NEW WRAPS AND ONE FOR THE CUTE CASHIER IN LAS VEGAS-SHE HAD ME AT HELLO
