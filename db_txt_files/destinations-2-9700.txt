I only buy these when they're 2-for-1. I normally smoke Turkish Golds, and for my money it doesn't get any better than that. 27's always left me with a nasty aftertaste, and many of my friends who like secondhand smoke have told me it is the worst smelling cigarette ever, I agree, always leaves my clothes smelling completely disgusting...Go for Turkish Golds or Kamel Red Lights...
