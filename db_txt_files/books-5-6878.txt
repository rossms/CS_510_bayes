Second best fantasy series ever, behind only goodkinds' sword of truth series. Very Dark and sadistic. This is the most unpredictable series I've ever read and I read alot. The only given in the series is that atleast one main character will die at the end of each book, but you won't know who. This is a very emotional book, from heart broken to giddiness. The characters are totally captivating, you will love and hate them as if they were real.
