A very pretty and modern airport - one of the most recent built. There are lots of shops and restaurants, and several bookstores. The train system that goes to each concourse is confusing. The biggest knock against DIA, though, is probably how ridiculously far from downtown Denver it is. When you land, all you can see in every direction is corn and wheat fields. The city is miles and miles away, about a $40 taxi ride.
