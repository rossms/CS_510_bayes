good graphics, a very fun and interesting game. I had issues with the controlls as i am not used to the camera angles, as i am not a veteran of the MGS series. but, with persistance i overcame this and found a very enjoyable game. PS. the only way to play this game is on the extreme difficulty setting or else it becomes tediously easy to avoid and kill gaurds.
