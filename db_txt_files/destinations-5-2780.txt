Montreal is a really amazing city - a short plane ride away, and yet you'll feel on some streets like you're in Paris. Everyone speaks English as well as French, so there are no worries as to language barriers. The mountain park just outside town is stunning, the museums are spectacular, and there's great food. The underground city is one of the most fascinating structures around. Montreal is a really well kept secret.
