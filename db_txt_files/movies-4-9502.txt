You would never want your small kids anywhere near this movie, but I found it to be very funny indeed. Sometimes tastelessness can equal funny, and sometimes it doesn't, but in this case it works. Of course the movie is about those lovable South Park kids who watch a lot of tv and let themselves be almost completely controlled by what they see. That could have been a risky venture considering it is a tv show, but I don't think the producers were the least bit concerned.
