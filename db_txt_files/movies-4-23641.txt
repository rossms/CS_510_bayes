Didn't expect that big dance scene which was basically a massive orgy only without the actual penetration being seen. How come the people outside of the matrix know when the enemy will shoot but they can't track that Smith guy even when he's right behind them? They also can't tell that Smith did something to that one guy which lead to his betrayal. I hope they bother to explain Neo's little trick with the sentinels in the end.
