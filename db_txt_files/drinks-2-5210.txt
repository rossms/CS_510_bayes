I never got into the whole orange soda kick. I'd rather have real orange juice that doesn't make me feel like I want to choke when I drink it. Plus the calories in Orange Crush are a lot more than other types of soft drinks. I believe a 12 oz can is close to 200 calories, whereas Coke is closer to 150.
