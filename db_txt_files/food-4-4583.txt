As a child, Monterey Jack was my absolute favorite cheese..I guess because it was mild and soft..not overpowering at all..now it is still good, but not my favorite. It is a little boring..but seems to please everyone. Monterey Jack is a sure thing, can't really go wrong with it, but it isn't too exciting.
