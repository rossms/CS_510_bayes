I have owned three Aleros, a 99, an 01 and a 2004. There was a reason I bought 2nd and 3rd ones. It was simply the most car for the money to be found anywhere. Period. It has all the equipment I could want, handles ans stops well, is comfortable on trips and has adequate power to pass and the only xtra (and it wasn't necessary) was a sun and sound system on the 2004.
