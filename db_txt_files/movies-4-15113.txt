I found this film to be appreciably funny. Actually, it is one of the smartest comedies I have seen in a long time. I was impressed with Michael Douglas' character as a somewhat frustrated college professor and writer, who just couldn't seem to stop writing, and I was equally impressed by Tobey Maquire's role. While I admire Robert Downey Jr.'s acting, I find him somewhat detestable as a person, and I am glad he didn't have a larger role.This movie is definitely worth a rent. While some might find the mild drug use in the film offensive, it is done with such gest that most will find it funny.
