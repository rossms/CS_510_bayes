I love them. They're probably my favorite cigarettes. I like the natural stuff. Less additives as well, another bonus. Sure they take forever to smoke, that's what good about them. If I want to kill time, I'll smoke an American Spirit, it'll last a while. You shouldn't smoke them when you go on a quickie break from work, they burn too slowly and you won't enjoy them-you'll be too worried about getting in trouble for taking too long of a break.
