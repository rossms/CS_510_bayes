I hate Illinois. East St. Louis isnt as dumpy as some say from the interstate, St. Louis, Missouri is far worse. However, Chicago is very boring for the very large city. To many industrial sites, to close to Downtown Chicago. The buses look old, unreliable and unsafe. Effingham is likely the nicest city in Illinois.
