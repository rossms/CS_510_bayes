We love our Avalanche! It has the room we need to haul two small kids on long trips to visit grandparents, and the comfort to be able to ride for 500 miles and not get out all stiff and sore. The storage is remarkable and it drives like a dream. I highly recommend an Avalanche to families on the go. This is the BEST vehicle we have ever owned.
