There is nothing graceful about The Big Unit but he really gets the job done. The sight of him on the mound brings fear to many a rookies heart, and Randy fears no one. He brings new meaning to the words brush-back pitch . Love him or hate him, you have to admire his skill. One of the strangest images in baseball history is the film of Randy pitching this season, and the bird flies in front of a 90+ mph fastball. Just an explosion of feathers and the bird never knew what hit him.
