Rooster is by far the best blend of dip. Not only does it taste good, but it also feels good in your lip. I don't understand why so many people choose Skoal over Rooster. I have dipped Skoal on numerous occassions just because nobody has a variety of dip in Chicago. I didn't like dipping Skoal then, and I will refuse to dip it today. Someone please explain to me why Skoal is considered better than Rooster.
