The Mexican style Red Baron Pizza is good stuff. One of my favorite frozen Pizza's. The quality is great considering the price. I went to the store they had a sale going , a really good sale, Red Baron pizza for $1.89 ya that is right $1.89 for a 16-18 oz pizza. In my home town I can always find it on sale, alot of the time I can get them for under $3.00 how can a person go wrong?
