Marino rules!!! All these people think its soooo horrible that he never won the Super Bowl. Big deal. He owns basically every major passing record and led the Dolphins for years. Now c'mon people isnt that enough. I'm a big Dolphins fan but let's face it he had no help it was all him. He has to be the greatest quarterback of all time and is a shoe-in for the Hall of Fame.
