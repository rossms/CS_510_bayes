WOW! What an AWESOME Machine. I just purchased a 2005 black one and took it to the Ocala National Forest last weekend. This is by far the best 4-wheeler ever made. The acceleration will amaze you. It's like a rocket on 4 wheels and it's incredible braking system will stop you almost immediately. If your thinking about getting one, I would highly recommend the Honda 450R.
