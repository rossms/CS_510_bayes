 James and the Giant Peach is a masterpiece. It combines magic, mystery, and fantasy with solid character development and an excellent plot, making it extremely appealing to children and adults alike. Typical of Roald Dahl, the story is empowering to children, and there are many incredibly creative and entertaining characters, including two bizarre aunts and an array of talking arthropods. This is a great read-aloud book for kids in grades one through three, and kids in fourth grade and up can read it on their own. Highly recommended.
