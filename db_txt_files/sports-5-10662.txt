For many diehard Golden Bear football fans, if he does give Cal its ninth win, he would be considered a redeemer. Should he give them an undefeated season and an nat'l championship, he will be a saint to them. He is one coach that can act like OSU's Jim Tressel of 2002. No, I do not think that he will go to another school or to a pro team for a LONG while.
