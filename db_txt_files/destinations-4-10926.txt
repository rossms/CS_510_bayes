I'd give it 4.5 if I could. Prices are a bit high, but all amusement parks are, am I right? The Son Of Beast is excellent, as long as you're under 6'1, and I'm 6'3. Ouch. Skip the Racer, unless you go on it just for it's nostalgia. Also, if you rode the Flight Of Fear and was given a headache from the bars, try it again (they removed them.)
