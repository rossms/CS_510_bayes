A great broswer, it is highly customizable and quite secure..you can make it even more secure by downloading the no script extension. The only problem is after upgrades some extensions dont work and you have to re download ones for the new version (some auto upgrade) but thats a small price to pay for the security over IE, maybe the next IE will fix it's security flaws..
