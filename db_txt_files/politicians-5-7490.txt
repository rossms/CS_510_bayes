Jesse is my kind of Southern politician: he isn't mealy-mouthed or ambiguous when he identifies the categories of human beings he hates - pro-choice feminists, gays/lesbians, pointy-headed liberals, and so forth. He spells out his biases and prejudices in capital letters, and has never claimed that he was quoted out of context when questioned about even the most objectionable views. Except for possibly Senator Santorum, Helms is almost the last of a dying breed of populist-demagogue politician.
