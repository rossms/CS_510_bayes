It's just like its website says: The first time you buy may be just for the bottle! Looking through the bottle is like peering into a church and seeing a stained glass window--spiritual spirits? But then I thought, after I'd purchased a bottle, Beautiful bottle--lousy vodka. Not so--I was totally and very pleasantly surprised. I found Krolewska to be a delightful vodka--exceptionally smoooth. Addendum: How ironic! Three relatively obscure vodkas (Citadelle, Effen and Krolewska), that I had rated with 5 stars, all received a 3-star rating without comment in one day's time.
