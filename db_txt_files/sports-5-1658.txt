I love the White Sox, but it's risky to make an emotional investment in this team. Red Sox and Cubs fans like to whine about their long championship droughts but at least they have beautiful stadiums that people want to go to. Instead our owner decided to replace a historic neighborhood stadium with a bland suburban ballpark and it's been all downhill since. How many generations of Sox fans will live their entire lives without experiencing a World Series victory?
