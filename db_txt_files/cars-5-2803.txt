Okay, this is the first actual SPORTS car that I've owned, before that it was mainly SUVs... I took a race driving course last spring, with my Rex, it was my first time really driving that car It turned out that it rained for the whole 2 days of the lessons, I was sure I was gonna loose it, being a 255hp twin turbo real-wheel drive car. Well, I pushed it really hard, no one could keep up with me(there was a Porsche Carrera and an Honda S2000) I was ahead of everyone. That's when I new this car there was a true sports car, and it was still stock then :p
