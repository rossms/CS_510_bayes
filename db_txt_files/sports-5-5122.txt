It's 2003 and the NBA has to go over seas to find guys who can hit a jump shot. These guys don't play defense and can't spell weight room. I love Grant Hill, but how can he be ranked #6 when his own college coach has said Len Bias and Jordan are the best the ACC has ever seen? Don't hate because of the way he died, Bias was the best. If he had not died Mr. Jordan would have no more than 3 rings!
