An excellent story with a most unusual premise. This would have rated 5 stars except for my prejudice against vampire novels. (Which I admit, so you may take my review in stride) However, the idea of interviewing a vampire, and getting the vampire's side of things was brilliant, and to the best of my knowledge, unknown. I STRONGLY recommend this book, if you haven't read it.
