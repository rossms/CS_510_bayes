This is one delicious candy bar. The chocolate is of reasonable quality and they made the caramel nice and smooth and creamy. I wouldn't want to eat them very often, because then other chocolate bars would taste terrible in comparison. It's like once you catch a glimpse of paradise, everywhere else is just not impressive anymore, not even Colorado. So they will have to put up with being a once-in-awhile kind of treat for me. I try to be fair to all my candy bars.
