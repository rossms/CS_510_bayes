Midway through the current 2003 pro football season, it appears that many need to reevaluate the coaching talents of John Fox (who is currently ranked #24 on this list). The Carolina Panthers have to be considered one of the surprise stories of the season despite substantial weaknesses at the quarterback position. So far, Coach Fox has built a winner around the defense, special teams, and the running game. Three overtime victories and several close wins all attest that the current success starts at the top.
