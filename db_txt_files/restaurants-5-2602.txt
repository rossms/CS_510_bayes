The best fries in the universe!!!!!!!!-their small burgers are good and I used to enjoy a 1/4 lber without cheese now and then but haven't had one for awhile. I don't know what took them so long to put breast meat in the nuggets instead of that entrails stuff-they're (i.e.,the nuggest) still not that good tho which suprises me(?).
