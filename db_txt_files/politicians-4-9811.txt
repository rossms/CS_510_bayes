Though I was not a huge fan, I think history will be kinder to GHWB. He led the anti-Iraq with an unprecedented degree of worldwide support, to a complete victory. Emerging w/ a 90%+ approval rating, he sadly did nothing with all of that political capital. Unbelievably, he capitulated to the Democrats, going back on his promise. Anyone ever hear of an economic theory that suggests that the remedy for an economy hovering on the brink of recession, is to RAISE TAXES???
