Even though this Tequila is supposed to be 100% Blue Agave it isn't nearly as good as the tequila from the 'factories' near Jalisco Mexico. For Tequila it's five stars, but for 100 blue agave nice stuff it's only three stars so I give it a 4****. Oh yeah for the morons out there that get alcohol poisoning. Dont mix drugs and alcohol... Yes, weed is a drug... And lastly, 15+ shots is too much of any hard liquor, so dont rate something badly because of your incapacity to control yourself. Leave drinking to mature people.
