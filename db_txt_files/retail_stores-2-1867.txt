I think almost every Wal-Mart I've been to has been pretty well kept and organized. I've never had a terribly rude employee encounter. I'm giving them a 3 however because I hate all department stores. I hate lines, and big parking lots, and monstrous buildings with enormous blue signs hanging in front. If I have a choice I'll pick up whatever I need from someone local. The only reason I'm not giving them a 1 is that I have on several occasions gotten just what I needed there and at a good price. Unfortunately, in my opinion that's does not a good store make.
