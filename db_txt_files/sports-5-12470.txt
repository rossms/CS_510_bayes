Miami WON the National Championship. It was blatantly obvious that the referre threw the flag AFTER the receiver missed the ball. That was a great defensive play and a BAD break for the CANES. Don't get me wrong, Ohio State played like hell, but Miami could have blown them out if it wasn't a game of inches. GO CANES! By the way, Dorsey is getting a bad break in the preliminary draft, he is a DAMN GOOD quarterback.
