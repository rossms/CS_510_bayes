I've only spent a few hours here and I've only been to the downtown riverfront area, so I'm rating it based on that experience. Jacksonville's downtown area seems more exciting than most other southern cities I been to. The riverfront makes for a picturesque scene, especially at night. The business district is right on the St. John's river and is clean and modern. Jacksonville Landing offers food and shopping.
