I have to say that I didn't expect that much violence. But, I think Samuel Jackson is such a great actor. He's able to get carry himself as Shaft so well that it makes this movie fun to watch. Also, it keeps in the line with the good cops and the bad cops. So if you are ready to see a lot of violence, then you are ready to see shaft.
