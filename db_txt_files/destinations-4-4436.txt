Spent a week there - an interesting area to explore for a few days. Northern Lights, caribou stew, outstanding fishing, hunting and hiking. The "Strange" Range, Jose Loco's Bar & Grill and the Vietnamese Noodle House are just some of the interesting attractions. But I'd say the distance is not worth travelling to come here unless you're Japanese (and desperate to see the Northern Lights), have friends who can show you around, or plan to spend the summer (in which case you'll meet a load of unique people).
