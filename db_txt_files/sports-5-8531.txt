Ok well first i'd like to say that kobe is just like mike clutch player and a great athelete. Hes also got the best all around game in the NBA he's got it all a shot,passing,dribbling,jumping,speed, and a basketball IQ. And second look how good he did when shaq was out ya the didn't win that much but look and t-macs magic the have the worst record i the nba. And I can see why people dont like him as much because that girl said she got raped but she just want to sew and be rich. Just two words not guilty. Keep hitting those game winners kobe!!!
