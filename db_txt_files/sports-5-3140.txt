Hit for power, hit for runs, stealing bases, play defense, great arm, great attitude, speed, and always in position. What other player can claim all these skills? Ruth? Please! Williams? Tremendous hitter, good arm, no speed, average defense. I could go through this all day...there is no one to match all of Mays' abilities. Willie all the way!
