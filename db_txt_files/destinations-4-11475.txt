I went to school at the University of Arizona. I grew up in Northern California and have enjoyed the outdoors since I was little. I was used to pine trees, oak trees and redwoods and I was in shock when I first went to the desert. I kind of freaked out but it didn't take long to find beautiful trails and camping in the Sonoran Desert. In my four years in AZ I camped and hiked in the Sonoran Desert a lot and I sometimes even miss the different kind of beauty the desert holds. The spring time is the best time to go because the desert is in bloom and it is beautiful.
