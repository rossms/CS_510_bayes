A great recruiter but poor graduation rates and has trouble beating coaches like Ferentz and Paterno who has less talent. Team get by with close wins but with the talent they have should be blowing teams. He won a Title in 2002 but on a bad call. The Clarett NCAA violation case should have put his Program on Probation.
