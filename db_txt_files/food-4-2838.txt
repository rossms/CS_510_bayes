Like most of the country I grew up with this soup. It didn't make as big an impression on me as it apparently did Andy Warhol, but I still have a few kinds that I like. Speaking of Andy, the tomato soup is pretty tasty as is the Bean and Bacon. I also prefer using their Cream of Mushroom when I make one of my own comfort foods - souped up rice. Other selections (like their vegetable and the chicken and noodle) are really pretty bland and unappealing.
