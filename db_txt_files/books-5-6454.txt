This was a great series to read. Once I picked up each book, I literally spent the next few days just reading. Gabaldon has done a fantastic job of developing her characters. They seem almost human, so you can't help caring about them and what happens to them through out the story. Strong characters and an interesting plot, make for a very good read.
