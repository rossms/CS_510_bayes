Does ANYONE know how to read the code on the bottom of the can?-when was it made, what do the letters and numbers indicate? MY opinion of Grizzly: The BEST alternative to Copenhagen. Less than half the price of Cope. Buy a 5-can roll and give it a fair trial and you'll agree! GRIZZLY is from the makers of Kodiak and Levi Garrett.
