What a disappointment. After seeing how many awards that Forever War had won and hearing descriptions like Haldeman has written THE seminal SF classic, I had high expectations. What I found was an extremely dated book, whose characters were never able to make me care about them. While the parallels to the Vietnam war were mildly interesting, this book never really came together for me. If you are looking for a quick, simple read, you can do worse than The Forever War - if you are looking for something with substance, you should look elsewhere.
