I've seen two of Moore's movies and while he does bring up some interesting points in SOME things, he takes TOO MANY things out of context. Moore plays on Americans willingness to believe what is set before them. Heaven forbid some may actually do their own research and root out the truth in all of Moore's half-truths. Go online and type in THE 59 DECEITS OF FARENHEIT 9/11. It will shed some light on some of the facts that Moore reveals in his film. Also, try watching Celsius 41:11 or Farenhype 9/11. Both give differing views than Moore. GOD bless you all, America, and George W. Bush.
