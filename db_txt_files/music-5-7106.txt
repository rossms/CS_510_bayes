Just as a video: it was a really interesting concept, especially for that time period, and again, for that time period, it was pulled of extremely well; the mixture of animation and real life was very fluid. This is probably not the absolute best music video, or maybe not even in the top 100, but it's still really innovative and well done considering that it was done when the concept of the music videos was still in its infancy.
