Coming from a small school in Gonzaga, who would've thought that this 6'2 point guard would become one of the best players of all-time. He scored when he had to, but that wasn't what he came here for. He passed first and if necessary, shot last. He and Malone were the best pick-and-roll duo of all-time.
