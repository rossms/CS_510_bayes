I never cared about Ole Miss one way or the other until a year ago when some friends took me to see a football game. I found Oxford to be a really nice town and the college campus is a beautiful place. The people also seemed real nice. Best of all, Eli Manning was playing that day and was so impressive that I've been a big fan of the Rebels ever since. They're one of my top 3 favorite college teams.
