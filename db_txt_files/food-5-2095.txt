It has been so long since I last ate a candy bar but just seeing this list makes my mouth water with fond memories of being younger and being able to eat a candy bar with no guilt at all. I used to really love these sweet chocolate covered peanut butter cups. They are just the perfect combo. The peanut butter is a great consistancy that matches the equally good chocolate that surrounds it. Don't forget the glass of milk to help you wash it down.
