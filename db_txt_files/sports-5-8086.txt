IVERSON IS THE BEST PLAYER IN THE NBA. HE HAS AMAZING GAME AND IS LOADED WITH SKILLS. THE MAN CAN'T BE BEAT BY NO ONE, AND IS TOTALLY UNMATCHABLE. HE HAS THE SHOT, SPEED, AND OVERALL GAME TO PROVE IT. IF HE DOES GET TRADED, I WILL NO LONGER BE A 76ER FAN; SINCE HE WAS THE ONLY REASON I LIKED THE TEAM IN THE FIRST PLACE.ONE DAY MY MAN IVERSON WILL BE THE MVP, AND WILL GET THE RESPECT HE DESERVES FROM EVERYONE IN THE NBA. AND PLEASE DON'T TALK ABOUT HIS HAIR AND TATTOOS BECAUSE THAT'S WHO HE IS. PLUS I THINK HE IS SWEET LOOKING AND SEXY. MUCH LOVE IVERSON,MY BABY. FROM IVERSON #1 FAN EVER.
