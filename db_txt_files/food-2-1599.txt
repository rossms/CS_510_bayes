Unenjoyable candies. The sour apple simply assaults the senses. It probably tastes like the poison apple Snow White bit into. All the flavors are so sour that your face feels like it is going to peel off. 4 out of 5 dentists love Jolly Ranchers because they literally weld themselves onto your teeth, thus increasing their business. You need a pick-axe to get it off. In general, everytime I eat a Jolly rancher, I always end up regretting I did so.
