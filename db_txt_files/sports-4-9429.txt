Much has been made of Mutumbo's defense, but simply because he blocks/alters many shots. His post defense positioning is not very good, and he gets by on size and athleticism alone many times. On offense, he could be much more dominating. He fails to seal the defender in the post, relying on his size instead of positioning. One thing I do like is his free throw shooting. You rarely see an NBA big man who consistently hits free throws, but Dikembe does.
