The freest city in the world. Buy marijuana in the coffee shops, and magic mushrooms in the smart shops. See a live sex show or rent a hooker in the Red Light District. Old world architecture, but very well lit streets. I found the people amazingly friendly, much more so than in big American cities, though you'll find a handful of people on the street trying to sell hard drugs. Just say no thanks and they'll go away. Extremely beautiful city with its many museums, parks, and canals. Everyone speaks excellent English.
