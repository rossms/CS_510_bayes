I first read this in high school, and I have re-read it every few years since. Tolkien uses the ancient myths of Europe with brilliant deftness, in the process creating a new mythology. The division of the book into a trilogy, which was caused by publishing limitations at the time, has resulted in every fantasy writer since trying to turn 200,000 words into 600,000.
