Very talented actor with notable range, although he did usually a roster of similar roles. Shone early on in Anatomy of a Murder and The Hustler, and showed comedic talent in Dr. Strangelove. Also did a very fine job in Patton, did well in lessor flicks like The Hospital. His work in the TV series East Side/West Side was also topknotch. I saw him in a Circle in the Square production of Death of a Salesman: around 1976 (also featuring Teresa Wright, James Farrintino and Martin Scheen) and his performance was truly compelling, inspired, intense.
