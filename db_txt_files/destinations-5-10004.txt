marlboro menthols were sort of strong at first but as i got used to them.. they were the best menthol cigarettes i ever had.. marlboro menthol lights are not as strong but give you the same satisfaction. i used to smoke newports and after smoking these i kissed them things goodbye. sometimes the menthol lights have buy one get one free deals and it is all good. if you are a true menthol smoker then these are the cigarettes for you.
