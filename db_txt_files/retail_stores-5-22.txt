I'm a huge fan of Barnes and Nobles particularly their online service. In New York their books are delivered no charge next day- sometimes sameday! As for their stores their variety is huge, the help is customer friendly and I love occasionally getting away and just sitting around and enjoying a Frapachino in their conjoined Starbucks.
