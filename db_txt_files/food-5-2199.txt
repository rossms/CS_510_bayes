Kit Kats and Kit Kat Big Kats are one of my favorite candy bars. I'm a chocolate and wafer fanatic and having these two combined puts me in heaven. It has the right amount of crispiness and sweet milk chocolate. The original Kit Kats taste slightly different than the Kit Kat Big Kats, but each are delicious. If you haven't tried one, you've been missing out!
