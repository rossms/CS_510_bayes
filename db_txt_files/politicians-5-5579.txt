I thought the GOP learned from 1992, 1996 and the 2000 NY senate race NEVER to underestimate a Clinton. I'm glad to see that they haven't learned their lesson - in 2008, her political skills and nationwide popularity will bring her to victory. Their isn't a GOP'er out there (except Sen. McCain and Mayor Giuliani, who are too liberal to get the GOP nomination) who has what it takes in character, skills or experience to beat her.
