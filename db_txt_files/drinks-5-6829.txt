We go on an annual golf trip to Arizona with the guys. They introduced me to Don Julio Anejo. We have compared other tequillas on the comparison list and they don't even come close. Anyone who thinks you need salt and lemon to enjoy tequilla really needs to try this stuff. I recently received a bottle of the good stuff Anejo for Christmas. I'll continue to try other brands but Don Julio is my proven choice. I tried another variety of Don Julio may have been silver but it was not nearly as good. Anejo is the one.
