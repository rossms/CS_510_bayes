Of course, after such a good first game, could the English company, Bullfrog, pull off another classic? Well almost but not quite. Naturally it had a graphical face lift and there were a few more extras like the Casino Room where your creatures could win the jackpot and dance to Disco Inferno (possibly one of the weirdest things I have ever come across in a computer game) But they had taken away some of the all important control and tried to tidy the interface up a bit - as they say, if it aint broke, don't fix it.
