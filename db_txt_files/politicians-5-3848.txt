It is a sad day in America when the inventor of the internet(hahahahahaha) and Vice President of the United States,Al Gore, gets a site on the internet shut down when he and Ralph Nadar conspire to rig the election by manipulating the votes. From what I understand the states where Gore needed votes you would vote for him and where Bush needed votes they would vote for Nadar. I would like more information on this if possible but I am pretty sure it is true since it was on the news and the site was shut down...Shame on you Gore is that the example you want for your 1yr old grandson?
