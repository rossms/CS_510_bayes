Not sure if we're supposed to be rating the player (outstanding) or the human being (disgusting). I don't know how Ravens fans can sleep at night cheering for this guy or having their kids wear jerseys with his name and number on it. Even if he didn't do it, he know who killed two people. And the companies that use him as an endorser are equally disgusting.
