This one turned out pretty good, mainly because of the onscreen charisma of Kate Hudson and Matthew McConaughey. There were some genuinely funny moments, supplied mostly by Hudson during the times she was trying to get him to dump her. The ending was entirely predictable, but it has enough charm to make it worthwhile to see one time. I watched a relative's copy, and I wouldn't recommend going and shelling out 20 bucks for the DVD.
