England's best monarch ever. She is someone I really wish I could meet. She triumphed over incredible adversity, and she was ruled by her head, and not her heart. UPDATE: She did not really want to execute Mary Queen of Scots;she agonized over it. But while Mary Queen of Scots is an intriguing and romantic figure, she was also plotting against Elizabeth I, so in fact Elizabeth had no real choice.
