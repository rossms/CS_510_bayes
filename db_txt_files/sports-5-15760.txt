Kearse is a remarkable athlete. His speed, his reach, and his balance are enough to give QB's nightmares. Right now, he's more of a pass rusher than a run defender. He's very quick off the snap, he has an excellent first step, gets to the QB in a hurry. He just can't get to the point of attack on runs.
