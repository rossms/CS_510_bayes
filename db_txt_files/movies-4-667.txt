This is a movie in two parts. The first, bootcamp, is ingenious. It is fresh, exciting, and painful to watch (because of the content). The second half, out at war, is just like every other war movie. It blends together with Platoon, Apocalyse Now, Saving Private Ryan, etc. Not bad, but not terribly memorable. Overall, a good movie though.
