Yes, JB, he was definately a child actor. Though I think his original dream was to be a professional baseball player, Kurt Russell ended up starring in several films - many for Disney - before the age of 21. One of the few who successfully moved from child to adult roles. I know him best as my younger sister's biggest heart-throb.
