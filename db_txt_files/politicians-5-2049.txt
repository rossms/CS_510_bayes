jim doyle took over our state during hard times. he has had to make tough decisions in order to bring our economy and our state back up to the level it used to be. these decisions aren't always popular, but they are working, and although the republicans in the legislature absolutely refuse to work with him, i have faith that wisconsin is in the right track. and don't forget, doyle unseated the republican tommy thompson left us for a reason.
