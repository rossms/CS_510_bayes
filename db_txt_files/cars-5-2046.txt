The C5 Corvette has brought GM into the 21st century performance wise. Outstanding performance in every category- great handling and acceleration, with the perfect mix of superb road feel and smooth, comfortable ride. The finish and quality of these machines is simply outstanding. The styling of these cars is almost unbeatable. Anyone who bashes the C5 Corvette obviously has no idea what they are talking about. This car accomplishes for $40,000 what other cars accomplish for $80,000. An excellent value and an excellent car.
