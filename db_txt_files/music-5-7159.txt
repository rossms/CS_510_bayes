The video was the most compelling thing i have ever seen. Who really cares if it's low budget or not. That's what makes it what it is. This video will remind people how different these people are; how it changed the whole music scene as well as a new music genre. The entire song is filled with kurts thoughts and emotions that no one else can describe but only by listening. When you saw that video, heard his words, his music, you knew that it would be something different; something that will knock you off your feet. ...peace, love, empathy
