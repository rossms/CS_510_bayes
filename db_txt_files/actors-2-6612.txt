He's a mediocre actor. He can play just a role: the twit. Yet I admit he's good at playing twits, I'm sorry he couldn't be cast in Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets , he would have been great as Professor Gilderoy Lockhart. That character is a complete chicked head. Anyway, his best film was An Awfully Big Adventure , at least he tried to play a different character and he almost succeeded. Hold on, Hugh, you might make it one day!
