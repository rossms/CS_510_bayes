I have never had a problem with Best Buy. Their salespeople don't work on commission so they often will recommend a better product, even if it costs less. Also, they have all kinds of no-interest financing deals on their credit card. They have a lot of open box items that you can get the regular warranty on, so you're getting a product much cheaper, but you still have a good warranty. I highly recommend Best Buy. Any problems I had were fixed quickly.
