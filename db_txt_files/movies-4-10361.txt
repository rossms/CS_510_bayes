an almost 4. It has humerous moments in this movie. Adam Sandler is sent to an anger management theapy, because he was accused of a bad temper. Which is silly since he was the opposite and was quite passive. he is assigned to Jack Nicholson who does everything he can to upset him. It turns out what he really needed was a assertiveness training to stand up for himself which he does learn { sorry for the spoiler} not great has a couple funny scenes.
