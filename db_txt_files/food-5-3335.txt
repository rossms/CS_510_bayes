Probably the best frozen Pizza I've had, the crust is very good. The price is salty, when I think of Frozen Pizza, I don't think of it costing me more than $5 , but hey that is just me, if I consider spending more than $5, I will go get one from a Pizza shop somewhere. I can get a damn tasty Pizza in my town for $5 it is a carry out special and it is better than Freschetta all day and cheaper. Just using simple logic.
