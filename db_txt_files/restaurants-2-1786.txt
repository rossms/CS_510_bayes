How does a place that only uses seven or so ingredents for there entire menu stay so popular. Everything taste the same so save the cash and get the cheaper stuff. If you dont eat the food for awhile youll notice that even the drinks taste like a Taco Bell Taco. I usually just eat the rice & cheese its pretty hard to mess up since Taco Bell employees seem to always make mistakes. Ill only eat Taco Bell if everywhere else is closed.
