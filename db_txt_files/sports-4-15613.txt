Hey Magellan, let's not get the bust ready in Canton for this guy just yet. I agree that McNabb is the only offensive weapon that the Eagles have. But, not too long ago, there was another fleet-footed and strong-armed Eagle QB with very average receivers and no running game. He had a very strong Eagle career, but was basically run out of town at the end. Down the road, McNabb could be great, but at this point he is a good player who needs to improve if he wants to take his team to the Super Bowl.
