The desert moutains and scenery around Las Vegas is cool, as is Hoover Dam. Lake Tahoe is magnificent especially when you approach it from Carson City climbing up the mountains and at the summit the lake ringed by snowcapped peaks come into view. Breathtaking indeed. Aside from these attributes Nevada is a weird and ugly state. Just a lot of emptiness and dirt. Every sinlge town and city there is lives and breaths on gambling. Basically their economy is based upon ripping people off. Not cool.
