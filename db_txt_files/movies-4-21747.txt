Watched this with a group of friends of mine and we all did really enjoy it. The effects were absolutely stunning (as per usual) and the battle sequences were executed beautifully. My only critism of this film was the 'cheese factor' - it did feel far too cheesy in places and ruined the feel of the film. Apart from that, this is a must-see film. Outstanding.
