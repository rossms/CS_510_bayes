The video game equivalent of heroin. I couldn't stop playing it and eventually had to cut up my game CDs. The gameplay is incredibly mindless, and the people you run across while playing it online seem to have a mean I.Q. in the single digits, but it's dangerously addicting. You'll probably get plenty of gameplay out of it for your money, but you'll also be ashamed that you waste so much time with it. I know that's how I felt.
