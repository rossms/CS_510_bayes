Tasters Choice instant has unnaturally-big and round and beige crystals which resemble rabbit 'droppings.' The taste isn't much better: Very freeze-dried and cheap with a motley combination of flavors. Not much of an aroma and very little caffeine 'high.' At least the coffee isn't too bitter and, thus, doesn't require very much sugar. As far as instant goes, I steer away from this one and opt for Folgers-Classic and Nescafe-French Roast.
