I don't much care for Roman Polanski, but some of his films just cannot be denied. This film has an excellent story, and comes from a time when horror films were made without special effects, concentrating entirely on story. Take it or leave it. It's good. If I'm getting ready to go to bed, and it comes on, I'll watch it. I am completely intrigued by the film, and its excellent characters. I don't much care for Mia Farrow though. I find her to be obnoxious in most of her films.
