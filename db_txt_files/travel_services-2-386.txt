I am a top tier frequent flyer on US Airways and I stoped flying withthem after several bad experiences. I got tired of hearing the excuses of the new reservations system. The final one was when my flight was cancelled over 12 hours before my flight and I was never notified. I wasted a whole day in airports. Despite complaints, their customer service really has provided me nothing.
