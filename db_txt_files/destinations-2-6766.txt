Coming from California, my opinion may be spoiled, so just keep that in mind. I have lived near Rapid City for about a year now, and I must say I am not impressed in the least. It doesn't really have that small town feel (ie, the people are still pushy and rude) yet doesn't have nearly enough stuff for it to be classifed as anything other than a small city (seems like there's only one of everything). It does get crowded here during the weekend because people from Wyo and Neb come here to shop. This is the only decent size city for 300 miles or so. The only redemming quality is the Black Hills.
