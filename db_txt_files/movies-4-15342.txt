Overall, a pretty good movie. The story lines were generally entertaining, and there was far more comedy than I was expecting. It has been awhile since I've seen a movie in the theaters where the whole audience was laughing loudly, and the Terminal had them laughing quite regularly. The worst part of the entire movie had to have been the contrived relationship between Hanks and Zeta-Jones. It was unnecessary, and not very believable, if you ask me. Despite this, though, it was a good movie overall, and safe to take most of the family to.
