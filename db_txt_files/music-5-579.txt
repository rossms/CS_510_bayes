Best band of the 80's? A strong aruguement can be made for U2. What does that say about a CD that is a collectoin of all of their hits from that decade? It must be a pretty great album. This CD contains most of the band's singles from the 80's ranging from 'Sunday Bloody Sunday' to 'In the Name of Love'. This is a must-have for everyone's record collection, even if they are not avid fans of the band. Will there be a 'Best of U2, 19990-2000'? - Undoubtedly. Will it be as good as this alnum? - Unlikely.
