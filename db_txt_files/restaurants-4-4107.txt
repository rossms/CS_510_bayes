I would give it a 5 except for the loud music. I love the peanuts, my steak (usually the ribeye) and baked potato are consistently wonderful. I like this place better than Outback. The only drawback, how loud the music is. I hate missing half the coversation at the table (I'm in my 30's, and my hearing tests at 1.2, which is almost unheard of (pardon the pun)) and I have a hard time hearing what people are saying because of the noise. I think the food is great; however, the music level is way too much! Wouldn't recommend for a large group who likes to talk.
