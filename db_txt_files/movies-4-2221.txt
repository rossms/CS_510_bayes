Between the music and the acting, this film can honestly be considered, at least in modern times, as a classic symbol of America's pop culture. I thought that all parties involved gave wonderful performances in this film. The music was great too! It's not what I would consider a great movie, but it was very popular in its day and I enjoy watching it from time to time.
