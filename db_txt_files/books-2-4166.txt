I really take a beating for this one- but Catcher is very overrated. Holden is a loser who doesn't fit and takes it out on the world. Yes, the world is unfair. . .yes, the world judges you by appearance. . .give me a break. Holden should have done something, anything, except whine. A novel about some twerp who isn't tough enough to hack it in the world? (YAWN!) My nerdy Literature-friends always give me a verbal beat down for this one. The wife also gets defensive.
