I enjoyed this movie mainly cause the music is so great. Catherine Zeta-Jones was great and it shows that she has done singing before. (She had a hit or two in her counrty years ago). Renee Zelwegger on the other hand ruined the movie for me. I don't think she was talented enough and I saw enough of her bones. Queen Latifah was perfect though. Its a good movie.
