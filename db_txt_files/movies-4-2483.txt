Twister is good because the plot combines action and the character's emotions. It is very suspenseful because the audience does not know if the Dorothy equipment will work. It is also interesting to watch as a relationship slowly starts to crumble between Bill and Melissa as the relationship between Bill and Jo heats up. The movie also has comedy, with the characters Dusty and Meg.
