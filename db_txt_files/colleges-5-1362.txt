DePaul does not accept anyone who applies! Take it from someone who made admissions decisions. There is a process in place. We review each application individually. Many apply, some are admitted and some are denied admission. Unless you are on an admissions committe, you cannot say DePaul accepts everyone. If this were true, we would need more campuses! DePaul is a great university which provides a valuable education.
