i just got my 350, and absolutely love it. i weigh 145 and it has plenty of power and im am very glad that i didnt go with a honda or even the raptor 700. unless your drag racing its pointless to have a 700. besides it only takes a jet kit and an air system to put the 350 where the honda 450 is at. and you save about two grand. the 350 is a great all around bike that can take you any where you want to go and have plenty of fun doing it. like i said eaarlier its pointless to have a 700 unless your drag racing up a dune or racing on a street. 350 is perfect
