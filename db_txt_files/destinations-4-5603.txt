Seeing that I live in Virginia, I'd say it is a wonderful place to live AND visit. Imagine it... beaches, mountains, big cities, small towns, nature and great shopping all in one state!!! Not to mention that you are never too far away from the nation's capital, Washington D.C. Last, but certainly not least, there is a fine array of choices for higher education.
