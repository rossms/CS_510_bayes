I really think I enjoy Cap'n Crunch more as an eat-alone snack rather than a breakfast cereal in milk. I definitely like the crunch. But it does taste a little waxy (perhaps something off the plastic box lining sticks to the cereal?). And, just when I take a bite that I think is soggy enough, a maverick Crunch will go and scrape the roof of my mouth something awful. That takes away from it. But overall, it does taste pretty good and, for me, isn't too sickeningly sweet.
