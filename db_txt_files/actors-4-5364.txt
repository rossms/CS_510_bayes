Dennis Quaid has a bundle of talent, and if given the right leading role, can make a big name for himself in Hollywood. He's never really given a bad performance in my opinion. Frequency was one of my favorite movies, and I thought he gave a great performance in that film. Wyatt Earp , The Rookie and Any Given Sunday were all good performances from this talented actor. I can't wait to see how he pulls off his role as Sam Houston in the upcoming film, Alamo . In the final analysis, Dennis Quaid has a unique talent, that if put in the right film as a leading man, can climb the tallest mountains.
