It's Oh God meets Ace Ventura meets It's a Wonderful Life !!! Which, I'm sure is exactly how it was pitched. Don't go in with high expectations or expecting anything that hasn't been done before but, a movie that will hold your interest and make you laugh. Although I will say Yankee haters will not be happy with God's choice of headgear. Suffice to say, it explains a lot.
