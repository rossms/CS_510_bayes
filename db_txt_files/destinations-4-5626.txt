Not my favorite state, but not that bad eiter. Boston is nice, but has become so high-tech and business related, that its middle class can't live there any more, thats sad because they are the people that used to give boston it's nice charecter. And yes, beach hit it on the head, Mass. gets a bad rap from the far right for being too liberal and unamerian and all that other crap. Let's not forget, it was the SEAT of the American Revolution. And whatever state that all of the haters live in, WOULN'T exist without it.
