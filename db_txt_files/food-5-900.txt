The sweet styrofoam is surprisingly pleasant. I always found it a little mysteroius how the bag holding the cereal was not like other cereal bags. (I think Pops may also do the same thing, but I don't like that cereal enough to know.) Be warned that eating too many of these will give your urine a distinct smell that you can only recognize if you do eat too many.
