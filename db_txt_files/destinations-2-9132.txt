Hong Kong is an interesting city. If you thought america was capatalistic, you will certainly change your mind after visiting HK. A simple walk around the city will have you bombarded with street salesmen trying to push watches and suits. The city is disguistingly polluted and on rainy days the smell is overwhelming. It is far too overpopulated and it is overstretching its capacity. It does have a wide variety of public parks and a beautiful skyline (on days when you can see through the smog) and the subway system is top notch. I wouldn't recommend visiting here unless you absolutely had to.
