I give Bacardi 151 a full five stars, becuase it is a fine drink! It is not only affordable, but it can allow more then one person to have an enjoyable time. I take it by the shot, followed by a chaser of Coca-Cola. The taste and/or warmth is insignificant, becuase I immediately follow each shot with a healthy amount of chaser. Also, I have found that utilizing a chaser makes it hit a person's stomach much less harshly than if a chaser was bypassed. By drink of choice if I am paying!
