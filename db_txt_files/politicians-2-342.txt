As a person, views on Edward VIII vary greatly. Some saw him as courageous and brave for refusing to reject the women he loved for a crown and title. Others see him as a man whose sole interest in life was sex and women & that he did a diservice to his country by abdicating. As a monarch...well, he did only serve 11 months that really only managed to give tabloid journalists a few good stories.
