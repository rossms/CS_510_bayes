NIN! NIN! Whoa. They are so great. I have been listening to THE FRAGILE for about oh 5 months now and I promise its a slammin cd. You feel just as trent reznor did when he wrote the lyrics as he shouts them or barely whispers them into the mic. My favorite songs inclue starf****** inc, the void, and fragile.
