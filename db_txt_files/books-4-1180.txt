Reading Calvin and Hobbes makes me wish I were a kid again, to do all the fun stuff that kids get to do. I love their mischief! Next winter, I DEFINATELY want to make snowmen Calvin-style (like the one with the snowman laying on the ground with a ice cream scoop stuck in his back, that was great!) in my front yard.
