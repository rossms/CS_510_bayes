I used to drink Wink by Canada Dry at my grandfathers house in the 70's and 80's, then they stopped making it. Several imitation grapefruit flavored sodas have come along, and of them I think that Squirt is the best today. It does include Esther of Wood Rosin (YUM!) and brominated vegetable oil (for that cloudy grapefruit juice look). If it didn't affect the flavor, I'd like to see those ingredients dropped in favor of a more pure formula. Still, it is a wonderfully refreshing beverage - especially after drinking some sodas that are heavier on the syrup.
