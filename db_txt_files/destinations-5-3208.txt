My favorite city in CA. The whole place feels so laid-back and fun, more like a really big resort than a city. There's a beach area for any mood, from Pacific Beach (which to me seems livelier than any beach in L.A.), to the more gorgeous and sedate La Jolla and Coronado. And while it's not exactly the most urban city, San Diego has a great downtown - the Gaslamp District has perfected the restaurant as nightlife destination and outdoor seating concepts and can only get better with Petco Park opening next door. In short, SD is the ideal getaway. I need to get down there more often...
