I can't give five stars to a 2 or 3 tool position player. That makes no sense at all. How can such a specialized player be ranked number 2 all-time. He was also a mind-numbingly selfish player. He was fine with losing if he went 4-4 & didn't give a crap when the team won if he had the misfortune of going hitless. He was the Frank Thomas of his, albeit a MUCH greater hitter.
