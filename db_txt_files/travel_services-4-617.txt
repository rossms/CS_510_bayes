Everything that magellan says about this airport is what I would say about it including that it is my least favorite place. The airport itself is relatively easy to get around, but in some cases it can take an eternity to go fom one flight from one terminal to another. Nevertheless, it has somewhat good archetecture and most of the flights are on time.
