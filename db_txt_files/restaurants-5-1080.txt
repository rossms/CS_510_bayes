Next to Dairy Queen, this place is still my all time favorite. Not only is it All AMERICAN food and fun, but the stores are usually super clean, and the food is downright delicious. A little greasy, but so what? It is burgers and hot dogs..duh ! I recommend A@W to everyone. Especially their root beer and root beer floats. Thanks. 'Kolby
