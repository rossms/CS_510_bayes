The guys of EA took football to a whole new level when they made Madden 2000. Regular and arcade options offer two different modes of play as well as the ability to manage a team, play in a famous game (i.e. superbowl), or even practice and create your own plays! Different camera angels help to bring the game to your TV but annoying annoucers comment (can be turned off) and the release of 2001 make the game less appealing.
