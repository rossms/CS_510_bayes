Has the Milk Duds recipe been updated? I remember Milk Duds as waxy, tasteless, hard nuggets with the capability of removing fillings. The other day, however, I had some Milk Duds at the movies, and I changed my opinion. They tasted fresh, chewy, and pretty darn good. The chocolate coating wasn't nearly as waxy as I remembered it. Considering that they're relatively low in fat and taste good, I'll probably buy them again.
