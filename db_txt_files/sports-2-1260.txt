Crap. I forgot how to spell overrated. I think it is O.V.E.R.R.A.T.E.D. Yeah, I am pretty sure that is how you spell it. Look it up in the dictionary and you will see a picture of a cave-man... oops, make that Johnny Damon. If he was with the Pirates or the Devil Rays do you think he would get the same credit???? No???... I didn't think so... OVERRATED!!!
