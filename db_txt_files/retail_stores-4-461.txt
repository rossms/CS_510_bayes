Although the Gap is not really my style of clothing, everytime I go in there the sales people are very friendly and attentive. I can usually find something I like, and there's always someone around to let me into a fitting room or run and get me another size. If you're shopping for a gift they usually have pretty good suggestions. I'd say the Gap is pretty on top of things!
