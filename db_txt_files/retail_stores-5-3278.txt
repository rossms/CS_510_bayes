Although the movie rentals are slightly overpriced, their selection is great. Also, their new video game plan ($20 a month for unlimited game rentals) and their new buy-back-after-rent plan (rent a DVD, get it pre-played for $9.99 later down the line) are bringing up the business. They also have a great previously-viewed/played collection, hardware rentals, blank tapes that are reasonably priced and yummy snacks, all in one store.
