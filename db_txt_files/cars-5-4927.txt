Took delivery of a 2001 Dakota Quad Cab with the 4.7 Liter V-8, Automatic, 3.92 rear end (2WD) and all the stuff. The truck feels vey solid and has power to burn. Ample room for 4 people, cozy for 5 with leather bucket seats. Fuel economy about 17 MPG in mixed driving but is improving as the truck breaks in. Comfortable, no rattles. All round great truck. My first domestic vehicle in 35 yrs.
