I believe it was at Hershey Park that I survived the Super Dooper Looper. I have a large button the size of my head to prove it. This is a great amusement park, fun rides, very clean park and courteous personel. If that isn't enough, the heavenly scent of chocolate is wafting through the air and the tour of the factory is fun and interesting.
