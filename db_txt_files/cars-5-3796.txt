It really is a great truck. We had one for a year and then traded it in on a Suburban. It was the most comfortable truck I have ever driven. We put Mickey Thompson's on ours and very nice rims. It looks a lot better when you do that. Spend the extra money to put nice wheels and tires on it. I do LOVE the looks of the new Avalanche. Thinking about trading the Suburban in now.
