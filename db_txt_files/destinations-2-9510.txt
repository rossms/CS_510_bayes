okay, so here's the story I'm born in Sweden, a couple of countries away from England but what do they teach me on my history lessons yes that's right all about the tower of London and so there I am finally in London after three years and there's the tower herad so much about standing there not looking greater okey maybe bigger than any of the old faboulaus houses in my own hometown- such a turndown!
