Marcus Camby is one the greatest player to set foot on a basketball court(college NBA)...Even though injuries have plagued him recently hating GM's; Camby led UMASS to one of there most successful seasons did the same for the NYKnicks... You see that neither team has proven to survive without him. Give him his props and quit hatin'!
