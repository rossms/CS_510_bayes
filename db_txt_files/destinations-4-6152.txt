Kentucky is a pretty cool state. The scenery is pretty nice, and the people are smarter than people make them out to be. I used to be the person that would cross the bridge in Cincinnati, and see the Kentucky sign, and wonder why it would say Where Education Pays on it. They truly aren't as dumb as people think. This state does have hicks, but if you think about it, every state has hicks. Anyways, the Kentucky Derby, Mammoth Cave, and the Cumberland Gap are always great places to visit.
