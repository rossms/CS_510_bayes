I like the point that NoSuchSol made, and he supported his comment very well. However who would not want to be seen rolling down the road in a Lamborghini Diablo, and who don't point at this car and gaze in awe. This car symbolizes a true sports car and to think that someone wouldn't want one is insane. Yes their are nice looking cars out there that are more affordable, but the Lamborghini Diablo represents luxury, wealth, and speed. Its too bad that the average person can't afford to own one.
