He's a very good coach, but the expectations make him seem worse than he is. He's maintained Kentucky at a high level , which is an accomplishment in itself. They expect more of course, but Tubby delivers what you'd want from a top coach. He won a National Championship and gets top players and produces pro players. UK needs to go to a Final Four more often with him though. It's all there to do so, and Tubby must produce, but if you look at what he gives you at the end of the year, you have to say he's a great coach.
