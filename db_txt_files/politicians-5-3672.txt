We finally have a president who will think of our country before himself. It is a wonderful feeling knowing he will do what is best for most of us rather than individual groups who think they are important. We are all important and I know George W. Bush knows and respects that. To all of you who think you deserve more than others, you are the problem. We are in this together, black, white, does not matter, we all need to live and work together. I know in my heart and soul we have a chance now, only if we use it.
