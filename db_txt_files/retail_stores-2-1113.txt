Personally, I don't shop there. The only thing I've ever bought there was a sticker I slapped on a guitar. Don't really have anything against the store, really. But I've got to admit... the concept of punks and rebels shopping at the mall is a bit incongruent. Especially since the store prices there aren't exactly cheap. Besides the fact that dressing like every other goth or punk is far from rebellious, people usually look goofy when they're dressed head to toe in Hot Topic gear. But hey... to each their own, I guess.
