I'm not really a fan of either Ethan Hawke or Uma Thurman, but they both do a good job in this twist on Huxley's classic book Brave New World. The movie raises some interesting, important issues in an entertaining, if predictable, way. Given that each day scientists are making huge strides in genetic engineering, the concept of pre-natal manipulation of the mental and physical characteristics of our children is becoming a reality, and we're going to have to figure out how to deal with it. If you like Gattaca, do yourself a favor and read Brave New World. Huxley's visionary book was far ahead of its time.
