As was the case with Robert Byrd I am glad to see that there are people willing to forgive Senator Dodd for his alcohol / sexual indiscretion because it took place over two decades ago. In order to avoid the label of hypocrite the only conclusion one can reach is that these same people are also willing to forgive and forget George Bush's indiscretions with alcohol because, like Senator Dodd, they took place over two decades ago. I'm overwhelmed with the forgiving spirit which has been gracing the pages of RIA recently.
