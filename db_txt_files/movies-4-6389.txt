This movie has stood the test of time because it is fascinating. Though the special effects seem outdated, notice how they hold our attention. In some ways the special effects are still stunning. A remake was done in the 70s and it flopped. Why? Because it just wasn't the same. Scenes in the original, such as Kong reaching into the window to grab the lady out of her room are.... unrealistic? More like unforgettable. This is just a great movie!
