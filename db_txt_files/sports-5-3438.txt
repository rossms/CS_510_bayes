Mike Schmidt is the greatest 3rd baseman of all time. People remember him for his homeruns (and, I guess, over 500 of them will do that), but Schmidt also was a tremendous fielder and won multiple gold gloves in the National League. He was also a winner leading the Phillies to the World Series title in 1980 and the playoffs many other times in the 70s. Unfortunately, like every other athlete in Philly (other than Doctor J), he was booed at different times of his career. Schmidt deserved better.
