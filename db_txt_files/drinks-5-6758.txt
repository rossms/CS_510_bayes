I used to steer clear of Starbucks, because I thought that, being a vegan, my only choice would be black coffee. Then I went there last Saturday and discovered they can replace the milk in all of their beverages with Silk soymilk! O revelations! I got a soymilk Vanilla Latte. It was delicious. Thumbs up from me.
