A fun place to visit, and I suspect a pretty neat place to live. Massachusetts offers a lot in a small package: big city life and slow-paced towns, mountains and beaches, old and new. I'm particularly fond of the Cape and Islands area. Martha's Vineyard is a fantastic place to spend a long summer weekend (if you don't mind dodging a little traffic), with its quaint villages, romantic beaches, and scenic bike paths. I always have a good time when I visit Massachusetts.
