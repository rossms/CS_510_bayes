Very definitely one of the most cerebrally rewarding SF novels around. Its a study in dystopias...so ignore it if you're looking for Captains Courageous in Space fare. A little weak, or at least vague on the hard-sf front, the book is more aboutthe sociological speculations - and isn't sociology a science, too? However, her other well-known novel Left Hand of Darkness is definitely stronger, which is why this only recieved 4 stars.
