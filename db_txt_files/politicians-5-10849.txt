I like McCain, he is not afraid to criticize others of even his own party. Don't think he'll ever been a really high standing offical (ie Presidental Candidate) in the Republican Party, he isn't Republican enough, for them anyway. Anyway, when he comes close to being the part candidate, some idiot spreads rumors about him having an illegitimate child in the South, that idiot runs the world know. But, he has two things in common with Kerry, they both served well in Vietnam, and they both have rich annoying wifes.
