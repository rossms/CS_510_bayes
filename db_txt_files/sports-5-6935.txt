By far the greatest basketball player. He was called a ball hog led the league in assists leads the league in rebounds. NO ONE will ever reach that mark. It has been said that he didn't play against anyone so that's why he could score and grab all the rebounds..... How much social pressure do you think an extremely gifted BLACK athlete could have done during that era without social concerns????
