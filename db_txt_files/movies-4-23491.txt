A fan of the 1953 film directed by Bryon Haskin- I awaited this remake with great anticipation. I enjoyed this film very much- it had a dark and gritty photography style which was melancholy and creepy at the same time. Cruise did a good job- even though I am not a fan of his- and his recent comments have diminished my opinions of him further. Nonetheless the film is chilling and entertaining.
