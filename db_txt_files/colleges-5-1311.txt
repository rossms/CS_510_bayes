It is a great university with very good centers of excellence. If you are gearing towards a career in law, medicine, engineering and business you are looking at the right place. It is literally rich in financial resources, so if it does not have it (a particular professor, equipment, etc.) it will get it. It also helps that it has the best college basketball program in the world.
