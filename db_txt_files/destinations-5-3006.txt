One of my favorite cities. Live in Seattle but drive to Vancouver often. By far the most cosmopolitan city in the pacific northwest and the most beautiful. Vibrant, clean, pedestrian friendly downtown with some of finest collection of stores in North America. Excellent restaurants, world renowed Vancouver International Jazz Festival is a must, absolute breathtaking natural beauty, great parks. By far my favorite city in the pacific northwest and one of my all time favorite.
