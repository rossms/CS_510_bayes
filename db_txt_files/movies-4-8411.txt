This movie was hilarious. It got a bit sappy at the end, but the rest of the movie more than made up for it. When Moses was having fun with the Einstein doll and little Jack said his first word I was laughing so hard I got the hiccups. Hoffman and Streisand were great. They looked so cute together. Especially when his face was covered in all that whipped cream.
