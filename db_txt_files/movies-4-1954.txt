 Come out come out wharaver ewe are! I still crack up thinking about De Niro's delivery of that line. This was an uneven, but respectable remake of the classic. Still, as adept as De Niro is at projecting a psychotic predator, he couldn't touch the realism Mitchum gave this role in the original. I guess there's no harm in trying to reinterpret or improve something, but it never seems to make much difference when it was done so exceptionally well in the first place.
