The box I got recently had a fake- vanilla and more sugary taste (ugh!) whereas up to a few months ago, they didn't. I prefer the lower fat version because the wafers are crisper and not so sweet and fake-vanilla tasting. Are the manufacturers making cheap substitutions for the good vanilla flavoring?
