This is a coach rating, right? Not a personality test. Bobby is old school for sure, been around forever. I'm sure if you looked at all the others on the list real close with the media's help for close 35 years, you'd find some things you don't like about them. Bobby Knight has over 800 wins, and 3 National Titles. He is a 5 star coach.
