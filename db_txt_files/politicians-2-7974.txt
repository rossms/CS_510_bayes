I believe FDR to be a moderate to overrated president. Many historians like to think he was the most influential president ever, and he was! However, teh question of whether he was influential in a *good* way or a *bad* way is up to you. . . I thought it was very chicken-like to find something else to help him out of his own handicaps. If he hadn't been able to declare war, he never would've gotten the U.S. out of Depression! And no, Eleanor was *not* lesbian :)
