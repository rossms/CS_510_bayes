How can you not like a movie that helped to launch the Full Moon king, Charles Band? Although this movie was released by Vestron, Band took the rights to the movie, which he produced, and launched Full Moon which released the rest of the series. The acting is a little sub-par except for Matheson, who stars as Jack Deth, trancer killer/private eye.
