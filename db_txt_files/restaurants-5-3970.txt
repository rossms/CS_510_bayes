Cheesecake Factory is awesome! I love the CF's in Atlanta, Orlando and Charlotte. I recommend the lettuce wraps as either an entree or appetizer, they are really wonderful. Also the Thai Chicken Pasta is wonderful if you like spicy food. As for the cheesecakes I have had several different flavors and they all have been delicious. But my favorite is the Dulce de Leche. The Cheesecake Factory is a great dining experience. Great food, good service and a beautiful dining atmosphere.
