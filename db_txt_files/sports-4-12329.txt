Being a Michigan fan, i get to see an Ohio State team in Ann Arbor every other year. And i must say, they're a pretty good football team. Dont get me wrong, they're the enemy. But i have a tremendous amount of respect for the program, unlike Michigan State. Year in and year out they keep the rivalry alive. that in itself is worth recognition.
