 Cast Away is definitely worth seeing for several reasons. The most obvious is that Tom Hanks is absolutely phenomenal as a FedEx employee who is stranded on a deserted island for four years. His performance is believable, and he does a great job showing his physical and emotional transformation over the course of his ordeal. There are some really exciting scenes, too, like the plane crash at the beginning of the movie. I thought the plot was pretty good, and I liked the ending (unlike many RateItAll raters) because it was realistic. If you haven't seen Cast Away, I definitely recommend renting it.
