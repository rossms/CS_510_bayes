Eek I love these cookies, however fattening they may be. The buttery, oily shortbread cookie tastes sweet and comfortingly familiar, and the thin fudge stripes are what make these guys addictive. I remember eating an entire bag of mini Keebler Fudge Stripes cookies on a vacation (we went to the grocery store there to stock up on snacks because the hotel food had such jacked up prices). These taste good refrigerated a little before eating, or else the fudge might melt and you'll have a gooey, brown mess instead of cutely designed cookies.
