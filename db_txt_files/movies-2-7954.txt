Must have seemed like a good idea on paper. Turned into yet another case of an interesting premise that just could not gain enough strength to support itself on film. False start made it seem interesting just long enough to create equally false hope it would render SOMETHING a laugh, an emotion, something mildly metaphysical. But, alas, it falls flat in the end with the repetition of days taking on all the charm of Jinx the cat chasing Pixie and Dixie past that same mouse hole, chair, table and lamp combination for the 30th time. You just stop caring what it was all supposed to mean after awhile.
