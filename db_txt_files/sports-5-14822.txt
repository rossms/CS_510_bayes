Favre is one of those guys with the oh so rare trait that even if you hate the packers, you still have to love number 4. He doesn't complain, or showboat, just does his job, and when he gets in the zone, forget it. Very few pro players, aka michael jordon have the ability to take over a game single handedly, and Favre is one of those guys. He is amazing to watch, he has got that extra "quality" that can't be measured. Thats why other players have so much respect for number "4". Just an overall incredible player, best player I have ever seen play...bar none! I have seen quite a few!!!
