Real Chinese food (the stuff you eat in China) sucks bigtime. After 3 weeks in the wilderness I visited the one in Beijing. It was like dying and going to heaven. I had the ribs with Jack Daniel sauce. One of the great moments of my life. I don't visit Friday's very often except in foreign cities. Then it is a must stop.
