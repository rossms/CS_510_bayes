Sure I'm Irish. But if there is any objectivity in me it says that Guiness is the Lord of all Beers. Not only every Stout, but every beer looks up to Guiness. So in a way, its not even a beer, unless you call it St. Beer or St. Guiness. All beer should strive to be as good as guiness is. Bass and Newcastle come in next on my list.
