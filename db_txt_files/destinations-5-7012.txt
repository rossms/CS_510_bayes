Certainly deserves to be on top of this list as a CITY tourist destination. Very good public transport, relatively safe, with the very best of historical, artistic and cultural attractions that any single city may have, the details of which are beyond a the scope of this brief message. But do not just stay in London, there is a lot more to Britain than London, so try to get out if U get a chance.
