Blimpie's KNOWS how to make proper 'cold cut' sandwiches. Although heated subs (as are more popular in the Midwest) taste good too, there is NOTHING like a good tasting New York/New Jersey type COLD sub with quality meats on quality bread, with oil and vinegar sprinkled on top of the bread! mmmmm MMMMMM!!!! I am salivating like Pavlov's dog right now as I am writing this review! Blimpie's forever!!!
