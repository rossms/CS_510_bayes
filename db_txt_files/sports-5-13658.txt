He is and will be the best coach when he retires..trust me, especially when he wins another super bowl and this time without elway everyone will know what I'm talking about...He has the respect of his players and has the best offensive mind in football...I swear on my grave that he will never lose a superbowl game in his life.....2 weeks of preperation for this genius is enough time for him to disect the best defense in the NFL......They don't call him MASTERMIND for nothing!
