They offer a nice line of phones, the calls are clear , the only thing I don't like is, they don't offer unlimted free incoming calling, I am with Cenntennial and they do offer this for no extra cost to me which is great. If I want to talk a really long time, I will call whomever and have them call me right back and talk as long as I want and not get charged for minutes or worry about going over on minutes. The sound quality is very good, not up with Verizon, but good enough.
