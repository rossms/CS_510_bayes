This movie is awesome. I think the movie was a star below the first one however, mostly because of that annoying house elf..ugh. But overall, this movie is entertaining from beginning to end, and I could watch it many more times without getting bored with it. Really cute. Can't wait until the next one. :) '''Kolby
