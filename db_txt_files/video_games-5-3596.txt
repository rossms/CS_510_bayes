Absolutely first class, superb and breathtaking!Just look at the ratings bar chart over on the right...it says it all. The chracters seem like real people, and you really feel for them. The practically non-stop action is broken only by some amazing FMV cutscenes, and some truly addictive mini-games. The graphics and level of detail push the PS1 to its very limits, and it really is the best. Harking back to the cutesy type ways of FF7, it surpasses FF8 by along shot. FF9 is by far the most versatile and spectacular game in the series, and probably the best game ever on the Playstation 1.
