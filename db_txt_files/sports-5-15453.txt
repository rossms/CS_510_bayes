Randy Moss will end up being the best WR in the history of the NFL, and yes that includes the great Jerry Rice. Randy Moss has had the best first 6 years of any WR in NFL history, and he is showing no signs of slowing up. Over the past two years, he has really matured. He's kept his nose clean, become a leader on, and most importantly, off the field. It's great to see him turn it around because he has so much talent. Seeing him finally cheering on teammates and doing what is best for his team to win is refreshing.
