WTF? Are all of you numbnuts stupid or what? Okay so the food is okay, but the pieces of cheesecake are SO FU*&ING small with so much whip cream around it to hide that fact and they are expensive!!!!!!!!!!!! When the chain started, they gave generous pieces but now they are cutting back! Not to mention that you have to wait a freakin hour to sit your ass down. My girlfriend is writing them a big, fatass long letter complaining and I urge everyone else to do the same!!
