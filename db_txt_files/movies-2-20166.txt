I actually enjoyed this one more than the original, but that doesn't mean I actually ENJOYED this movie. First of all, the title makes no sense. Shouldn't it be I Still Know What You Did 2 Summers Ago ? Not that the title makes any difference. This movie failed miserably on it's own. The only way I would've walked away happy was if that killer butchered everyone in the cast. Now that would've been a great ending.
