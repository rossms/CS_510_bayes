I love my machine! Great ground clearance, which lets it fly through the mud. It preforms well with the High Lifter ICM, that makes it out preform the Sportsman 700. I have had minimal problems. Bike handles well and it very comfy to ride. The features it has are very convenient also, such as digital dash, and differential lock. P.S. lime green is the only way to go!!!
