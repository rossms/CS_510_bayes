I think Werther's Originals are the best candy of this type. Most others I find too buttery and too rich and they give me a sick feeling. But Werther's are just the right blend, and very flavourful and nicely simple. Last Christmas I gave out several of the nice gold tins of Werther's Originals as gifts.
