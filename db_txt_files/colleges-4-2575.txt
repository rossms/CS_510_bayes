Academics here at CC are top notch. The faculty is fabulous and classes are challenging. But the student body- that's where the problem lies. The majority are either ski bums here because it's close to the mountains or whiny trustafarian hippies who protest everything corporate and shop at Goodwill while still skiing Vail every weekend and relying on Mommy and Daddy's money for all things. So a 5 for academics, but maybe a 3 for the atmosphere.
