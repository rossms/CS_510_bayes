So Much the Afterglow is by far Everclear's biggest album. I love the alternative sound without all the noise of metal rock, which Everclear does in this album. The songs like I Will Buy You A New Life and Father of Mine deal with serious issues, but are done in such a way that they can be played on most contemporary stations.
