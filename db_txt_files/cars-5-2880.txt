I have my own 99 model with the LS1 and all the trimmings. Great looks, performance and reliability. An American classic that has held true to superior style and performance. Easily beats any stock V8 Mustang and most camaros. Gorgeous car that puts the import world to shame all around. Obviously you really do get what you pay for.
