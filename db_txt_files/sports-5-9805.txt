I hate the 2002-2003 Lakers with an unmatched passion... but I watched every televised game they played. Rick Fox looks like a woman on steroids, and things don't look good for Kobe, but with Karl Malone, Gary Payton and Shaq (if his Jenny Craig approach works this offseason), they are the best team out there.
