Am I the only one who is overlooking the fact that a 48 year old man falling for a 22 year old girl...I mean, come on, arent we rocking the cradle? I think they should have made the part for Ryder 5 years younger, that way we'll have a 3 minute movie of Gere getting locked in the slammer. Title the movie: PEDOPHILE IN NEW YORK!
