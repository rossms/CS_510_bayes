I must have missed the boat on this book because the critics raved about it and I had to use my speedreading skills just to get through it. I found it painfully boring, and the main character (Jo) was an incredibly self-focused whiner, in my opinion. The horrible secret from Jo's past, which supposedly fueled a great deal of this novel, seemed contrived and overblown. To top it off, there were absolutely no interesting or even likable characters in the entire book. Now that I think about it, I wish I had given While I Was Gone a 1 rating. I was far too generous.
