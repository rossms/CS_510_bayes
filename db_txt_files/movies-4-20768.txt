Rocky Horror is the undisputable cult classic of all time, draws hoards of crowds every Halloween and of the first shots of a young, barely clad Susan Sarandon. With critics commenting not only on its blend of the Horror of Musical genre, but also the amazing fan phenomenon surrounding the film. I had to give it just a four, though, as the little Goth inside me has little sway on my less demonic sensibilities-but a 5 for the fans, you guys are the real show.
