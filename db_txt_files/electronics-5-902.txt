The phone is one of the first gsm camera phone to come out in the south. the bluetooth feature was the best feature, and along with it came the small sleek changeable faceplates. The firmware was also changable, as i changed mine to a spongebob theme. The phone had great connection and great ringtones. I have a v400 now, but i still use my t616 becuase i just cant seem to let it go.
