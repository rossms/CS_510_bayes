I'm from Illinois and I shop at a subsidary of this chain, Jewel. When I vacation out west, I can never tell the difference between these stores as both of them do offer great service to the disabled. I also see that the prices are manageble to anyone's budget though they broke the promise of card free shopping after a year of getting total control of California's market, Lucky. Best of all, the stores are always clean and up-to-date.
