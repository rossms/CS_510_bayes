One of the top five players in the league without a doubt. I don't care whether people like him or not, Kobe can play. He is the closest thing to Jordan in the history of the league. He dominates on both ends of the floor the way Jordan did. He is fearless of any situation, and is constantly working hard during the off-season to improve himself. So what about the Colorado situation! He will survive that because he has the cash to afford the lawyers who will get him off the hook. He will learn his lesson from that and move on.
