I think Janet was underrated and did not get the chance to fully develop and showcase her talents. She was in a few hit movies and of course landed the best role of her career as the desperate Marion Crane in Psycho. However, she was not really considered a serious dramatic actress and was often relegated to costume dramas or small roles. She gave great performances in Psycho, Touch of Evil, The Manchurian Candidate, and Naked Spur. She was also sexy as hell and sort of the girl next door at the same time, which is a tough combination to pull off.
