I really don't see how this movie is supposed to be funny. It's the 1980s version of American Pie, but unlike American Pie, it's not funny. However, the conclusions the main character reaches at the end are good. I liked the end of this movie a whole lot better than most. But no, it's not funny. The only reason I could see people wanting to watch this is that it's a classic and that Phoebe Cates and Jennifer Jason Leigh (this was back when she actually looked good) take off their clothes.
