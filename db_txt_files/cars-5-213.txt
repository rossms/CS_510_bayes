Great quad. I have a 2004 700 twin EFI. Its decently fast for a utility, and it crawls through anything. I've had it in about a foot of snow and even bigger drifts. Only thing is its so damn heavy. Other than that the EFI make sit snappy and so smooth. Its liek riding a snowmobile wiht a few more bumps and a litle slower.
