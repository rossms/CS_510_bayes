I must have eaten four boxes of thin mints a day when I was pregnant. I thought it was just a craving. Four years later, I still buy these cookies by the truck load when the Girl Scouts come around. I put them in my freezer (they keep good in the freezer) and delve into them after a bad day. The are so light and crispy, not to mention one of the lower fat/lower calorie cookies of the Girl Scout Cookie line.
