It's pretty frustrating. IE 5.2 for Mac consistently struggles to load images properly, and seems to be significantly slower than IE 5 for Windows. The conspiracist in me makes me think that Apple intentionally allows bugs in IE 5.2 in order to get Mac users to switch to Safari - which I have already done. Clever, Machiavellian, and extremely Microsoft-esque to do business that way.
