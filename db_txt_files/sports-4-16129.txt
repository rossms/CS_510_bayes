To say this guy stinks is an assinine comment. Vick is the QB of the future. By that I mean he can do everything. He is more mobile than any other QB. 200-300 yds. of rushing in a single game are not out of his reach. Vick throws an amazingly accurate deep ball. Watching him play QB is at least somewhat exciting in the very boring and predictable NFL. He's a heck of a lot better than that dreadful Brad Johnson who rolls around in the pocket like the Tin Man throwing 6 yd ducks. Vick is still very young and, if he can stay healthy, could be the greatest.
