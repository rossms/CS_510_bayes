Another Top 5 List maker for me. This bar is just so yummy. It's got the perfect ingredients: crunchy roasted peanuts, rich caramel, the taste of REESE'S peanut butter, and delicious milk chocolate. OMG! It's pure evil for your waistline, but oh, so worth it! I haven't made one yet, but I think it would be good in a homemade Nutrageous Blizzard milkshake. Oh, yeah.
