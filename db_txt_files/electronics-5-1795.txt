I've had this VCR for more than 10 years. I constantly use it and have never needed it repaired for it's worked perfectly all this time. In fact I have only cleaned the heads (with a conventional head cleaner available at many electronic stores) twice ever. The only problem has been that it rewinds the movies only so far -not all the way.
