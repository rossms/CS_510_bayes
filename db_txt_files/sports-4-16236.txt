I'm giving only four stars because I think we haven't seen the best from this man yet. Coming off an MVP season it's safe to say he is one of the top three QBS in the league. He is accurate (only 7 picks all season), tough as nails and he has ice water in his veins. If he can have one season in which he is not hampered by injuries he WILL undoubtedly earn the last star from me.
