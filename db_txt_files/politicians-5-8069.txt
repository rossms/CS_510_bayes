Eisenhower deserves more credit than he generally recieves for ending the Korean War as briskly as he did. We were actually fighting China and I think the long term damage to world peace of a bloodbath between Chinese and American forces lasting through the fifties would be difficult to overestimate. He also deserves credit for the highway system, a vast expansion of social security, disability insurance, and for cautious but real progress on civil rights, including appointing consistently pro-civil rights judges to the Federal courts, thus laying the groundwork for more progress in the sixties.
