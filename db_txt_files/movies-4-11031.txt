A nice family movie. An awkward teenage girl finds out from her estranged grandmother that she is a princess. She has three weeks to be transformed for a ball and also to decide if she wants to go with her grandmother to be a princess of the country Genovia. Julie Andrews is wonderful as the queen of Genovia who gets to know her granddaughter and helps her to change to a princess status Anne Hathaway did a nice job as the shy teenager who finds out she is really a princess. It is nice to see a movie that is decent and does not stoop to bathroom humor.
