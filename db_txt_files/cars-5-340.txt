I am 50 years old and have had over 25 motorcycles in my life and have drag-raced professionally since 1975. I have owned Suzuki and Kawasaki motorcycles. The 2005 Suzuki Hayabusa is still and will always be the King. The reliable and smooth king will rival any bike. Yes, I took it to the track and have driven it to Daytona from NY and it is rock steady. I am currently waiting for Vance and Hines to make a special 4into1 pipe and mapping, that is the best in the industry. Kaw,Yam,you will never catch up with the Busa and the only reason people complain is because they don't own or can afford one.
