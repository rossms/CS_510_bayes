Alabama is my favorite college football program (actually, it's one of my two favorites, but a friend got me into them so now I'm hooked). It has to be considered as one of the best college football programs ever, as its 10+ national championships (Alabama itself may claim more than 10) and well over 700 career victories say (Bear Bryant laid claim to nearly half of them himself).
