I have a TwinTurbo Nissan and I love driving it. After some mores mods in the spring I will wanna drive it all day, I am sure after helping my friend make his hit 470hp 2 years back. It is the best all around 2-seater for the buck. If you know how to maintain a sports car then turbos should be a non issue. If not then get a vette.
