Hopefully he will be our next president. He is a man who doesn't care what his party says, he cares more about what is good for the country. I wish more politicians were like that these days. He has also tried to pass a bill eliminating pork-barrel politics which is great. He is tough and has honorable military service. This sounds like my kind of candidate.
