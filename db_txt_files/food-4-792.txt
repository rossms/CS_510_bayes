Fruit Loops taste good, but something about them puzzles me. Try this at home: scoop up one flavor of loop into a spoonful and eat them, and then swish some milk around in your mouth and try each other flavor this way. Why do all of the flavor of loops taste exactly the same. Lemon, lime, orange...they're all exactly the same! Where's the fruit?!?
