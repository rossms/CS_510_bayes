the best of the star trek sreies of flims(sorry warth of khan fans) my only wish is that borg battle with starfleet had have been longer and more drawn out. you never get a real sense of a fleet going into battle and the different commands and starships. other then that i liked this movie alot and the secondary actors such as james cromwell, alfrie woodward and alice krige gave this one the feel of a big screen movie and not an extension of next generation episode. overall though a pretty good movie.
