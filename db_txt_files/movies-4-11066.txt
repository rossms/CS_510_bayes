Not a great piece of cinema, but a very funny little comedy. An excellent sendup of the conservative evangelical movement, which really needs to have a sense of humor, but can't seem to find any Bible reference about Jesus laughing. Some well-acted roles; McCauley Culkin is pretty good, which is a pleasant surprise. Somebody needs to tell me where it is written that we can't make fun of Christians? Why is this move a mean, terrorizing piece of crap? Could it be because its parodies of the Bible bangers are a little too accurate? Hmmmmmm.
