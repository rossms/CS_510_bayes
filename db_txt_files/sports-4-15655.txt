I like Chad Johnson. He is playing well and he has this list of the DBs he will be facing this year. He has to check yes or no as to if the DB covered him well or if he got open and messed up the DBs day. That's some accountability. He also has good antics, which I value at WR. I saw him giving a ball he had just caught CPR one time. That's funny.
