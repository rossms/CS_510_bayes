I like this place. I like their smartass commercials. Their burgers are a cut above the average. I agree the portions are small for the price. I like the choice of side dishes. Sometimes a crock of baked beans is preferable to an envelope of fries. Their shakes are about the best you can get these days. Try the lime freeze on a hot summer day. Culver's is still a little better, but the difference is minimal.
