I just had one of these (by accident, I was trying to be good and get a granola bar out of a vending machine but out came a Baby Ruth). What an amazing candy bar. It is so good. It has all the elements of a Snickers but it is totally different. It is a nugget middle (the nugget kind of has a peanut taste but it isn't overbearing), it is then covered in a layer of carmel so they can roll it in peanuts and they'll stick. So far, it is nugget covered in carmel, wrapped in peanuts...sound good? Well, it gets better because it is all held together when it is dipped in chocolate. It is so good.
