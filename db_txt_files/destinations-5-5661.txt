Im sick of all the mo-fo's who trash my home state of massachussetts. it's full of so many historical landmarks and museums. It has great beaches and high mountains. It has the most kick ass vacation spot in cape cod. Most of all, we massholes are a tight knit bunch who are like one big obnoxious family. You have to be tough to live in mass. It gets brutally cold in the winter and brutally hot in the summer. it develops character. And for all youguys who think we are dumb ignoramuses, we have harvard, the greatest university in the world. Don't mess with massholes cause we'll kick anyone's ass!
