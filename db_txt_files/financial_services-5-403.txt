My experience with Goldman is in New York City. I used to work in the financial services industry and I must say, Goldman stands out. Of all the firms I've met, Goldman is the only one I honestly like. This is a superb organization. It possesses talented and very personable employees who provide very good service firm-wide. If you only care about numbers and performance, Goldman can provide that. If you're interested in a little more, such as a good relationship, I think Goldman can deliver that too. I think of myself as a very critical and at times cynical person but I say here, kudos to Goldman.
