Classic horror film that, along with such classics as FRANKENSTEIN, DRACULA and THE MUMMY, put Universal on the map. Lon Chaney Jr. gives a good performance as the tormented Larry Talbot, as well as the ravenous werewolf, a character that has been branded onto our culture for all time. The supporting cast of Rains, Ankers, Bellamy, Lugosi and Ospenskaya receive a notable nod as well.
