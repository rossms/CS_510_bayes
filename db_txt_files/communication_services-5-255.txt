My excellent experience with Verizon began with the salesman. He was honest, helpful and informative (a strange concept in salesmanship today!). Since purchasing their plan we have been very pleased. We took the free evenings and weekends, (you had a choice between that, the caller ID or Caller Waiting). The reception has consistently been superb even when I am roaming, our bill is easy to read, and customer service is helpful.
