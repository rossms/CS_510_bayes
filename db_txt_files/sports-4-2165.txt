What this franchise did from 1969 to 1981 means everything to them. Because they haven't done much before or since. And they have been around since 1869. The Reds for the most part (except the 1970's of course) always seem to suffer from bad general management or ownership. Maybe that would explain why, like I pointed out above, they haven't done much of anything outside their Big Red Machine days. They've always had very good likable players though.
