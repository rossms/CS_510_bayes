Great movie. Johnny Depp if perfect as the eccentric man whose dreams are to be a director. Ed Wood was considered one of the worst directors ever.He brought us such gems as Plan Nine From Outer Space, Glen or Glenda, etc. he was a cross dresser and befriended Bela Lagosi. This movie showed Eds enthusiatic quest to film movies. this had some very funny scenes showing how he made his movies.
