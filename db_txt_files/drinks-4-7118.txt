this is a good vodka. in the beginning they portrayes themselves as craftsmen; four time distilled single batches in a handful of copper cognac stills...now they claim to be a golden circle vodka (a russian phrase meaning only the middle of the distillation run is used; this is the smoothest purest 30% of a run) .....problem is, this requires large commerical distillation machines, a negation of their beginnings, and the reason ketel one was unique to begin with.....move on taste a few others out there.
