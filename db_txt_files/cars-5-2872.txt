I have a '94 Formula with 125,000 miles. Not a WS-6, not ram air, just the LT-1 6 speed with no aftermarket mods. It's a great dependable driver with real power. I completely love the car. I've had about 30 cars and this is my third Firebird. I am completely impressed with the fuel economy, styling, and everything else about it. Handling is awesome. I would buy this car again absolutely. I believe the people who say this car is ugly are prejudiced. Maybe they're Ford heads or "mesquito muscle" enthusiasts. As far as I'm concerned American muscle rules.
