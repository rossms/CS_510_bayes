The Lager by which all others are judged; Enough flavor to satisfy yet smooth enough to be refreshing. My favorite beer! I've had this on tap and in bottles all over the world and the taste (even in Amsterdam) has been consistent. Yes, those green bottles are horrid and if you buy a six pack at your local store you're likely to get green bottle skunk.. I always buy it in either boxed bottles or in the can.
