Not perfect, but it's the most functional. And, correct me if I'm wrong, but doesn't Mozilla just feed off of IE anyway? I'm in the minority here, because I actually respect Bill Gates and what he was able to accomplish. To big geeks out there, EVERYTHING Microsoft is bad anyway, so none of the previous comments surprise me. I like it. I use it. I've tried others, but have always come back to IE.
