Penn State is a wonderful place to attend college if you like the size. It is located in beautiful central PA. State College is not a huge city like Philadelphia, but it is big and there are numerous things there to do. The only thing I don't like about it, is the number of students, but that really doesn't effect the quality of the university itself.
