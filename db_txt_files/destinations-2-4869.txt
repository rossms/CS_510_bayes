The only reason I give this rating is because of the situation down there. The people are great and its a fairly decent city, but there is way too much crime, poverty, and social unrest. The president, Hugo Chavez, is a leftist with ties to Castro and is a good friend to Saddam Hussein. Someone please kill this guy.
