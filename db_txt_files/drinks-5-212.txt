This is the first of a two part rating.Am I alone in noticing a difference? (Applies to cans in my case)OK so I cant do 2 ratings,so I'llexplain;I have noticed a marked difference between cans brewed in the UK and the genuine article from Belgium.I would have only given 2 stars to the UK brew.Can't we get anything right?
