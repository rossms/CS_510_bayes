The new 2002 Altima is so much improved from the last generation that it makes the current Maxima look less impressive than it really is. The Maxima is a great car but the new Altima's dynamics are similar (i.e. the 3.5L engine) and it costs less. I'm hoping that Nissan continues the upward trend in horsepower and boldness with the next generation Maxima. Until then, the new Altima's swoopy good looks, Maxima-like dimensions and engine has me hooked!
