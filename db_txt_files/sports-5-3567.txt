Yaz was nearly impossible to throw a fastball ball at any time in his career and absolutely owned Nolan Ryan. Played the "Green Monster" like no one else and practically won the 1967 pennent single-handed. Had it not been for a series of chronic injuries (back,wrist, etc.) his career numbers could have been even greater. Tremendous power despite average stature, his 518 foot homerun (pre-steroids and juiced ball era) still stands as the longest ever hit at Anaheim (now Angel) Stadium. The pro's pro. They don't make them like this any more.
