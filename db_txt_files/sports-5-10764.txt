I have seen CSU football go from one of the worse programs to one of the most respected. Sonny gets everything he can out of his players, program and support. CSU plays in a small and outdated stadium so I don't know how he recruits when he goes after players larger schools are recruiting. That will change next year. The facilities aren't the greatest but getting better. This year was a bit disappointing but he lost some key coaches. Lubick is a great coach and great person in the community.
