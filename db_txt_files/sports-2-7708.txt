The most overrated player in NBA history. He has three great seasons with Portland and one so-so year with Boston and he's one of the 50 Best? No way. He's one of the 50 because he brownnosed with his media work. 80 percent of Walton's career was on IL. He was a stud in college, but that shouldn't carry over to a career of injuries.
