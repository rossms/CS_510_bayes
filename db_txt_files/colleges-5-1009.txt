UC is smack in the middle of an ugly, dangerous slum. And you'll have to work hard to keep up your grades. But so what? There are plenty of diploma mills located in sunny places, that cost half as much in tuition. People come to UC because it is the best school in the Midwest (best grad school too), and one of the top 5 in the country. You'll get a more rounded education here too. Not quite as good as it was 20 or 30 years ago, but UC is still among the best.
