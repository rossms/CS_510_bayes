I have a 94 chevy blazer... I have not been overly zealous on the maintenance, but I didn't expect the transmission to give out so that I can only drive in 3rd gear! My mechanic says it will cost 3500 to fix, so now I have to trade it in and buy a new car. It is a rather clunky car with several easily breakable parts. When buying an SUV, I recommend making sure the steering is tight and the internal parts durable... no lame plastic parts that snap off or wear out.
