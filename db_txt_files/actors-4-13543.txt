I wouldn't say she's a classic beaut, but she does have something that makes her pretty sexy and watchable. She's got loads more sex appeal and TV charisma than a number of others actresses that are more conventionally beautiful e.g. Gwyneth Paltrow, Halle Berry. The bottom line, a star is not seomone who's necessarily hot looking or who can act but someone who's got presence. She has it.
