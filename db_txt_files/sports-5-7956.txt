Allen Iverson in my opinion is one of the greatest players to have ever lived. Allen Iverson has always given his heart and soul on the court. And has always remained true to 1 team for his whole career,The 76ers and hasn't thought about a trade yet. He's is what I like to think of as one of the best influences on the game. Allen Iverson has struggled through numerous injuries and has averaged over his career a 29.6 points per game and a 41.9 minutes per game. Allen Iverson is a great example of a great NBA Icon.
