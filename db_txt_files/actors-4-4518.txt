I used to be obsessed with him because he was hot, and he could act and everything, now he is just another actor to me, a hot actor though, I admit thatFlipper was a corny movie, North was a little corny, not too much, but FotR, I mean come on, SO COOL! I really don't care if he get's a bad rating by anyone else, I still think he rocks. Hugz, Babz : P
