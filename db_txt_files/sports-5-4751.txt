John Chaney represents everything that is right with college basketball. He takes underprivileged kids and teaches them life lessons; about discipline, about commitment, about passion, about team, and finally about basketball. His teams are always well coached, and usually very, very good. He wears his heart on his sleeve - which makes his players want to run through walls for him.
