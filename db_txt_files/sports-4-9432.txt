If there was any doubt that Dikembe can still be a dominating defensive presence, it was erased during the all-star game. He singlehandedly changed the complexion of the game by grabbing virtually every rebound and challending every shot in the second half. I am happy for him that he is going to get his shot at the title with the Sixers - he is universally respected and liked throughout the league, and is proving what kind of a person he is by funding the construction of a hospital in Kinshasa.
