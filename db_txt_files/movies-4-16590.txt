This is a troubling movie. Denzel Washington is a cop in Narco. Ethan Hawke is his wannabe partner. It's hard for people who make millions to play ghetto scenes believably. Washington does. Actors usually don't play dirty cops well. Washington does. And, the characters who play in the ghetto (Dr Dre and Snoop (whoever now)) have been there and they make it believeable. If you can take the gore, rent it.
