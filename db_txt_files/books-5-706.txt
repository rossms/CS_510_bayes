Words fail me: huge...great...stupendous...perpandicular... okay, throw out that last one. But the book is huge: 734 pages! It is also an excellent book, living up to and surpassing the standard set buy its predecessors, perhaps the best books I have ever read (and I've read a lot, believe me). I won't even try to explain it. It is HUGE.
