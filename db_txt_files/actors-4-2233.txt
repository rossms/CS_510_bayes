I have mixed feelings about Robin Williams. He can be a very good actor, but every now and then his tendency to seek out idealistic good guy roles gets annoying. I enjoyed Fisher King, and Williams did a great job in Good Will Hunting. But that doctor movie was just too much, and Peter Pan was terrible. Has Williams ever played a villan? Maybe I'm forgetting something really edgy he did, but it seems to me that he's taken the core of Mork from Ork and played it again and again.
