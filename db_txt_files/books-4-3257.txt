I thought that the novel was done very well. It was very suspensful; the type of novel that hooks you and keeps you reading to see what twist will be thrown at you next. Yes, the killer is revealed early, but that doesen't take away from the suspense. Due to the uniqueness of this particular villain, you have absolutely no idea what he will do next. I agree with the majority of the book critics reviews on this one; he was one of the most disturbing villains since Hannibal Lector.
