I am disappointed in Shaq falling into mediocrity in the area of foul shooting. He goes there so much, he should find some way to improve drastically. It is still my opinion, though, that Shaquille O'Neal deserves a rating of 5. Hands down, he is the single player in the league that can literally take over the game and have it revolve around him. All the hype he gets is deserved. Shaq is the most dominating player maybe to ever play.
