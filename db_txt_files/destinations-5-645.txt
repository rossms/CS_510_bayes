Stay in Quepos for cheaper housing, but be careful at night. The national park at the point of Manual Antonio is Costa Rica's smallest and most famous. Please dont feed the monkies. :-) Make sure you do a canopy tour at least once in the country, I recomend Mal Pais over Manuel Antonio, but you'll want to rent a car. Go into Quepos one evening for icecream by the local soccer field and watch a game. Buses run regularly (every 30mins) between the MA and the central Quepos bustop.
