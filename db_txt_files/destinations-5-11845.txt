I've been to alot of the zoos on this list and the Cincinnati Zoo is by far the cleanest,best organized and most eye appealing zoo I've ever visited.In my opinion the Cincinnati Zoo is one of only 3 Five Star quality zoos in the United States (for some strange reason the state of Ohio has all 3 of them in Cincinnati,Toledo & Columbus). I would rate it absolutely #1,and by far the best zoo of the 3 and consequently the #1 zoo in the United States.
