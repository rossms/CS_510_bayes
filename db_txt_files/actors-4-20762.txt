Emotional, appealing actress with classic Black Irish beauty, Kim Delaney is one of the super Snugglers who made NYPD BLue a great place for both superb drama and dreamy snuggliness. Philly was a downer, but this Cow hopes to see her in her new show soon. Her character moore than carried her own weight on NYPD Blue, both when going through alcohol addiction and the loss of her paramour Bobby Simone(Jimmy Smits). A great tv actress and a classy beauty. :=8D
