After working with several marketing people with Harvard MBAs, I've basicaly stated that I will not work with another one if I can avoid it. I don't know where to start. There definitely is an arrogance factor to them. They also don't seem to get technology very easily. At least the ones I've worked with need help compiling complicated excel spreadsheets (w/ pivot tables, etc.). They are very high level and don't deal with the details well. That's just my opinion though.
