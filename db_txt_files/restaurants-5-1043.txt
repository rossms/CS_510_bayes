Boston Market is excellent! So many choices of good side dishes (creamed spinach, mashed potatoes W/gravy, mac n cheese and their cole slaw are my personal favorites.) The service is a little slower than your average fast food joint, but the quality is much better. Unfortunately, none in Upstate N.Y. Update: My husband just called to inform me that he saw frozen Boston Market meals in the grocery store, why didn't I know about this? I am getting some tonight, I need my Boston chicken. Apparently they sell meals as well as a la carte sidedishes. This is the next best thing to having a local franchise.
