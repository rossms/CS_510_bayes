A terrific film with visually stunning cinematography and a touching tale. Robin Wiliams is his talented self, playing a character so wracked with tragedy that he really isn't able to showcase his normal humor. Cuba Gooding, Jr. was good in a role a little unique for him. The plot is what really interested me, dealing with many theories on life, death, reincarnation, and the afterlife. The real plot driving this movie is eternal love though and it's simply beautiful.
