It's too bad people like gsx and todd parker, you know, the ones who can't afford American made, skew the ratings with their one-star rating. Must just make them sick when they hear the throaty roar of a harley coming. Envy really does bring out the worst in people. Solid bike. Great way to experience the open road. Wouldn't trade it for any other bike.
