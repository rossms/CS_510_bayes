Oregon is a great place to live but I wouldn't want to visit here. What do I mean? Well, I live in Portland. Here and the surrounding erea is very liveable, green and mountainous. The fur trees are tall and and there is a lot of them. It rains a lot but when the sunny days of summer come it's beautiful. Oh! And there's still no sales tax in Oregon! But if you were to come for a vacation I'm not sure I could advise you what to do here. Maybe visit some places to look at - Mt. Hood, Multnomah Falls, the Rose Garden... I don't know.
