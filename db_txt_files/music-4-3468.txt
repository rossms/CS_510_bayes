Perhaps the best example of what I call "Disgusting Rock." The "snots runnign down his nose," stuff, etc. Some very good songs ("Mother Goose," "Locomotive Breath,") on this concept album with very little of what John Lennon once called "slog." Well played and produced. Perhaps the band's best album.
