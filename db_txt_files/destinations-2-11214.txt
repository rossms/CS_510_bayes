White Water Atlanta may be a longer drive, but it is MUCH more fun! Prices are too high, and do not include what most people have come to expect as part of the admission fee. Seems to me you can't have it both ways. A one price includes all admission, or a pay as you play plan. One OR the other, folks, not both!
