As a white american male born before WWII I have seen many presidents. I, like many americans am sick and tired of voting for the lesser of two evils. I was impressed with Colin Powell before I read his My American Journey , I am far more impressed after reading it. I do not consider him a TOKEN and anyone who does doesn't know about his qualifications and has not read his book. He is more qualified to be where he is than any other previous Secretary of State that has held that office during my lifetime. I will not only vote for him for President I would be proud, if I can, to be part of his team.
