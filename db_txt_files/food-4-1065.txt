Tastes nothing at all like the cookies but its still great. The chocolate is artificial but it doesnt taste bad like Count Chocula does. The marshmallows are a bit hard but they taste good and the cereal stays really crunchy. Why did they stop selling these in Canada?? It's really good stuff but I might not eat one box after another, alternate is good.
