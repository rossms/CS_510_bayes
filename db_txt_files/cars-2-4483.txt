Our '95 Windstar was great for 3+ years then the bottom fell out. Head gasket, timing cover gasket and transmission all had to be replaced on a vehicle with less than 36000 miles. Ford has dealt very poorly with the problems with their 3.8 liter V6 engine and transmissions. Refusing to do recalls on problems that are very expensive for consumers to fix. I need to buy another vehicle, but it won't be a Ford.
