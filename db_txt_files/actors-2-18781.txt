This guy is bad. I still can't believe all the kudos that "Pulp Fiction" gets from critics and movie reviewers. That was pure blood splatter trash. I was with a group or I would have walked out early. I chatted with patrons as they left and most were astounded how bad this flick was. The rest of Tarantino's product is just as unmemorable. Is anyone going to state that "Reservoir Dogs" or the "Kill Bill" duo is any kind of art other than slash and splatter?
