Poor customer service and when I called the corporate office in Sunrise,Florida about my purchase of bridal gifts and spoke to the woman at the that manages the bridal category, she was very rude indeed and unprofessional in every way possible. Mayors Jewelers is way over priced to begin with because their over head is obviously sky high.I will never shop at Mayors Jewelers again!
