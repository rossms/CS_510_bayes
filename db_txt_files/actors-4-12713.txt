Normally I prefer tanned brunettes with a fuller figure but there's something about Gwyneth that does it for me, even though by rights she shouldn't, especially as she's also a bit pretentious. Some of the comments about her acting ability are a bit harsh. I liked her in 'Shakespeare in love', 'Sliding doors', 'Shallow Hal' and 'Talented Mr Ripley' dammit. She's one of the few yanks who can do a convincing British accent so her acting cant be that poor.
