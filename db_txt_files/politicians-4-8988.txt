I believe that President Clinton done a good job for us. I do not think that his personal life should be of public interest unless it is illegal.I don't approve of his affairs but it is none of my business as long as he was doing a successful job for our country. I do believe that he had our interests at heart and done his job very well. Thank you Loretta K Piketon, Ohio
