Dark Side was clearly their best effort. While I revered David Gilmore I was never a real big fan of thier stuff. I thought of it as art rock and the only one that compared and did as well was Rush. Art rock just did not get me off as much as hard rock ie..Aerosmith and Montrose comes to mind. This was more my thing. It would not make my top ten.
