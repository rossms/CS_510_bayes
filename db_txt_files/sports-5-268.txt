Nomar is without a doubt the best shortstop in the history of baseball. He has won the batting titles 2 years in a row. That hasn't been done since a man by the name of Dimaggio. Thats where nomar belongs with the great names like Dimaggio, Wagner, Aaron, Mays and more. Jeter is a good player, but the yankees are Bums!!!!!
