Pretty incredible special effects/makeup effects etc. but I gotta say unless I'm making a mistake here this was the film with Keanu (sp?) Reeves and was it Wynona Ryder? Oh man is Keanu a terrible actor when he's forced to portray a moment where he's just done something other than sprint after a bus or person? I think if he's not out of breath he just has no idea what he's supposed to sound like. Wynona---- well I think she's kinda sucks too. Sorry. She does have her roles but she should know better than to try and over extend herself into REAL acting. Stick with the Heathers and Reality Bites type films.
