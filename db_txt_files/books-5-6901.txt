Great series for serious people. If you can't handle lots of characters doing lots of stuff, this series is not for you. Full of clues from front to back, hints at the world that was before the breaking. Every book has had a scene that provoked a strong emotional reaction from me ( I really hated the Seanchan in book 2, and got hoarse and misty eyed reading about Perrins battle with the Trollocs in book 4).
