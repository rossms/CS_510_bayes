The best weak side defender in the league, and one of the best all around(thus, DPOY)- He can be an offensive liability when he's outside the post which leaves teams with the option of doubling up on the quick Hamilton or the strong Billups, but that's not usually a factor in most Piston games. Though, it is a sight to behold when Big Ben gets his defense AND offense going. The heart and soul of the franchise, no question!
