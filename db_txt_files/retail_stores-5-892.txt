This is a store where I can not only find clothing that is in larger sizes but also long enough. I recently bought 2 pairs of jeans that actually fit, and I require a 34 inseam. I'd have to disagree with the earlier post saying they are catering only to the under-30 set. While I don't buy most of my business clothes there, I certainly do find a lot of casual clothes and fun or dressy pieces that fit and are flattering. It may depend on the buyer at each particular store location.
