I had a '98 Cobra, and it was the worst car I ever owned. Great fun in a straight line, but the dealers couldn't fix anything that ever happened to the car, like developing a grind in first gear with 19,000 miles on it. The car was never right, and Ford couldn't have cared less about fixing the car. This year's Cobra is temping with 385hp, but I know the company isn't behind the car, damn shame.
