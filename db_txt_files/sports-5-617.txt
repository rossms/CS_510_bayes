Papi is single-handedly refusing to let the Sox get eliminated. It's amazing that this guy was cut just a couple years ago - he has awesome power to all fields, seems to always come up huge in critical situations, and is apparently the glue of the clubhouse to boot. You just can't root against this guy.
