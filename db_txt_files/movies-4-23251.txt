A very good film, but not as good as the first Potter film. The acting and production values are all first-rate, and the plot was interesting, but the film should have been about 15 to 20 minutes shorter. Had I not read the book beforehand, it probably would have held my attention better. It was a little strange watching the film, knowing that Richard Harris had already passed away from cancer just a few weeks before. All in all, I would recommend this one, especially to Potter fans, but anyone with young kids may be in for a challenge, because they are bound to get restless before this one is over.
