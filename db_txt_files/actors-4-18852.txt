This man has so much potential. He started out doing music videos, such as 'Weapon of Choice', 'Praise You' and many others. He has been praised for those and his first film 'Being John Malkovich' is spectacular. I agree with Ruby, it is very tempting to give him five stars, but we'll have to see how he does in the future. Fingers crossed.
