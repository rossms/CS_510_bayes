I have been to many caribbean islands. None of them can even come close to the diversity, beauty and charm that P.R. has to offer. The literacy rate in P.R. is 90%, that's much higher than that of the U.S. Many of the aeronautical engineers that work at NASA are Puerto Rican born and raised. This business that most P.R.s are on welfare, is a lot of nonsense. Look at your own people before you talk.There are more whites on welfare in the U.S. then African Americans and Hispanics put together, and that is a fact!!!
