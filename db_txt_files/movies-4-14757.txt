leave it to hollywood to throw in a stupid love triangle and gratuitous love scene. wiggum's comments are interesting. i mean i don't know what makes hollywood think they're better writers than history. a lot of the better movies stick strictly to the facts or strictly to the original book they're trying to show to movie goers. other than that i think ed harris and jude law did a good job and the sets and effects (in the opening scenes especially) were stunning.
