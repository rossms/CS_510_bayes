Harry Browne recognizes that freedom in our country has been diminished greatly since the birth of our nation. I read his book, Why Government Doesn't Work and agree with him on most issues. It would be a dream if he became leader of our country. I like government as small as possible with as little tax as possible. Washington is too inefficient. Today's America is nothing like what the foudning fathers envisioned. He is the only candidate that can turn our country around and put a stop to our ever growing government.
