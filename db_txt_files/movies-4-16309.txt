Represented a real passion and suffering - it touched us we all must admit , but you have this feeling that it has the same flavour of the movie ( Brave Heart ) - thats why i gave 4 instead of 5 because it should have a different falvour he is not a guy who librates his country but he is God's messanger.. Must admit that Mel did an amazing job and the casting was perfect
