As a southerner whose visited New York quite often, I'll give it a five because the state offers everything a person could want. However, the poster (666whatever) whose slam against the south (southern wife beaters, inbreeding Nascar lovers...) reflects a small minded viewpoint that makes about as much sense as the idealology that all New Yorkers are wealthy cosmopolitans who would rather die than strike anyone, least of all their spouse. Anyone with an ounce of intelligence would know better...about both regions.
