I am a Whitehall Assistant Manager in one of the Florida stores..If any of you unhappy clients would like to come to my store, I guarantee that whatever your problems were or are, we will take care of them to your satisfaction..as for any comment about repairs, please bear in mind, we do not do the repairs on site; we are only handling them for an outside jeweler and we are always attempting to give you what you need in a timely manner. Feel free to come in and see me in the Boynton Beach store at any time...
