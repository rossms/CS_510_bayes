Though these are sold as premium cigarettes, I'm not sure why. I picked up a pack for WW2 nostalga, as these were in little four packs in rations, but as for WW2 era smokes, please, stick to the Camels or Lucky Strikes. These have the charactaristic flat taste you get from a Marlboro Red, and that's about the way to describe them. They seem more papery than the Marlboro and possibly a little lighter and thin. I will not buy these again.
