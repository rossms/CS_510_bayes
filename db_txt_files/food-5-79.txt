I grew up on Quaker instant oatmeal, still am, and it's great. Whether already flavored or plain with my own flavorings added. When I was little my brother and I would always get Maple & Brown Sugar and add maple syrup to it. I like mine super thick, like cement almost, but if you say you don't like quaker oatmeal and you've only tried it liquidy/thick try the other way cause it tastes completely different. I can't stand it liquidy personally.
