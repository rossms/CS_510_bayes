Mine is a '99, 4liter V6 4X4. It gets about 18 miles to the gallon. I like it because I've had it for 4 years and it hasn't given me any troubles yet. Knock on wood... It has about 58k miles on it and still gets me to work every day. This is my first Ford. I hesitated to go with Ford but it runs better than any Chevy I've ever had.
