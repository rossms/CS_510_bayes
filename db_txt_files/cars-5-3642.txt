Six months ago I purchased a used '99 Durango SLT 4x2 with the 5.9L V8. It's in excellent condition and has only 40k miles. I'm very pleased with it, it is comfortable, solid and fun to drive and has great pickup. Only downside is the low fuel efficiency--which can be remedied a bit by using synthetic engine oil and platinum spark plugs. Pulling a trailer is also no problem, remember to use premium gasoline when pulling a trailer (and to disable the overdrive) or operating in low humidity temperatures consistently above 90 degrees F.
