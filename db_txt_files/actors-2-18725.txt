Not really a big fan of Burton in fact I think he's pretty creepy. Edward Scissor hands I enjoyed but that's about it, actually I like Pee Wee's Big Adventure as well but that's as far as it goes. I thought that whole Nightmare Before Christmas animation film really sucked. I'm curious to see how he does on Planet of the Apes.
