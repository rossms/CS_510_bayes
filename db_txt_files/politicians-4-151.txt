Ah, Liz. They say a good compromise is one that leaves everyone unhappy. Well, she made everyone compromise to a bible version that really nobody liked as a gesture of good faith, then simply didn't change it the rest of her reign. Some think this set up the future religious wars. Others say she was able to hold it off.
