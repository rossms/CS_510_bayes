I absolutely love the New York Yankees. I can't wait till tuesday watch my boy Moose shut down the Angels. But i do have to admit that big george just keeps bringing in older guys when in reality they need to get younger. Look at the twins and the a's, bunch of young guys going out and getting the job done. If the yankees had some kind of farm system, they would unstoppable and they would not need to keep going out and getting real good veterans who's bette days are mostly behind them.
