The prices at Target are usually good and the quality is decent. I shop there more often than other department stores, but mostly out of convenience. One complaint I do have is that if you return an item without a receipt, they make you exchance the item that same day in the same department. So if you wanted to return an item from electronics, you would have to get an additional item from electronics that day. It is a lot more inconvenient than if they just issued you a gift card for the balance.
