4 and 1/2 - another outstanding job of creating a smooth flowing movie based upon a real story. Al Pacino should do more movies like this - truly an outstandin film. Russel Crowe is going to be another Sean Penn, or Dustin Hoffman - his roles have been so different, and hopefully he will NOT get type-cast. Superb film.
