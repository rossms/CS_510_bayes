Everyone looks good winning. You often learn more about a team and its coaches when they are losing. I am very proud of the way they have stuck together, taken responsibility for their own part in the scheme of things and not looked for excuses or blamed others. This is a positive mind set and a testament to good coaching. I like the way these kids have stuck together. I am proud of the way they conduct themselves. I enjoy watching them play. I would enjoy it more if Timmy could run the option.
