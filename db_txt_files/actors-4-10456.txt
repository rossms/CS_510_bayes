She is another one of those celebrities who went from a childhood actress to an adult actress as a 22 year-old. Actually I think any actor/actress who has had an acting career as a child and then blossomed into an adult actor/actress is successful. I also think that they have done a good job. Consider Elijah Wood and Christina Ricci who are in Natalie's age group. They have managed to continue their career into their early 20's so far.
