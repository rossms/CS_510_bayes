I have lived in Sarasota for almost 30 years. I was a young man when I first came here. I have to say it has changed allot and no longer the way it once was. The towns people have no repect for their history and would much rather trade it for a new Lexus. Fake and changing each day. Look elsewhere because afte 2-3 years the beach life gets old. The population mix is also changing and crime is rising. Can't wait until I leave here and find a nice town somewhere else. Very plastic here!
