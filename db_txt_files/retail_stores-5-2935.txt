I am very sorry that so many of you seem to be upset with Kay Jewelers and so happy that there are also so many of you that love all of your beautiful pieces from Kay Jewelers. I love going there and think that it's great that all of their sales people are certified diamotologists, so they really do know what they are talking about. They are also very well trained in customer service and do all they can to help satisfy the customer. I have had nothing but great experiences with the purchases I have made at Kay Jewelers.
