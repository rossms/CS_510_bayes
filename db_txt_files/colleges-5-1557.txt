I graduated from the University of Iowa in 2001 and I still think it's a quality school for the money. As far as being a party school, it's not what it used to be in the late Eighties or early nineties. After graduation, I got a quality career at an awesome computer information company. They hire a lot of Iowa graduates. I believe that this is because many graduates of Iowa are well rounded individuals who work hard and play hard.
