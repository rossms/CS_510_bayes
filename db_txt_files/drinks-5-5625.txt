What are you talking about? Sue for false advertising? What are you ghetto? Looking for a reason to make money, or just trying to be funny? Sierra Mist kicks ass! I remember the first time I tried Sierra Mist--It was like a crisp, upgrading, and Creamier virsion of Sprite...It was wonderful!! All these people who don't like the Mist are either infatuated too much in there own pop--(Sprite, 7Up, etc.)to even give Sierra Mist a chance, have never tried Sierra Mist, or have bitter taste glands. May Sierra Mist live on!
