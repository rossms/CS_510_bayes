I don't think the Mavs have what it takes to get to the finals. They have no inside presence to speak of - their offense is a pick and roll with Nowitzki and Nash 30 feet from the basket, with someone ending up with an open jump shot. This offense works in the regular season, but come play off time, it's defense and rebounding that wins games, and the Mavs just don't bring that to the table.
