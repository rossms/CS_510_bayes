He's one of the best around. He took Providence to the Final Four and won an National Championship at Kentucky.Coached in one of the greatest Collge games ever - the East Regiobal Final vs Duke in the early '90's. He just wins and can produce pro players. He fields good teams and has a strong philosophy on winning with a good book on the subject. He dabbled with the pros, failed and went back to where he's best in College. He'll be back in the Final Four soon enough.
