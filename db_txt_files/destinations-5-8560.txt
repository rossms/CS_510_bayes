I am an EMT-B in the great state of S.C. I have started dipping two years ago. I need to find a way to loose weight quick when I wrestled at the high school that I graduated from. My first kind was Skoal mint. I got hooked. Then Skoal was starting to get expinsive fast. So I started using Grizzly Wintergreen. All of my friends told me that Grizzly was nasty and now they do grizzly. They find that Grizzly is not bad for the price. I spend $16.00 on two sleeves of Grizzly wintergreen. That is not bad.
