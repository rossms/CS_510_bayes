Not the most impressive city in terms of architecture. A lot of buildings are falling apart and there's a fair amount of new construction. The place to be if you want to do some serious climbing. Lots of guiding organizations to sign on with. Also the place to catch the train (the only track still running in the country) down to Guayaquil. This is a great trip. It's this old style train the kind that haven't been running in the states for probably 60 years. After the first stop everyone climbs up on the roof as it weaves it way up and down the mountains. A must absolutely fantastic trip!
