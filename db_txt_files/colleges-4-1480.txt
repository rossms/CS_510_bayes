I attended Brown University from 1981-1983. If you don't mind living with tree-huggers and people with red or green hair, it's a great place to learn The New Curriculum. I am sounding every bit of my 38 yrs.; actually it's a top notch school that tries very hard to not take it self seriously. It is a rather expensive place to find yourself...the campus is historic and the green is a beautiful place to hang. The school's living arrangements vary, and many live off-campus.
