I had to read this book for a college class, and while it was very confusing at times (lack of chronology, grey areas that could either be literal or metaphoric, etc.) I did enjoy it. The psychological struggles between Sethe, Denver, and Beloved were moving on many levels. I would recommend it to people who like deep writing.
