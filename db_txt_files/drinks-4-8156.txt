You can't go wrong with Antinori Chianti Classico. I was a bartender at a wine bar a couple years back, and Antinori was consistently the most requested red wine. More recently, I had people over this past week-end and there were 5 bottles of unopened red wine sitting around. The unanimous choice to be opened first among labels like Bolla and Corva was the Antinori. While flavor is a subjective thing, the fact that Antinori seems to agree with most drinkers of red wine is a fact.
