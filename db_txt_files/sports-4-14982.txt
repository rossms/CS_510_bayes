Bo Jackson was the quintessential all-around athlete of his era. But as a football player, he might have been the most dynamic player of his era had he not injured his hip. He had the speed of a wide receiver and the bruising power of a fullback (remember how Bo plowed over Brian Bosworth?). It is of pure speculation where his career might have gone had he played out his career. But for the few years he was the Los Angeles Raider's tailback, he was an unstoppable force. Truly, Bo Jackson was a shooting star that left football too soon to make a lasting imprint on the sport he seemed to dominate.
