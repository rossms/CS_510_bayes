Great family beach, especially if you want to get away from the alcohol scene. The boardwalk is probably the best I have seen. Lot of rides for kids, and not horrificly expensive. A couple things do hold this back from being a five. There is a lack of nice restaurants on the island, and the amount of beach is lacking, compared to Wildwood and others.
