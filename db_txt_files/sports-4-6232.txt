I'm an IU student, so this may seem a bit sacreligious, but here i go. As my friend constantly points out, UK is the winningest college basketball team in the land and will break UCLA's 11-championship record soon enough. When Pitino left, Tubby picked up right where Rick left off and took UK right to the title. They haven't finished the job in the past couple of years, but I see 'em doing it this year....unless, of course, IU is in there!
