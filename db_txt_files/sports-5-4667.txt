Look no further than the 2002-03 edition of the Terps for a measure of how great a coach GW is. A team that lost four starters (three to the NBA, no less), that wasn't all that highly regarded before the season started, still managed to make it to the school's tenth straight NCAA tournament. On top of that, they made their seventh Sweet Sixteen in the last ten years, came within a shot of the Elite Elight, and was ranked in the Top 10 of the Final AP Poll for the fourth time in the last five years. With the incoming frosh and the sensational sophs, expect another title run within the next couple of years.
