I grew up eating this candy and so I'll probably always love it. The fact that the box comes with 2 flavours is great; the flavors are made to compliment each other so whether eaten at the same time or seperately, Nerds make a great candy. Also, they have a great, playful sorta texture. Eating nerds is almost like eating poprocks without the annoying sound (fun at first but gets annoying quickly) and since they don't pop everywhere, the flavours get to really shine through.
