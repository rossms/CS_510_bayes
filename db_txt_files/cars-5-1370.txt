The Jetta's are great. I own a '95 with 200k+ miles and I finally had to replace the starter. Still on the original clutch and I expect to change that soon too. I bought an '01 Jetta and it's a pleasure to drive. So many complain about the lack of power in the 2 liter version. Well, then buy a 5 liter gas guzzler. The car is solid and weighs over 3000 pounds. What good is racing to the next red light, anyway? And how much do you want to pay for gas at the speed limit when you can also go twice the speed limit of interstates at half the cost?
