Dave is a thoughtful, level, and strong leader. He follows his convictions, which is bound to make political animals of all stripes and spots nervous, but such leadership serves the people well. I do wish he were a better steward of the environment, though. That's very important in a place like Wyo. Don't forget the coal-bed methane mess, Dave.
