I found this movie very refreshing- finally a decent comedy these days that doesn't fall into the same maudlin slapstick routines Carrey normally chooses. No, it's not his funniest work but there are several great moments. Jennifer Aniston does well in a movie role finally, acting comfortably and naturally beside Jim Carrey. Honestly I enjoyed the sentimentality included in this movie and found it a sweet, fun piece.
