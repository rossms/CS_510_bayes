I have been dippin since I was 12 & I am a woman. I started out with Happy Days (how many remember that golden oldie?), moved up to Skoal and finally graduated to Cope. I love Cope alot, but it got too blamed expensive. I tried Redwood and stuck with it for a year, even though I didn't like it. I spotted a new brand, Red Seal around 1998 and have used ir ever since. It doesn't always have the kick of Cope, especially if you get a dry can, but the taste and mouth feel are identical to Cope. I would recommend it to those looking for a cheaper alternative.
