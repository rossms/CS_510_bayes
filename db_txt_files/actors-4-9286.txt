Kathy Bates is good, but does not really measure up to all the rave reviews written about her work a few years ago. She has put in some good performances in some off the wall films ( Fried Green Tomatoes , Misery , Dolores Claiborne ) yet often has a kind of mechanical quality to her delivery. Her role as Molly Brown in Titanic was brief but I think demonstrates this well. I think the fact that she s dumpy and middle aged yet is still cast in plumb roles causes people to conclude that she s a great actress when, in reality, she is simply a good one who has beaten the odds in Hollywood.
