Absolutely the best video ever made. I can't believe that this isn't number ONE on the list! Surely people don't think that Pink Floyd's Another Brick in the Wall is BETTER than Thriller ??? Michael Jackson might be a bit strange, but nothing can dispute the fact that he is a genius...with both his music AND his videos.
