Is Rusty on day release from a care in the community scheme? Clearly he's never even visited Austria. Unlike the US and UK, it's not crime ridden,full of neanderthal yobs and dirty. Prices are not that high either. The scenery and the towns are generally stunning and beautifully clean. The skiing's excellent and the people generally friendly.
