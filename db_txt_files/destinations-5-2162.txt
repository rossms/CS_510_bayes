Wait a seccond. Before you go click me unhelpful, Let me speak. My fiance comes from China. The Chinese culture has taught him to be polite, courteous, and fair. It is not the citizen's fault they are under a dictatorship. Do not blame the Citizens. About Tibet....That is Jiamin's fault. He is the ruler. I have to give China five stars because of the history and the culture. It is truly beautiful. And I have met the greatest man in the world who is from there.
