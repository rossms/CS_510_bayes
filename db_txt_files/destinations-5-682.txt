highley recommend cancun! the ice blue waters are breath taking.its just like the picture books. i do think thre food is way over priced.the best tasting food and best deals are down town. we took the bus, the taxi drivers are crooks ,if you take the taxi always agree on a price before you get in.never pay the first price any where.. you can knock the price down by half.i do recommend taking the ferry to cozumel to scuba or dive.its so beautiful.
