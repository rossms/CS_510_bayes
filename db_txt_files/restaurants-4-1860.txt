I have fond memories of Taco Bell because my husband and I stopped there for dinner after eating nothing at our own wedding reception! In the early days when we were on a very tight budget, it was a good place to go for dinner. The food is certainly tasty, and there's a wide variety of choices. I like having an alternative to the standard burger restaurant, too. Although we only eat at Taco Bell on road trips now, we still enjoy it.
