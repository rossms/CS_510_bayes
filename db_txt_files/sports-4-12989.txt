I have a couple of friends who live up in Oregon and OSU is the team that they talk about. With only the TrailBlazers as a professional franchise up there, college football draws a lot of attention. OSU is having a good year in the 2000 season. I am just not sure they are ever going to be able to crack into the top tier of college football teams.
