People here are hard-working, intelligent (unlike other areas of the country), and friendly. I have lived in other states I will not mention, only to return back here, my home state where I grew up. Beautiful water, nature everywhere, nice change of seasons that never leave you bored. Has nice small towns as well as big cities - can't beat it.
