Absolutely hysterical - fast paced comedy, mostly scripted, with humor mostly focusing on politics. There's a lot of Chicago humor spiced throughout, which is just familiar enough that locals and tourists will get the joke. Almost no skits fall flat, and usually a couple of years after you go to Second City, you see one of the actors or actresses on Saturday Night Live or Mad TV. Even if you don't like comedy clubs, Second City is absolutely worth seeing - a true classic and in a great neighborhood of Chicago.
