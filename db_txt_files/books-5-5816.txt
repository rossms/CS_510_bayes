I'd never actually heard of John Grisham before reading this book, but it instantly made me want to read all of his output. As well as the superb story I was struck by the language - not a single piece of of blasphemous swearing which so often pervades the trashy rubbish often encountered in this genre. As a Christian I was overjoyed to find such a writer through this book. Well done, John!!!
