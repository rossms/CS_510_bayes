AE is the best place ever! EVERYBODY in my town shops there, a&f, or other nice places. I dont know what you guys are saying about AE being expensive cuz its really cheap. Sure its more than Walmart but ive never actually met anybody that seriusly shops there. Common. They have nice jeans and tees, but their polos bug me. Ralph Lauren makes the BEST polos if you're looking!
