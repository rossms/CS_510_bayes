While I love Cape Cod, this beach is not what makes it great. The view is awesome as usual, but this beach is very crowded on the weekends, and the waves aren't very big due to some sand bars. There are no services available at this beach, like a changing room or a snack bar, and the closest parking is 3/4 of a mile away, with a shuttle bus that stops running at 5:15. I also thought the beach was rather dirty. If you want to go to a great Cape Cod beach, go to Nauset Light Beach just a few miles north, or Race Point Beach at the tip of the cape!
