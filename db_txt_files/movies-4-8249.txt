This movie has some pretty good scenes. it takes place in England. A group of friends do a bank heist. Of course it turns out they are not pals and just trying to dupe the other for the loot. Kevin Kline is especially good as the hot tempered boyfriend of Jamie Curtis. John Cleese is also funny as the uptight barrister who gets caught up in all the mess. a pretty funny movie.
