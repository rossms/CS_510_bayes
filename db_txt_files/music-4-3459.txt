Like this album a whole hell of a lot. Tangled up in Blue is a seminal song. Though maligned by many, I also like the upbeat Jack of Hearts. I always thought the songs on the album were intertwined in telling a poignant love story during the days of the old west. In actuality, the theme was based on Dylan splitting up with his wife. What do I know?
