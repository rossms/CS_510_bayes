This is a five star state. The state is clean, well run, most jobs pay well compared to the cost of living. The state is an ideal location as it is close to the great Lake states as well as southern states. The climate is not nearly extreme as those of the Deep South or the North Central. It does get cold in KY but it does not last very long. Louisville and Lexington are of manageable size and the hospitality of the citizens bring this state up to five stars. Very underrated
