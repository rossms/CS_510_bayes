oh yea!!! I've worked for Radio$hack for 4 years as a manager and hell yea, radioshack sucks. For the dude whose girlfriend, brother, sister, mother & father work at radioshack...and who claims they're all making $20/hr, I dunno what you do there, maybe you sell human parts but I've been best sales person in my district (consisting of 78 stores) over 15 times and I've barely made $20/hr. And you watch satellinte when your not busy instead of spotting-the-not and replenishing? What's your name so I can get you fired dumb ass!!!
