so many negative attitudes. cummon, this guy was 1 of the greatest backs of all time, if not the greatest. hear people talking about him being suspect when looking for those short gains on 3rd downs. any one with a clue about football knows that thats all down to the offensive line. crap blocking = no gain. i read today that he's signed for the texans. i'm delighted as every fan should be. sooo looking forward to seeing barrys moves again!!
