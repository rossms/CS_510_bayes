I'm a Montanan, and I love this state. With the exception of oceans and people, we got it all. I can leave my house and be in one of 3 National Forests within 10 or 15 minutes. 2 National Parks (Yellowstone is mostly in Wyoming, but we claim it too), rivers, lakes, mountains, plains, wildlife...it's great! Please visit, spend your money, stay awhile and enjoy yourself then go home. We've got enough people.
