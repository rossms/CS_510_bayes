Watch out for a minimum payment SCAM! I just did a balance transffer from another bank to citi to take advantage of a lower APR, but they showed me a lower minimum payment on the website than what I really owed. When I payed i didn't pay enough and the APR went up. I called them to clarify and they corrected the mistake, but I'm thinking something is fishy with all that. It could very well have been intentional.
