i purchased one of your chicken salads for lunch today with everything except onion and pepperchinois,(*i'm eating it as i type this)from the subway on Market and University, in the town of Riverside, Calif. It cost me $6.45 and i had to BEG the person making my salad to put i had to tell the person 3 times to put everything except the onion & pepperchinois. Then they did not have any salad dressing! i settled for vinegar and oil. The manager was very rude also. no customer service. i will not purchase any thing again from subway.
