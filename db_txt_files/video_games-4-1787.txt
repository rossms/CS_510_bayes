What I like about this game is that there are so many choices, you have your own home, own person, you can get merried, to me I would say its a star wars versoin of the sims, but you can go to your work and their is a lot more action, though there are many problems that need to be worked out, it is a good way to take the stress of real life off you and start getting in to your game,
