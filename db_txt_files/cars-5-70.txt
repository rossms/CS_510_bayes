yamaha banshee is an excellent bike. Sam42 is gay and don't know what he is talking about. The only reason he says yamahas don't last is cause he is pobably comparing 2 and 4 strokes. 2 strokes do need a lot more maintenance, but they will last forever. If you would do your comparisons right Sam42 you would see that yamahas 4 stroke life is 4 times that of a honda. simply cause yamahas have cnc cylinders over head cams and a lot more better technology than honda. So before nut licks like Sam42 open their stupid mouths they should compare right.
