I have owned and operated my TIVO since December 2000, and can't live without it. I get to record all of my favorite shows and all I have to do is set it to season pass and it records every episode automatically. I can pause live tv, rate shows and movies with a touch of a button, and it even records shows and movies based on what you rate. TIVO is fairly inexpensive and very easy to operate. There is even a wishlist option available to record shows or any actor/actress that is not listed yet.
