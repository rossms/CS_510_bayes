Let's put it this way: I live on Long Island, NY and I began asking people to make sure if they knew anyone in South Dakota to make sure they went to vote for Daschle. Also, I came upon this site about a week ago (different circumstances) and it was down. Was that just a coincidence or did they take it down until after the election?
