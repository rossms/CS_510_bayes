A W is the King of Root Beers -- when you get it fresh at the stand. A frosty mug of this stuff, accompanied by a hot dog and fries, is one of the essential rituals of summer. The stuff they sell in the grocery stores is OK but not nearly as good. It's competitive with Barq's and better than Mug but premium brands like Thomas Kemper and IBC are better (and more expensive). I give the fresh stuff a 5 and the canned product a 3 (this would go up to 4, however, if they put it in glass bottles).
