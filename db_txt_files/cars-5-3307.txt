I have a 1996 Jeep Grand Cherokee Limited with Quadra-trac. It has been an excellent vehicle and I would not trade it for the world. Not only does it have more torque at idle than most at near redline, but it handles great. It also has amenities that most utes could only hope for. I have 18 miradas on in the summer and 16 all-terrains in the winter, tire wear is good. I think that you people just need to maintain your ride and all is well. Daimler- Chrysler makes the best vehicles and one fine day everone will relize it! Mopar Man until I die!
