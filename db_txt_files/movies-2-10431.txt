I like Mel Gibson, I like Helen Hunt, and I really like Marisa Tomei. But - despite an honest effort - I couldn't even watch this entire movie. And believe me, I tried. I sat through Mel Gibson dancing around with a hat, waxing his legs, and talking to Bette Midler. And if I could make it through that kind of torture, you'd think I could have lasted through the entire movie. But I broke. What Women Want is predictable, trite, and dull. Ugh.
