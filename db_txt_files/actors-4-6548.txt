Richard Gere is a very talented veteran actor who has given very few bad performances. His classic performances in An Officer and A Gentleman and Pretty Woman were wonderful. He also successfully undertook villianous roles in The Jackal and Internal Affairs . However, his best performance, at least in recent years, had to be as the fame-seeking lawyer in Primal Fear . Talk about a provocative thriller. In the final analysis, Richard Gere is a great actor, and I'd give him 5 stars if it were not for those few clunker films he did, like Dr. T and the Women .
