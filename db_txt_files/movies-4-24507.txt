This is really an almost 4 it has some good moments.I was surprised to see it was not a very long movie. Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones were both good with their roles. Agent J had to go and get agent K who had quit the men in black force, He has to get his memory back to fight the aliens who have once again tried to invade the earth. There were some funny moments but this is not as good as the first Men In Black. Our kids said they liked the movie.
