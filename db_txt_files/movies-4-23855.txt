I was so impressed by the acting in this film! The performance of the main players, and especially Ashton himself, was excellent. I admire Ashton for his physical comedy (reminds me of Steve Martin), but his performance in this film showed me he can do a LOT more. The only weak point was the plot. At the end it drags. One of a few possible endings is obvious and I found myself tired of all of the attempts to set things right. The writers just seemed to drag it out too long. But, overall, a great movie.
