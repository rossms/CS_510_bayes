This is the game that got me started on strategy games, and a worthy predecessor of WarCraft III. One advantage of this installment is the naval battles (very fun); you play either Orcs or Humans; graphics are alright, I mean, considering when it came out and all. For those of you who love WarCraft: the supplement to WarCraft III is coming out sometime this summer, I'm definately looking forward to that!
