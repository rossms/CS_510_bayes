Joseph Conrad's book is a famously dark portrayal of greed, paranoia and introspection. He uses words like inscrutable and unknowable too often but the book bears reading numerous times. Usually read in conjunction with T.S. Eliot's The Hollow Men, Heart of Darkness is also an interesting contrast to Moby Dick.
