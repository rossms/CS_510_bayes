I've had pretty good luck with Dillard's. I've shopped there most of my life. I've heard some people say that the sales people aren't as nice to you if you're dressed sloppily, but my response to them is this: don't dress sloppily. Their customer service is really quite good, particularly in the cosmetics department. They have great sales, too. My sister in law gets a Dillard's gift certificate from my dad each Christmas, and she holds onto it until Dillard's has its 75 % off sales. She gets some great bargains and she really racks up.
