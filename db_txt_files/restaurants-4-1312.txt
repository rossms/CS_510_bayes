I like some of the food items at Arbys, it is a nice change of pace from burgers. The Market Fresh sandwiches are good. I have always like the super Arbys. they have tried to improve themselves by coming up with new sandwiches while keeping their old classic ones. the prices are reasonable especially with coupons they offer. They are one of the only places I know that offers a jamoca shake.
