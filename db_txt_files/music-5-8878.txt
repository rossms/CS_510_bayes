A beautiful song, sung beautifully! I LOVE THIS SONG! It expresses EXACTLY how I feel when I am in love. I keep on fallin' in and out of love with you, I never loved someone the way that I'm loving you.... how do you give me so much pleasure and give me so much pain? Alicia Keys is soulful and rich and very talented and I predict that she will be around for a long, long time! If you haven't heard her, you should go listen now. SHe stirs passions in my soul. I bet she will for you too if you enjoy R B. I love ya, ALICIA!!! You go GIRL!!!
