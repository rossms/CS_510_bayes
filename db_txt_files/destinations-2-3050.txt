Dirty as hell! Too many homeless and bird droppings. Overcrowded and overrated. The cable cars are neat, but run terribly. This city wouldn't know customer service if it hit them upside the head. Chain restaurants that you're used to change their menu for San Francisco, leaving you disappointed. Harbor cruise around Alcatraz is cool, but best time is in Sonoma and Napa Valley to the North, crossing the Golden Gate, and Monterrey to the South...spend your time there
