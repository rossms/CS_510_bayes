The quality of the chicken at KFC usually varies from location to location, something unusual for a fast food chain. In some of the restaurants, the chicken is plump and tasty. In other places, there is way too much skin and not enough meat. Also, the chicken may not come out well cooked. But all and all, the food there is very good. I like the sides, definitely it's above-average for a fast-food chain.
