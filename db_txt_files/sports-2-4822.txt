REVISED: While Cliff Ellis did well at Auburn (in my opinion), he was fired recently. Of course this is the same Cliff Ellis who got run out of Clemson because he could not compete in the ACC, notwithstanding some lower expectations. Average at best, but perhaps he just continues to need a change of scenery.
