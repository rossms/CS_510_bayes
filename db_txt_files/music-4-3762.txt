It pains me to give these guys anything less than a 5, but this wasn't their best album. The production value, as always, was phenomenal.Pink Floyd was one of the few bands from that era that recorded their stuff in QuadraPhonic Sound, which was an early form of surround sound stereo seperation. Which contributed to that spacious ambience heard in their music.
