Bill Cowher apparently thinks he is coaching Pittsburgh High School's JV team with all his yelling and posturing. He is not a pro coach and never will be. He has lost more AFC championship games at home than most of the rest of the coaches in the AFC have even been to. You can take that as a compliment or a sad commentary on a man who is simply not in control of his emotions.
