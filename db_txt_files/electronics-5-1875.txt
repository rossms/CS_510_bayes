No point in just calling this system Good when it's Great. This beats the PS2 in every single way. The graphics are better, the processor is faster, internal memory, and you can copy music. There are many other great things. Both the PS2 and Xbox are equally guilty for making you buy optional parts. The PS2 needs memory cards and the Xbox needs a DVD Playback Kit. They both cost around 30 dollars. The controller is also a little better for adult hands. The games may be more limited, but they are better, especially since I am an RPG hater.
