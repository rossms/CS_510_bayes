It had been some time since I watched this movie, and in my last review of it I really trashed it. But I guess the years have done something to me, because this time around I really enjoyed it. Slyvester Stallone was so raw and full of talent during this film that you could almost feel it...the only thing I didn't like about this movie was some of the supporting cast..they just were such extreme overactors that it was almost pathetic...but I now own this movie..and I love watching it on rainy afternoons.....good movie !
