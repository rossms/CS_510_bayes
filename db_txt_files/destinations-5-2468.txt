I live in St. Petersburg. It is one of the prettiest cities around. The sky is full of gorgious colors when the sun goes down. On St. Pete Beach, specifically Pass-A-Grille, the beaches are pure, white sand. The water temperature in the summer reaches the 80s and the water temp in the winter reaches the 70s. Not to mention how clear and beatiful the waters are. Totally Perfect conditions.
