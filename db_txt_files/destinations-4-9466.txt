A four for the bridge because it's just too crowded. There should be some limitations of shops and display areas on it but it's difficult because there have been. When I first saw it, I was disappointed because I expected something like the great bridge on Canal Grande in Venice, something more elaborate architecturally. But still, it belings to the city as the Statue of Liberty to NYC.
