I've had Pac Bell for just over a year, and the first time we went out of state (California) there was no service from here to Arkansas. No access, no roaming, nothing. Not even in areas that are supposed to be included in the California/Nevada service area. Also, it doesn't work in several locations within my home town, or in several towns I frequent. So, what good does it do to have cellular service for emergencies, if it doesn't work when and where you need it? I am currently looking at other wireless companies, Verizon included, there has got to be one out there that is better than what I have now.
