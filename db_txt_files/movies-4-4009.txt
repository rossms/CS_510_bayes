This movie should be yanked from the theatre! It teaches kids to disobey their parent(s) and everything will turn out great and exciting. Just kidding. With all the great reviews I couldn't resist. I loved Dory and the technical + artistic brilliance. I knew about Pixar before Toy Story. I saw that lamp short at an animation festival movie. I wanted to buy stock in the company but didn't have any money. It'll be great to see what they do next.
