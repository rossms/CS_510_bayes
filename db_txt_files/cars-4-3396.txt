A very good choice for a compact SUV. As usual, reliability has always been excellent. It shouldnt be off road, and cargo room is small, but Rav4's are the longest lasting compact SUV's. Very good gas mielage. If you need more room, the only real good choice in a compact is the Escape. Both the Rav4, Wscape, as well as the CRV are my only recommended small SUV's.
