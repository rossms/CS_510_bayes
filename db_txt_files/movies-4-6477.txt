good thriller. Two men meet on a train have a conversation of some problems in their lives. one suggests how interesting how it would be to trade murders with the people who are causing them problems. one takes it serious and follows through and expects the other to do the same.well done and acted the final scene with the merry go round is great.good Hitchcock movie.
