I was thrilled to see these in the frozen food isle. We would often get take out when we lived in Maryland, and now that we live in Upstate NY..there isn't a Boston Market to be found. The half chicken and mashed potatoes are good..the creamed spinach is almost what I remember from the restaurant..however, the prices are a bit too high for frozen food.
