Only 30 miles of paved roads on the island. If you want to see anything, you must rent a 4wd vehicle. So not only is sightseeing breattaking but adventurous as well. Loved Shipwreck Beach, Garden of the Gods and Polihua Beach (strong currents there so no swimming) but on the day I visited no one else was on the beach---2 miles of pristine white sand beach all to myself. This is a beach with some great privacy. Lanai is an island not to be missed.
