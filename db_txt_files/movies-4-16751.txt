The makings for an excellent movie were there -- that much is for sure. However, there was not enough build-up to Dickie's murder. In fact, the whole exchange on the row boat ( You're boring... -- Oh yeah? Well you change your mind too much... ) was completely unrealistic and stupid. The acting was decent, for the most part. Paltrow and the snobby friend were especially good. All in all, the film really doesn't compare with Blue Noon -- the movie on which it was based.
