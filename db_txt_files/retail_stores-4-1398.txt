Target is a satisfying blast of fresh air (compared to the spirit-deadening trudge through ANY Walmart). Excellent parking, deep-well carts that run straight and true, shiny floors, different selections of items, etc. A tad on the high side, price-wise (always look for sales). Amazing place to go muffin-watching (attracts a copious amount of good-looking females). THE best-looking cashiers (of the five women at my local store, three qualify as supermodels). As long as they don't drop the ball, look for Target to dominate the retail business in the next 25 years.
