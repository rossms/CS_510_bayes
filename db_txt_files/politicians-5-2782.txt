J.C. Watts is a great man, and was a great politician. He has a mind of his own. A previous poster said he was denying his own heritage . And I thought the liberals weren't supposed to be racist. Black conservatives should be treated with the same respect that any other politician should be treated with, not with Democrats calling him an Uncle Tom . That is racist in its own right.
