starts out as an embarassing attack on the tasteless shock value of today's reality shows, but turns into a compelling character gallery. watching how people act under the compulsion to kill involuntarily, just for ratings, is fascinating. you have to wonder what kind of state would force this kind of tv game- the movie never shows you. i'd give it five stars, but it's based a lot on surprise and suspense, and i don't think i could enjoy it as much again.
