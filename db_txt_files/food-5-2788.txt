Zagnuts are awesome! They're the same concept as chic-o-sticks but amazingly good instead of sickly hard and disgusting. Zagnut's peanut butter is smooth but there's a crunch to it as well and the toasted coconut tastes great. When you want a candy bar but don't feel like chocolate, Zagnut really hits the spot.
