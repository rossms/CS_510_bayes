One of the funniest films that has come out in the last few years that features teen actors. This was a very ibg improvement over American Pie because it did seem to have a plot. I really liked the comedy along the trip and the subplots such as Tom Green's obsession with the snake. The ending was very well done as it turns out that they made the entire trip for nothing. Definately worth renting!
