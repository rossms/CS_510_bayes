Originally published in 1978, The Stand is one of Stephen King's better works (if not his best). For the uninitiated, the concept of novel is a military germ warfare experiment gone bad, resulting in the mass near extinction of human life and other species. The few survivors are diverse, but all seem to have a mystical urge to group in competing good v. evil camps. As other comments have noted, The Stand is lengthy (over 1000 pages); however, this allows for a more complex story and character development. The admittedly weak ending causes a loss of a star, but the ride there is worth it.
