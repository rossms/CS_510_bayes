Dude, McNabb doesn't even hold a candle to Manning, in anything. Manning has almost twenty passer rating points over McNabb and eighteen more touchdown passes last season. Manning also has eight hundred more passing yards than McNabb. Manning can also execute more creative and efficent plays. He has a wider range of what he can do as far as play excution goes: shovel, long, pitch, ect. I do not understand why McNabb ranks so high on this list and Manning so low. They'er not even in the same league.
