puts on an enthusiastic, lengthy, if not a little too coreographed show. the only complaint i ever have about seeing Bruce is the $80-$100 ticket fee to see aging millionaire hop around the stage. has a tendency now to play artist and demand quiet from his audience when he plays Important songs like 41 shots or the ghost of tom joad.
