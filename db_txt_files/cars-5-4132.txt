My rating on this vehicle counts because I OWN one. Maybe it is ugly but it performs great. I have an AWD 2002 and have been happy with it since I drove it off the lot. I can't believe that anyone could rate a vehicle base on looks alone. It rides like a car but I can haul almost anything with it. It has all the comforts of a much more expensive vehicle. It confidently goes through rain and snow without hesitation. I hope that Pontiac will continue this line.
