His footwork and mechanics aren't exactly textbook, his arm strength and accuracy are mediocre, but he'll release quickly, dump it off to the flats and short routes. He's good within the West Coast system they've got. He'll spread the ball around. When the play breaks down, he really shines. He'll turn bad situations around by scrambling. The other side of that, though, is that he's very impatient in the pocket. If his primary isn't open, he'll take off and run. He doesn't go through the progressions.
