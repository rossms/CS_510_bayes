Bobby Bowden is the best coach of all time, all those who say he recruits from prisons and says they are all murderers tell me the last time someone from florida state has killed anyone never! someone from miami did though i.e.-Ray Lewis. And another thing, 7 out of 9 ACC teams made it to bowls so its not the easiets too, bowden is just a great coach and FSU is a great team.
