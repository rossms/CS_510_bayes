Before I ever tried this stuff I just figured it was some cardboard-tasting Total ripoff. But boy was I wrong. It has a refreshing sweetness to it, making it taste kind of like Honey Nut Clusters only better. I honestly can't believe this stuff has so many vitamins and minerals, etc. in it because it's just so delicious. As much as I hate to sound like an ad for this stuff, it truly is a smart start to your day. ha.
