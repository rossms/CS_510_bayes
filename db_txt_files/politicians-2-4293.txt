I hate to say this and I'm sure the ones who hate me on RateItAll will use this against me, but here goes anyway. Mr. Lieberman's voice is very irritating and I can't seem to get past it. He is I'm sure, a fair Senator. He just needs to have someone else talk for him. Ok, I said what you were thinking, now About how Al Gore, you know Mr. personality, he treated the Senator very poorly. He killed any hope of Senator Lieberman becoming President. Gore is a poor leader in my book, but that's another chapter.
