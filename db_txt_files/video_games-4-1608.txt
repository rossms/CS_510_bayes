This game is really fun and you'll play it several times. The environments are stunning. I personally feel that I'm really there every time I look out across the Cape Claw area. Any fur also shows up real nicely, thanks to Rare. Too bad there'll be no more GC games by them. ;-; The controls are easy to master and there is a programmable shortcut button. The game is rather easy, but some of the puzzles and mini-gameds take some time. Overall, it's a nice Zelda-like game to spend some time with.
