Since he came into the league, Pettitte has been one of the most consistent pitchers in the game. He has a nasty cutter (which he fortunately is no longer obsessed with) and the best pick-off move in baseball. He has also come up big in many big games for the Yankees. Overall, he is one of the better, and most underrated, pitchers in baseball.
