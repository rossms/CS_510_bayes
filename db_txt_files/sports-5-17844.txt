I love my team! Brian Billick is an excellent coach! He combines the best of many worlds; tough when he needs to be, takes no crap from the media, treats his players with respect when they earn it and is a computer guru which is an assett to coaching in the new millenium! Our team has heart, soul and doesn't let the media's and people's disdain thwart their excellence.
