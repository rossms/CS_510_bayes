A fine seafood resturant. Resonable prices and good food. Not great food, but very tasty and enjoyable. The staff is always friendly. It is a chain resturant and though it tries not to appear so, it still defintly shows through. The menu has a little variety, and you can propably find something that appeals to you. But if you want authentic food from the sea, I suggest you find another resturant.
