Great middle of the line ski!! It s only 701cc, but has 95hp- which is one of the highest for a 700 class. It tops out around 55, and pulls skiers up just fine. I ve raced just about every other ski in it s class, and it kills them all (even with 2 people on the ski). Polaris has a great engine, and great customer service. I have 40 hours on mine, and is running perfect!!
