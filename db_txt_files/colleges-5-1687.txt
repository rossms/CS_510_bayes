A great academic environment that lacks the arrogance of the University of Virginia. To the guy who quotes T. Jefferson on W&M....did you know that TJ died owing William & Mary (as well as many other notable Virginians of the day)a lot of money? Maybe that colored his attitude towards his Alma Mater?
