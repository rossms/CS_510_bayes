My favorite city in Italy. Siena is a warlike fortress which is as menacing as Florence and Venice are aesthetically pleasing. Motorcycles roar through narrow fortress streets late at night, creating an environment which you will not see elsewhere on the Italy tourist route. The main square is awesome and foreboding, with warlike statues everywhere. Also, Siena is also home to one of the biggest parties in the world - the Palio - in which top racehorses careen through the mazelike streets.
