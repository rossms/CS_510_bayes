It appears that he communicates well with his players. Also their is a mutual respect between coach and players. I had an opportunity to see him with the All Star players this year and he made it very enjoyable to watch the little practice. He allowed the team to relax and have a good time. I'm sure he is different with his team, but still I think he still allows them to enjoy themselves.
