Poland loves Reggie!!! J think he is the best SG ever(except MJ), the best clutch time player. He is so agressive in the game, he's the real Killer ,he's ratings are perfect and J just don't know why people in the USA dont like Reggie! Since 1986 he's givin you real emotion and divine and he deserve for respect from all people. Reggie- Europe loves you!!! mikolaj rogozinski
