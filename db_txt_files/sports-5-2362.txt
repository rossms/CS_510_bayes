Hopefully Buck Showalter will finally get to reep the benefits of putting together a championship team. World Series victories for both Arizona and the Yankees have his fingerprints all over them, but he wasn't kept around to enjoy either. This team shocked some people in 2004, and young players like Michael Young and Hank Blalock are no longer such a secret. As it always seems to be, the question mark is pitching. Just one solid starter could be what takes this team to the World Series.
