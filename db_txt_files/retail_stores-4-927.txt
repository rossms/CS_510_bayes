I like A&F. I don't shop there a lot bc their prices are quite high.. but their clothes are cute.If you don't like A&F..don't shop their. Don't be slammin people bc they wear the clothes. Everybody has their own style they like, and if you don't like A&F's style...who cares...bc i doubt your any type of fashion expert.
