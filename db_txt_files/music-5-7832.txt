What a great video. It's funny, imaginative, and silly. It's not just an advertisement, it's a piece of art. It's not all about making the artist look cooler and more good looking than he really is. It's about the song, even though the video and song is not completely original. It can get away with it because it doesn't take itself too seriously.
