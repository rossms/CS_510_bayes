I went there in middle school, which was very long ago. However, this place is so very beautiful. I also went snorkeling in Molokini crater.World-famous Molokini crater is a half-submerged extinct volcanic crater just off the Maui's southern coast. It is one of Maui's most popular snorkel & dive attractions. In the waters around Molokini, you'll find hundreds of tropical fish. One of the best experiences of my life. I Can't wait to go back for my honeymoon.
