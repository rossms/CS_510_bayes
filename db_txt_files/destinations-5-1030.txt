I wouldn't want to live anywhere else. All the stories you hear about sharks and crocodiles - forget it! It RARELY happens. And I stress rarely. I've heard of about 2 crocodile stories in the last 8 years. And one was a German tourist who went swimming in an area with a sign DO NOT SWIM - CROCODILE WATERS. She was even advised not to go swimming. It is the safest country on earth, and the most diverse. And fortunately, we don't have to worry about firearms anymore.
