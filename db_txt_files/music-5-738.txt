I have always been a die hard Alanis fan. I think she writes the greatest songs. I was looking forward to her follow up of Jagged Little Pill and was not disappointed at all. This album preserves the Alanis angst and the deep lyrics that all Alanis fans love. With this album, Alanis has proved that she is not a one album wonder. My favorite tracks are Thank U, Baba, So Pure and Unsent.
