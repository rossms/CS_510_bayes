The most underrated governor of all time. Nicknamed "Governor Moonbeam" for proposing that the state tap into satelite communications technology - something the state, along with nearly every other state, would eventually do. California's educational system was in the top 5 during his terms as governor, and dropped to the bottom 10 due to a combination of Proposition 13 and 16 years of Republican rule. I should add that he has dramatically improved Oakland's economy and fiscal condition during his time as mayor.
