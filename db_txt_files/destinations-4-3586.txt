Hey they are great. Beautiful airport, nice area, clean city lots to do here are some sites to visit...mall of america, minnesota zoo, science museum, france avenue(for great eating) valley fair, target center for shows and other activities, chanhassen dinner theatre, and so many other interesting sites and great shopping and restaurants. The twin cities are probably some of the cleanest cities in the u.s. !!
