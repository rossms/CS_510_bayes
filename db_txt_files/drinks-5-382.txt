It's a good beer and I always had a soft spot in my heart for it. About 40 years ago I was in Harry Truman Airport in Charlotte Amalie. They had one of those old fashioned coolers, the kind you see with sodas hanging by the neck in row tracks. You would put your money in and then pull the soda down the track and out. Well here they had a whole cooler of bottles of Carlsberg. It was a fun wait!
