Typically I do not like flare or flash but for some reason, as cocky as he was, I liked him. I cannot explain. A great homerun hitter, by no means one of the best ever but his World Series accomplishments were unreal. Honorable mention: 1971 All Star game when he launched one into a transformer on the right field roof at Tiger Stadium. The ball was still ascending when it hit. An amazing shot.
