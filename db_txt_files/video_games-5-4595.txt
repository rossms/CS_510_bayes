well, it's like an AD D version of diablo, since you mostly fight, but there's some kind of atmosphere in it, like an adventuring fantasy novel, you travelacross the freezing winter of icewind dale on your quest to do something that i don't remember right now, and there's a kind of novelist atmosphere to it. definetly an interesting experience.
