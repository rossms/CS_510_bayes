I was not going to comment until I read some of the racist comments against Jews. First of all, You people saying that prejudiced drivel, You are the reason for all the terrible things happening in the world today! And as for the abortion, Jeez! Stop shoving your religion down every non-Christian's throat, Noah! I don't have to read your bible, Got it? Noah, You are exactly the type of person who would vote against abortion even to save the life of the mother. And I hate how you keep shoving your Christian views into other people's faces. You make me sick, Noah.
