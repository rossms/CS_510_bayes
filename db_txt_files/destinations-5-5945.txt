Alaska has its own unique flavor that one can't experience unless that one sets foot on its soil. Of course, that would be true of all places, wouldn't it? The outdoors of Alaska are incredible, and I, personally, wouldn't have been able to comprehend it had I not been there. So go there to check it out. The people change from region to region. Overall, they were different from what I'm used to, and I appreciated that. By all means, go to Alaska to understand. Don't go though if you're looking for any kind of exciting nightlife.
