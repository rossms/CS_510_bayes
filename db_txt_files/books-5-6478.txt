This is still Woodiwiss at her best. This is one that is worth rereading every 2 or 3 years. The only thing out of the whole book that I found a little bit hard to relate to was the way Heather is so accepting of the way she is treated on the ship. But, even that is believable when we remember that she had been beaten down before she met Brandon.
