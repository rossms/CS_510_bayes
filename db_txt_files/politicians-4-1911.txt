I am not a huge fan of most Republicans, but I have not seen or heard anything bad about this guy. He seems to run Florida quite well. Alot of things that weren't good in Florida seem to be improving under his watch. Overall he is a pretty good governor. I couldn't imagine anyone else running the great state of Florida...
