I own a 2000 Landcruiser that has been reliable and trouble free through the first 50,xxx miles. The V-8 offers plenty of smooth delivered power and a firm but decent ride. Around town MPG is about 12-14 MPG, and Highway 16-18 MPG. The fit and finish is impecable. Although somewhat pricey, the Landcruiser promises to be an excellent long term vehicle making it worth the extra bucks. I don't think a comparable GM product, Chrysler, or Ford will give its owner the long tern relibility and satisfaction of a Landcruiser.
