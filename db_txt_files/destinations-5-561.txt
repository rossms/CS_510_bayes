Like I've said before I've lived in Puerto Rico and obviously you so called tourists haven't been to Luquillo beach because that water is very clear. And about it being dirty every place has its imperfections. Look at NY not the cleanest but the best place. Some of your comments were hurtful to me and I'm just a kid so re word what you say.
