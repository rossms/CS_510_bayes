This is hard to rate, because you would have to rate each terminal separately. Four is good, except in the AM when arrivals is a zoo. Three is a dump, period. One is okay. Two is old. Five is still under construction. Connections to Heathrow are poor for the volume of travellers. Heathrow should have been closed back in the 1960's and a large 24hr airport with six runways should have been built East of London. The Tube (Picadilly Line) to Heathrow is a decepit, overcrowded joke. Commuters have to use it too!
