Tom Hanks,(though I'm not a great fan)gave his best performance yet but I was constantly drawn to the performance of Davis Morse (Brutal). The absence his subtle support would have given this film a very different reception. Here is a guy that has the light shade face that made stars out of actors of yesteryear, but has been missed by film-makers of today. Nice to see a film that was not prostituted by special FX.
