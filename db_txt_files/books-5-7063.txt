I began with reading the 2nd book...read it in approx. 2 days and found out it was indeed the 2nd book. Immediately looked for more and found nr.1 and 3. Nr 1 was a bit disappointing, probably beacuse I read nr 2 already. Nr 3 was very good- Finally he gets in touch with his real powers! A bit saddening at the end though. I am hopeful that perhaps there will be a prequal? Please Hobby dubbie doo?
