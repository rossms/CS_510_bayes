an open zoo not full of cages and bars, the Miami Zoo offers a wonderful experience to see nature's best running around freely with plently of space. Some exhibits even have an up close view to see the animals. Miami Zoo is a great value for the price and a fun day for the kids - you'll do yourself a favor by avoiding July-Sept when the temperatures get unbearable. Also, the Zoo offers a free tram from one end to the other but you can see everything walking, even in just one day.
