I've only been to Chicago a couple times during the last year or so on business, but my initial impressions are very positive. The downtown area is clean and feels safe, even at night. The people are by and large friendlier than in NYC or LA. The pizza is the best. And, the weather is not as frigid as everyone thinks (both of my recent trips were in winter)--certainly no less bearable than NYC or Detroit, and from what I can tell better in general than Minneapolis or Boston. I hope to get back to Chicago for fun one of these days, and take in a game at Wrigley and see some museums.
