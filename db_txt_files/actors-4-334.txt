Holden was a very natural actor who made it look so very easy. That always requires a lot of talent. Ironically, I think this may have also been the very reason he remained somewhat unappreciated in his lifetime. It was as if he blended into the fabric of the film almost too well. But he was very gifted and from what I gather from his bio, also respected by his peers as well. For me, his most memorable film was Sunset Boulevard in his classic role as the young man torn between ambition and self-respect. Very believably done.
