NHL Hitz 2002, it was the first game I got for my XBox. The reason I only gave it a four is for the nonsense scores I get. I can easily beat the computer 10-0. Of course, it was the first hockey game by Midway, and the 2003 version was better. I have nothing else negative to say. It's just too good.
