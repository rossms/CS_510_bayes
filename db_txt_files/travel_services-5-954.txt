I had a very good experience with Bekins when I moved from Florida to San Francisco. For an entire one bedroom apartment's worth of stuff, they gave me a quotation of about $2,000 fully packed - anywhere from $300-500 less than some of the other big players like Atlas and Mayflower. The driver was hardworking and professional, and while they did break two items, my overall experience was very positive.
