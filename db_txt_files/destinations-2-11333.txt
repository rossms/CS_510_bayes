Tahoe's a skiing, snowboarding, hiking, camping, canoeing, drinking, barbecueing, all-around awesome weekend getaway - the gambling's just a minor extra perk. The scene's pretty weak, with a few large casino's like Harrah's and Cesar's but it's just a very small gambling strip. If you're looking stictly to play you're far better off making the hour or so drive to Reno.
