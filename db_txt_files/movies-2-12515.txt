I lost a bet with Martha, and in almost heathenish glee, her payoff was to go to "Brokeback Mountain." Well, dear readers, I have seen it all now. This is a REVERSE chick flick. The women are still blubbering, sobbing and flocking to see it. This shall start a new trend, I'm sure. As to content, BOOORING!
