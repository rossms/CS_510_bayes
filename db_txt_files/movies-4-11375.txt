This movie had a really good story line. It sends out such a positive message to young people. It sends the message that it is not the body which determines a person's beauty, it is the level of their goodness. If it wern't for the pre-marital sex scenes, and the crude scenes and cursing, this movie could have been a Christian movie. It had such a wonderful ending.
