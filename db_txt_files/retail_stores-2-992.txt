i swear this is true: i was working last year and my store is upstairs and across the way from A F. The DM was outside the store with all the kids lined up outside the front window. He was pointing and asking certain people to step out of line. turns out he was firing the ones that didn't fit the image: anorexic-strung-out-on-heroin--nambla-material.
