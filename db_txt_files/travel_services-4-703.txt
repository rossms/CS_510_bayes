The best thing about National Car Rental is that they're big on the one way rentals. If you've ever tried to rent a car and drop it off elsewhere you know what a pain this can be, and how expensive (if even possible) it is. National, though, allows one way rentals to just about all their locations. Recently, a friend had to get to an airport about 2 hrs. away and for $30 she could rent a car and drive it herself. Pretty good.
