Stouffer's French Bread Pizzas have been a staple of my diet for several years now. I always cook them in the oven (as opposed to nuking them), and I douse them with tabasco sauce. My favorites are Pepperoni and Supreme. I prefer the French Bread to the round pizzas because you don't have to deal with cutting them - they are ready to go as is.
