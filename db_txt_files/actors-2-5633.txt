Anybody remember a piece of dreck called RUSTLER'S RHAPSODY, one of the worst westerns ever made? It litterally made me sick. I threw up all over the box office on the way out after seeing this flick. It wasn't a pretty sight. (It may have been a bad box of popcorn and three cokes, but I don't think so!!) Anyway, since then, I have suspected everything TOM BERENGER has starred in. I just can't get the bad taste out of my mouth.
