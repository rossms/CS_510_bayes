Yesterday I bought Amy's Shepards Pie. I was however quite skeptical because 1) Shepards pie is typicaly made with BEEF not all vegetables, and 2) The pie had only 160 calories! Is that a meal? Well I found it to be suprisingly delicous AND filling! I definaletly recommend this product to someone looking for a healthy quick meal that doesn't taste like the container it came in!
