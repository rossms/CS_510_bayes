Definetily overrated. Socialist (at best), dictator. Came from the socialist, elitist North East. More like Hamilton than Jefferson. Like Clinton, who used 'the children' everytime he wanted to hoist an new social program on over taxed Americans, FDR used the 'people' the same way. Why did such a great president allow the internment of US citizens of Japanese descent? They fought bravely in Europe.
