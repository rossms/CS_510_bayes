Built his career on JUCO talent (just like Barry Alvarez in Wisconsin), and although some people might say that JUCO talent is fools gold, there was really no choice. Even after all his years of success, it was nearly impossible to get blue-chip high school talent into Manhattan. They should put up shrines to him in Coffeyville and Dodge City. And you Husker fans: don't sneer at Snyder. Look and see the percentage of JUCO players in Bill Callahan's last two recruiting classes (7 out of 19 so far in 2006, 12 out of 32 in 2005).
