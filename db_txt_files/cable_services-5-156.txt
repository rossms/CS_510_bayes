after dealing with incompetent cable companies for many years, i made the switch to directv almost 5 years ago and haven't looked back. i have access to about 5 times as many channels, and nfl sunday ticket as well. since i have had my system i have lost reception maybe twice a year. my monthly bill is a minimum of $100 and goes as high as $150 depending on what i am watching, but the rates are pretty steady and with my tivo i can pretty much watch anything i want, any time i want.
