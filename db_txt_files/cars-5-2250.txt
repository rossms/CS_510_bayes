The 1990+ 300zxTwinturbo is the Pioneer of Japanese Super Sports car History ...This is the Sports car that started it all and this car still is the best in LOOKz/ Speed / Handling / Reliablity /Price ... what more can anyone need .. I own a 1990 300ZX TT and I love it and plan top keep iot forever ... GREATEST SPORTS CAR EVER MADE .... The SUPRA TT COMES 2nd to me because it came out 3 years later Toyota in every way had it's chance to refine and modify each and every thing that the Z lacked in but for that came a $10,000 + price tag ..... Nissan's King Car 300zxTwinturbo is # 1
