Lou Gehrig teamed with Babe Ruth to form baseball's most devasatating hitting tandem ever. The Iron Horse had 13 consecutive seasons with both 100 runs scored and 100 RBI; hit a record 23 grand slams ; and won the 1934 Triple Crown. His .361 batting average in seven World Series led the Yankees to six titles in 13 years. A true gentlemen and a tragic figure, Gehrig's consecutive game streak ended at 2,130 when he was felled by a disease that later carried his name. Lou Gehrig was inducted to the National Baseball Hall of Fame in 1939.
