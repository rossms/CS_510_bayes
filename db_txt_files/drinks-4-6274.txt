While some may find it a little too sweet, I think the flavor is pretty good. The flavor is preserved by the glass bottle, and being a 'Jones' drink, it has a unique package and taste. Compared to the other Jones drinks (like Green Apple Soda, which everyone either loves or hates), Strawberry Lime is a nice, familiar flavor. I find it's best if you stick it in the freezer until the bottle ices over, but not so much that ice forms in teh drink. A nice change of pace from the normal sodas.
