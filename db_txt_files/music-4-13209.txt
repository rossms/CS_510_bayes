Once again, Dr. Dre returns after a 7 year hiatus to bring a musically captivating album featuring many notable (and not so notable) MC's. While the music is terrific, the subject matter is your stereotypical gangster fodder, complete with obligatory references to drugs, bitches, and lo-lo's. Aside from this dubious lyrical content, the Chronic 2001 is excellent.
