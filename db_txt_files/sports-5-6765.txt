The most underrated coach in the game!!! Everyone thought that Stockton and Malone carried this team, but actually it was the basketball knowledge, leadership, and overall coaching ability of Jerry Sloan. The fact that the Jazz are above .500 with names like Arroyo, Lopez, Kirilenko, Bell, and Stevenson prove this point. Never won Coach of the Year award but should have about 3 right now with his best job coming this year.
