The research triangle is nice, but everything eles in NC pretty much sucks. It has the highest number of KKK members in the US and the unemployment rate is through the roof. It's very hard to make friends because most of the people are not friendly to you when they know you're not a native. It's also really hot, but I'm originally from Florida so I was used to it. Just remember to dress light in the summer.
