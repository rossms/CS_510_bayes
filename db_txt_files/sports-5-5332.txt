In my opinoin, Kirk Hinrich is one of the best ballers to ever play in the NCAA. He knows how to pass well, shoot 3s he has the ability to defend against the dribble. He's got great offense ability as well as defense. Overall he is a great player with his experience knowledge of the game..great player to watch on the court. He's pretty nice to look at. =P PS. I wonder which team will he'll end up on. #8 pick..most likely.
