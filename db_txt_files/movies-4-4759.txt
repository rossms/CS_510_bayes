A cute movie. the plot is okay about a boy who is starting to doubt Santa Claus. A magical train pulls up on Christmas eve. and takes him on an adventure ride to the North pole where Santa is. we saw it at an IMax theater which is the way to go. it is in 3D and it is pretty neat to feel like you are in the movie. We liked the movie. it is a sweet. story although we would not have gone if it were not for seeing it at the Imax theater.
