Rolling Rock used to be one of my favorite beers in college. I think a lot of it had to do with the green bottles and I liked everything green back then. I was also drinking to get wasted and not to enjoy my beer. It served its purpose. I sometimes get Rolling Rock just because I want to see if I still like it and I don't. I have to give it a big hard swallow just to get it down. It has a funny bitter but sour taste that makes me get bitter face. I hate that. It just isn't that good to me anymore.
