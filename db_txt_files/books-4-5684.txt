a nice little book with poetry written by an amazing boy. He Mattie shares his poetry with the world he has composed since he was three. I think this book goes up to about age 11. for a kid he has some wonderful talent as a poet that is sometimes beyond his years. I have seen him on talk shows. He has a form of muscular dystrophy and has fought for his life since a toddler. I am impressed by his positive outlook on life, in spite of the obstacles he has faced.
