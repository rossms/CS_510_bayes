Just purchased a 1998 sienna LE and have no problems at all. Have 2 kids and a dog kennel and have more than adequate room. As far as sludge goes with regular maintainence no problems. And my toyota service advisor has let me know that the sludge problem is known to them and is covered under manufacturer warranty. Highly recommend the van.
