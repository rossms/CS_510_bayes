I know some people complain the album isn't COUNTRY...but I wanna ask you something, can you get over the fact that it's not a certain genre and look at it as a terrific album. I agree, it's not what I classify country is but it is one great album. Faith sings so beautifully and emotion is just pouring out of every song on the album. You can tell her heart is really in every song and she is pouring herself into every song. I would DEFINATELY go and buy this album, it is one of Faith's very best. She knows how to make a good record.
