Very enjoyable city from the few visits I have made to Savannah. I'm not sure what it would be like to live there. Negative: High crime in many sections of the city and very little to do outside of the city limits unless you're willing to drive a few hours. Positive: Great bars and restaurants, pretty nice beaches nearby, very friendly laid back folks (much moreso than in Fla.)
