This game is arcade pefect. The only reason I gave it a four was because it's almost impossible to play with a regular Dreamcast controller. The game does retain everything, secret characters and onslaught. It looks nice too. Two words for this game: Arcade Perfect. There's no skipping and you can switch fighters in a match.
