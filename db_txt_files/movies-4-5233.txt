Sometimes, the vision of the producer and the vision of the director don't really match too well. Sometime they do. In the case of Rebecca, the contributions of both Selznick and Hitchcock serve to benefit the film as a whole. I don't consider this to be a Hitchcock picture in the context of his techniques and methods. Rather, it is a film that he just happened to direct, like Rope of Spellbound. Rebecca is a case in which too many chefs combined to make something fantastic. Although not the best film, it is enjoyable and warrants praise.
