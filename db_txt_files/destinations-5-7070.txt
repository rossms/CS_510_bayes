Barcelona is my second favorite city in Europe, right after Prague. First of all, the women are absolutely beautiful, so even something as simple as sitting on a bench in the park is an enjoyable activity. The prices are relatively reasonable for Western Europe, and there is a lot to see and do. I especially enjoyed the Picasso Museum - it blew me away to see how talented that guy was even as a young teenager.
