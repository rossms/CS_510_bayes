I have the utmost respect for this man. I hope that he runs for president in 2004--I will not only vote for him, but will campaign for him. But for now he's busy trying to clean up the crap that was left from the Wilson regime and is taking alot of the heat for it. He has a long history of service to our country (I think he was a Captain in Viet Nam) and to the State of California, starting with the work he did during Brown's administration. He is pro-environment. He is very calm acting and is not a reactionary. I would trust him with the leadership of our country.
