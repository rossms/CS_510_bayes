I'm going to give Lucky Strike a 4 even though I'm not a smoker simply because they're cool and if I were to smoke you can bet I'd smoke Lucky's. There is just such a feeling of nostalgia associated with Lucky Strike that you don't have with any other cigarette. Lucky's are in all the old movies, it's hard not to see them as part of the whole WWII era. The pinup girls in their old ads were in the same style as the girls painted on the nose cones of WWII bombers. Yeah, I'd say Lucky Strike has style.
