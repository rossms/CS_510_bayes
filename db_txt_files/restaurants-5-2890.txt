I never tried Ben and Jerry's icecream until a couple of years ago when my friend and I bought some at the grocery store. They have an incredible variety of flavors, and each flavor is unique and tastes like what the label actually says. I've never felt ripped off that they don't put enough in my icecream to get the true flavor out of it. With all of the flavors out there, there is a flavor for everyone. It is a little expensive, but good for what it's worth!
