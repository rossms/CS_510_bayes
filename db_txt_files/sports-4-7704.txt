College career = phenomenal... unfortunately, a lot of folks don't remember just how good Walton was in the NBA when he was healthy. He was the best passing center in the game, one of the best rebounders and shot-blockers (led the league in both categories in '78) and an offensive threat. Walton had some serious hops and could dunk with the best of the big men in his day. A total team player who played with a fire not seen amongst today's centers. Let's not forget that he was league MVP in '78 when the voting was conducted by his fellow players in the NBA and led Portand to its only title in '77.
