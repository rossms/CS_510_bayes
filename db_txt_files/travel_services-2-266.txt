Over the last couple of years, several business trips with AA to the East Coast and one to Frankfurt. I remember one nice perk, More Room Throughout Coach extra legroom on their many 767s. That really made a difference comfort-wise, especially to Europe. Unfortunately they're getting RID OF IT! Which leaves us with a mediocre, bloated airline with shabby planes and hubs (ORD, DFW) more crowded and dirty than the norm - they look like Greyhound terminals. And when you get delayed, that matters. AA sucks.
