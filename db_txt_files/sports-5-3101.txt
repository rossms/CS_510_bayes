The commitment to excellence Cobb so masterfully displayed on the diamond should forever be revered in history as truly the best. It as a tragedy that this great and generous man is to this day still regarded as evil by the liberal minded media and the uneducated on the subject. As long as there is a little leaguer lacing up his cleats for the first time, with a desire to be better than the rest, Mr. Cobb will always remain the best there ever was.
