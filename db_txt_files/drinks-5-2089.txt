The Arizona Lemon Tea that you get in the can is in small plastic cups with foil cover. I just bought it for the first time and the tea powder or mix is a solid rock. You can eventually dissolve it, but it takes a long time. Otherwise you have little solids floating in your tea! But once it is dissolved, it is the best I've tasted!
