Wow, I'd be interested to read this again. If I remember right it was about different aged kids coping on their own, taking shelter in an abandoned boxcar. I recall this as being one of the first (non-Suess) books that I ever read. There was something very romantic about the whole situation -- kinda like a more innocent Party of Five episode.
