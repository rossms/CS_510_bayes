This movie is really funny the first time you see it, but it's kind of dull after that. It's probably funnier to most people than the sequels because the characters' habits are amusing, and the audience is used to them by the second. Although it's not nearly as amusing on the second viewing, I still liked it. Austin and Dr. Evil are both funny characters, and Mike Meyers does a great job playing both.
