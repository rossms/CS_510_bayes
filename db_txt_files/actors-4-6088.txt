Wesley Snipes is a talented actor who has really never given a bad performance. Who can forget his role in Major League ? He was great in Blade and its sequel, and I'm looking forward to seeing him in Blade III . He was great as the cop with a bad attitude in Passenger 57 , and as the framed man on the run in U.S. Marshals . Let's not forget his role as the inquisitive detective in Murder at 1600 . Down in the Delta and White Men Can't Jump were both great performances by this very talented actor.
