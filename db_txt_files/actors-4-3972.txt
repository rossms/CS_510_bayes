not quite five star level yet but almost there. played the role of amon goth so well in schindlers list that its hard to not stil see him as goth while playing other completely different roles. his van doran role in quiz show was really great as well. forget hannibal lecter this guy in my opinion played the scariest villain of all time on the big screen(and true life one at that)on schlindlers list. look forward to seeing him in other diverse films. think he would be great playing a younger grand moff tarkin in star wars episode 3
