Alright the last time I reviewed this I guess I was feeling bitter or something. But I have to admit, for a fun and sexy roller-coaster ride through hollywood dreamland this movie provides a good escape. I think maybe my only complaint would be drew barrymore's issues with the whole father thing, though barrymore and her character in general from the acting to the stunting I felt fell short compared to Liu's straight-faced sexiness and Diaz's lovable goofiness.
