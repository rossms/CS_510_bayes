The kids loved the movie and have seen it several times. As parents, its best to have seen The Great Escape to get the full understanding and humor of the why and how they created different characters. It was a good solid movie. A lot of respect has to be given for the pure craft and artistry it took to make the movie. If you can, rent it on DVD. This has some excellent behind the scenes and how they made movie information.
