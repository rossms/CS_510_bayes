Driver is one of the best driving games on any console. With great graphics and gameplay, Driver lets you be the getaway car in very intense car chases with the police. There are only two game flaws. The first is that the missions in the adventure mode gets repetitive after a while. Second, is the fact that it is a one player game. The game would be more exciting if you could play with a friend.
