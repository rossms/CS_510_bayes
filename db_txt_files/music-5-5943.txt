They try hard, but I really don't know if they'll ever get perfection. I think if you asked them, they would probably say that their collective reasoning and collaboration are from years of hard work and studying a variety of sounds- lyrically, they matched intellectual satire with the sounds of evolving rock/metal. Great Album- probably more surprises in the future!
