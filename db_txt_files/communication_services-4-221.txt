Air Touch and Verizon merged, so I now have Verizon. I prefer Air Touch to Verizon, even though I still get terrific reception. I am wishing they had good deals like no long distance for three local area codes like PacBell (even though PacBell gets horrible reception, I can't talk on a PacBell phone indoors).
