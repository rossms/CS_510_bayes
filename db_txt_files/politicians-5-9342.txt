Gotta give props to a guy whose first name is Chester. If you've ever seen a portrait of Chet, he's got some SERIOUS sideburns. As our illustrious 21st president, Arthur did much to abrogate the spoils system and give political jobs to people based upon merit. Gotta love that. Sorta like Cleveland in that respect. There are rumors that maintain Chet was actually born in Canada, although official records say he was born in Fairfield, Vermont. Chester Arthur---a guy with two first names. I think I'll try to convince my wife to name our firstborn Chester. GIVE IT UP FOR THE CHETMEISTER!!!! WHOO!!!!!
