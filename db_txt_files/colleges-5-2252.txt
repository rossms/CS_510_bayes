Beautiful campus, accessible professors, and friendly people who have school spirit. The only drawbacks are that the school itself is isolated, and that Virginians especially want to go to William and Mary or Virginia over Richmond because of the price tag, but it is worth it if you like a challenging environment in a cozy setting.
