This is a GREAT band,but enough already with repackaging stuff that every loyal fan has had already for years! There is NO improvement of sound quality- you might as well go out and buy the ORIGINAL recordings if you don't have them yet-at least then you get all the groovy stuff that never made it to the airwaves!(which,by the way,is far superior to the few new songs they toss in to make you buy this ripoff.)
