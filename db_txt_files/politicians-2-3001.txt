Jesse The Mouth Ventura needs to understand the difference between being on TV and being a leader. If Minnestoans re-elect this nitwit, I'll never live anywhere that cold, for fear of my brain freezing, as theirs have. Ventura is free to have as many stupid ideas as his wrestling-traumatized brain can handle. After all, under Hillary's careful guidance (c'mon children, Hillary knows best for you...), we considered socialized medicine. But why in the world is he a governor, where he has a platform? Better to say nothing and have people consider you a fool, than to open it and remove all doubt... !!
