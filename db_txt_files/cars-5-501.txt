I can only compare it to the bikes I have owned and ridden and it is better than any of the others including a silverwing (although this was not in the same class), a Yamaha Venture Royale and a Goldwing. This is THE ultimate sport touring machine and I would not trade it for anything else. Even if I do only weigh 170 lbs and have had polio in my right leg.
