This place is the best city or location in the United States. Although the city is known for government and politics (and rightfully so), one can arrive at 2 am on a Tuesday and find something exciting to do. Although northern Virginia has its share of yuppies, it is aesthetically gorgeous. Trying to avoid generalizations, the people of suburban Maryland seem to have an urbane, yet middle-class and down to earth demeanor. I've never visited a better place, hopefully I'll never live in abetter one.
