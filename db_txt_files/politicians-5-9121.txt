O.K...I KNEW I WOULD FEEL BAD WHEN PRESIDENT CLINTON LEFT, BUT AS I WATCHED THE PARADE THE OTHER DAY WITH ALL THOSE NASTY SIGNS ABOUT GEORGE W. ALONG THE PARADE ROUTE, I KNEW WE WERE IN BIG TROUBLE!! it is like a black cloud has rolled in over D.C....and when he actually opened his mouth to speak, and i looked into those eyes with that deer caught in a headlight look, my heart sank. The man has the intelligence and charisma of a doorknob. say what you will, president clinton was never boring, he did a heck of a job and Id vote for him in a second if i could!! Its going to be a lonnnnnng 4 years......
