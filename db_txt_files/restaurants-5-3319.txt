Oh man do I miss Papa John's. There aren't any here in San Francisco, so I have a tough time getting my Papa John's fix these days. Here's an example of how much I like this pizza: before driving up to Lake Tahoe this past weekend, I went to the Papa John's Web site and found one in a town on the way, then I drove 30 minutes out of my way to pick up an extra large pepperoni. Stupid? Sure. Worth it? Absolutely. One word of warning: a couple years ago I ordered a Papa John's special with every kind of meat on it, ate until I felt ill, and almost had a heart attack.
