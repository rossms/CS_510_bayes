I have owned both style Rav4s a 1998 and now a 2001 limited. They have done a fine job redesinging the new Rav4 has more room, more h.p. I am averaging 26 m.p.g. For people who think it is underpowered, I can tell you this it went head-to-head recently with a V6 Santa Fe and beat by two car lengths and in the slalom. Its great looking and turns a lot of heads. And don't forget the best part the warranty, 3yr/36k-bumpertobumper,5yr/60k powertrain,5yr/unlimited rust through also don't forget Toyota's quality, dependability, and reliability.
