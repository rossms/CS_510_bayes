Every now and then Mountain dew can be really tasty. But it has to be very very cold, and even then it isn't always great. I will never understand the need for this drink in the public eye. It must be the caffeine content. But like I said, it is good on a really hot day if it is ice cold. I just wouldn't drink it all the time.
