The best fighting game since Street Fighter 2. The DC version is legendary for it's time but this is just better-not a whole lot but a little. They didn't change much of the fighting system or style but tweaked some things, improved the graphics and added new characters and unlockable things making it better. "A tale of souls and swords told eternally, trancending history and time."
