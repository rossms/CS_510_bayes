I wouldn't put him with the heavy metal/hard rock albums. He's part of the original Punk age. That's PUNK, not New Wave [which I also loved, but, I pretty much like everything...still one doesn't really call a Folk singer a Country singer, no matter the similarities]. Though, IMO, Billy Idol, and this CD is more Hard Rock/Punk. And, is worth a listen, if not buying! Rua
