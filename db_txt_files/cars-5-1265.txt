My 2001 Avalon is an absolute jewel! The motor is so quiet that I sometimes check the engine to see if it's on. The back seat fits three adults comfortably. I'm about 5 feet tall and I love the electronic settings. No more car seats for me. I haven't had any car trouble whatsoever. The only complaint I have is the wheel and steering column locks if the wheels aren't straight when parking.
