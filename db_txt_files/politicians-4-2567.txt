I preferred him to Bush in 2000 and would likely do so again, even though I don't agree with his signature initiatives. I like politicians who don't always follow the party line and freely speak their minds. I like Zell Miller for the same reasons. With McCain, you also have a guy who served in Vietnam and spent five years in a Vietnamese Prison. Even though I didn't like his Campaign Reform bill, I appreciate his service to the country and would proudly vote for him for President if he were to run.
