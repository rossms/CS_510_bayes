I had gone on a camping trip this summer, 2005, and wanted to bring some drinks for later that night. I had come across Twisted Tea, flavor Half & Half, and from then on that is all that I drink. I am not a beer drinker but love the flavor of iced tea. I have found a local bar that sells Twisted Tea but only the full tea flavor, which is just as good. I have not been able to find many other bars in my area that sell Twisted Tea. But I tell you that if I could they would make a killing between my sister in-law and myself. Thank you Twisted Tea, your the best!!!
