No flash, but generally reliable. Overall, I am quite happy dealing with Saturn dealser. I did hit the 3 characteristic problems over the course of my 110K miles so far: Replaced 3 alternators, 1 fuel pump and 1 belt tensioner. Saturn alternators now come with a 36K warranty from the dealer, which is good since in my experience they only last between 30-35K miles.
