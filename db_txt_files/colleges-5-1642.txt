Tulane is a wonderful school! New Orleans is so beautiful and interesting. Mardi Gras is amazing! The classes are challenging, professors get to know you and by the time you graduate you will count them among your friends. I graduated a year ago and still keep in touch with my profs. The name is well respected and it's a great feeder school to top grad programs.
