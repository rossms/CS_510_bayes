First off, his name is spelled Allan. He is more athletic than Redick and a much better defender than just about any other 2 guard. Was the defensive stopper and go to 2 guard on this summers US team. Outshined Redick w/ out question on that team in regards to defense, offense (shooting), and hustle. Did have a bad post season last year, but a 3 game slump happend to even MJ. Best shooter in the big east (McNamara way overrated) possibly the nation.
