My husband and I took a motorcycle tour from Kathmandu to Lhasa. The journey was really rough (everyone, except I, got sick either from the altitude or from the food/water), but well worth it; it was truly a test of character. Lhasa was definite the nicest city in Tibet. There was a lot to do (shop, sightsee) and the food was really good compared to evertwhere else we had been (with the exception of Kathmandu). I would strongly recommend visiting this part of the world to anyone who is up for the challenge. This was an adventure, not a vacation .
