Boys: Wilt was thee greatest basketball player to ever lace on running shoes. If Jordan had to play against Russell, Jordan may not even be in the top ten all-time. Most 50 point games - Wilt 130 Jordan around 30. You cannot compare these two with how their teams did, as one or two of you are trying to do. Give your heads a shake guys, Chamberlain is the best to ever play the game. If you don't agree, you are wrong.
