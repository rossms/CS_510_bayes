I love 80's music. It's totally senseless and cheesy, and completely unaplogetic about it. Take On Me by itself is a good song but the video is a classic. Its special effects wowed people at the time but are kinda' lame now, to a lot of people. I think it's still cool, though. Also, the band is really cute.
