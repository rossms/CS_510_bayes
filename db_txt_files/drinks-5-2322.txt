Definitely an acquired taste. I started drinking it, because my discount club (Costco) didn't carry any other brand of carbonated water. After about the first case, I really started liking it. It's one of the few things I enjoy drinking with salad. Even though I was buying it at discounted prices, it was still something like $0.60 per bottle. A bit much, but not as bad as the bottled teas I drink.
