I love Jacksonville I visit recently and fell in love with the place. I thought it was going to be a boring city with ugly women. Then I get there and seen some fine sexy women I was sprung and the people are way nicer than where I live Los Angeles Ca. So I have found a new city also the city avoids hurricanes the last hurricane to hit jacksonville was hurricane dora in 1964 and it was a category 2.
