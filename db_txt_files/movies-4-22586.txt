was an amazing movie.. was gr8 to c arnie back.. effects were cool...i liked it i dont care what other guys say.. the chase scene in the small city was amazing.. the plot was amazin.. the ending was kinda expected but nevertheless it was still good.. u know at the end of the movie they always say something like in the first two his mom says something ...the thing he said right at the end was the best out of all of the terminator saga.. i just hope they have more instalments of this movie
