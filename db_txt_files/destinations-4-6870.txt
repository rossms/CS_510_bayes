I saw the Tide Roll against Mississippi State back in '01. The campus of The University of Alabama was very nice. The architecture was similiar to what you might see at Ivy League schools, unlike the University of Tennessee. Birmingham was surprisingly good. We drove around part of the suburbs, and they could pass for the high end suburbs of Philadelphia or New York. Will return someday, maybe to see Auburn University.
