It is a fact (look it up), we sell more merchandise than any sports team pro or college, besides the Yankees and Cowboys. That means we have more fans than everybody else. And that means we rule. We have the best recruiting class for '05 - '06, and if Bynum commits tomorrow, we probably have the best class of all time. In other words, I hope you haters had fun while it lasted. Like a dagger in your hearts, ain't it? Duhrrrrr, I thought Carolina was through. Get logical, doormats.
