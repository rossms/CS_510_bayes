I visited once and did not want to come home. Granted, it was in the summer so had I visited in the dead of winter, Vermont could have earned a lower rating. But the people were so friendly, and a sparse population, which means ZERO traffic woes. I believe it is the least populated state in the Union--I will be going back one day.
