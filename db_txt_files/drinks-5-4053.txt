A friend offered me a shot of this stuff over the Christmas hoidays. I didn't know what to expect and I quickly downed it without a chaser. YEEEHAAAW! I ran to the sink and started sucking down water from the spigot. This is the most potent stuff I ever tasted. A liquor that has an anti-flame screen on the bottletop is one that must be reckoned with. Why anyone would do shots of this is beyond me. Masochists, maybe? Do NOT drink this without a spotter.
