I have always had a soft spot for Kevin, ever since I saw the a public broadcast for aids prevention. He had a short paragraph to say, and he made me believe it all. After that I tried to see everything that I could find and ended up being the biggest Hercules fan that I know of. I think I taped every episode and watched over and over and over. Andromeda is all right, but I guess I have Kevin type-cast in my head. Keep working hard Kevin.
