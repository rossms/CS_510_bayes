Nacho Doritos taste great, plain and simple. I'm willing to overlook their garish color, the fact that they give you terrible breath and orange fingers, and their unhealthy ingredients for that reason. The addition of enhanced nacho flavoring was a smart move. I used to dig through the bag looking for chips with the most flavoring, and now they're all pretty well-coated. I don't buy Doritos very often, but I sure enjoy them when I do.
