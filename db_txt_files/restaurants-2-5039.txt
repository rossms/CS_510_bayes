Pro's: 1. Decently priced for what you get. 2. Good Soup, Salad Breadsticks. Con's: 1. Other than a few staples, can be hard to find the same selction twice. 2. In no way to be confused with authentic Italian food. 3. Waitstaff has notable tendency to be slow, overly familiar pushy. So, overall 2 Stars.
