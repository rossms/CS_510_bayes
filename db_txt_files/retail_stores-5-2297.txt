First off let me tell riccotma that you were very stupid to move to the south, i did a while ago, THEY HAVE NO WEGMANS! And because of many other reasons, i have decided to move back to new york, anyways, its a great store and its headquarters is in my town (Rochester NY) My aunt manages one of the first wegmans that opened. They have lots of samples and the food is really good. LOL in north crapolina, they have this store called Food Lion, the hick assiest excuse for a store ever invented, it is like a gas station with no gas!
