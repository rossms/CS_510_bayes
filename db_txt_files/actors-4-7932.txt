I like Jason Biggs. He's got a goofy, harmless, good-guy quality that makes him perfect for the roles he's played so far. It's hard not to root for his character to end up with the hot woman at the end of the movie. Plus you have to give Biggs some kind of credit (I'm not sure exactly what kind) for having sex with an apple pie on the big screen. I heard him interviewed on Howard Stern, and even in real life he played up the whole I'm the good-natured and likeable loser who never gets the girl thing. It remains to be seen if he'll be typecast in that role for the rest of his career.
