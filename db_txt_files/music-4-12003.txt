This album is the female anthem. Destiny's Child represented for the modern woman on this album. I love how the lead singer sings her heart out on Amazing Grace . My favorite song is BugA-Boo . I once had a friend that liked me so much he became a bug-a-boo. I had to immediately turn my cell phone off.
