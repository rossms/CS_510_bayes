 God Bless Georgia! It's the home of the greatest band in the world, REM. Athens GA is a great city aside from the fact that Michael Stipe and Mike Mills still live there. The city still boast a superb music scene with the E-6 bands and Vic Chesnutt among others. Also 5 points in Atlanta is a great place to be. If you like strip joints there's plenty in Atlanta. And Macon is the home of the Allman Brothers. Whoo! What a state. And also the site of the omce great Georgia Championship Wrestling! The only bad thing about the state is the Braves. Go Phillies!!
