France has it all. Paris is one of the most magnificent cities in the world and the French Riviera is gorgeous. Additionally, some of the greatest wines get their names from regions/cities in France. Plus, I didn't find the people as obnoxious as their stereotype suggests. Don't be surprised, however, if there are labor strikes while you are there. It is not at all unusual for the rail system or museums to be shut down due to dissatified striking workers.
