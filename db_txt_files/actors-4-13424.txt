Always liked Juliette Lewis. Developing in so many ways (especially putting a little more meat on the frame), she deserves better than TV guest-spots and surprise slots in the occasional movie. Can't seem to get past the ditzy label of some of her previous roles. As I've always said, a good script can overcome most obstacles, and here's a lady who could use on sooner rather than later.
