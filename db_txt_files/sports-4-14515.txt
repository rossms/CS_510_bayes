Well he was something. Football, baseball, Olympics etc. - who could do that now? Who else did it then? The coolest thing I heard about his football days was that back in his days you could still tackle a player by tripping him. Jim has these long oak trees for legs and could run like the wind, the trip was his tackle of choice. And he didn't pull any stick your leg out Three Stooges crap, apparently he ran up and plain kicked the legs from underneath people. Hard.
