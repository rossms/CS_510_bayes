America is still a good country to live in. We still have freedom of religion, freedom of speech, freedom of press, and other rights. Howver, we have our many problems, including the highest crime and murder rate in the world, the highest teenage pregnancy rate in the world, a real serious drug problem, and irresponsible politicians who do know know how to solve problems. Still, America is a great country.
