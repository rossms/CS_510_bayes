His skills are not the best and he is allergic to making free throws. But O'Neal is a force in basketball few have equalled. His presence on the court alters not only how a team plays defense but how they run their offense. Very few players of any skill level can claim that. Very impressive and Bryant will not win a title without O'Neal.
