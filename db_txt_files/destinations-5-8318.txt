I know that Disneyland and Magic Mountain are tourist favorites, but for my money Knott's is best. I'm fifty years old and have been going to Knott's since I was a kid. My kids loved it and now they are taking my grandkids. I love the BBQ and Fried chicken dinners. The old west and Native American exhibition are my favorites.
