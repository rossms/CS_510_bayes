Fishy? Come on, Poland Spring is like liquid gold. The best. I have a Poland Spring cooler at home and absolutely love it. The delivery service is reliable, affordable, and friendly, often going out of its way to replenish my supply even when I'm not quite due. Supposedly Maine is considering putting a tax on its natural water supply. I'm hoping it won't drive up prices...
