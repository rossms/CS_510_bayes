After reading all these comments, boy do we feel lucky to have dodged this bullet!!! We just had an accident in our 95 Windstar which has been declared a total loss. I was crying until I read all these horror stories. We had been having some leakage that someone (another 95 owner) told us was the beginning of the head gasket problem. Needless to say, we will not be buying another Ford or American product, we will take our insurance money and RUN, RUN, RUN, to the nearest foreign dealer!!!
