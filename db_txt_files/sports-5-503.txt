Hands down the greatest hitting catcher of all time. Underrated defensive catcher in all aspects except throwing out would be basestealers (in which he is abysmal). Nobody hits the ball harder. Amazing power to the opposite field. Career .319 average as a catcher speaks for itself. Didn't always have the greatest of protection behind him and still owns the all-time home run record for a catcher while playing home games in noted tough pitchers parks (Dodger and Shea Stadium). When he's at the plate you have to stop and watch.
