San Diego may have some great landscapes, but the cost of living is way too high. It is not as ethnically diverse as many other major U.S. cities. And being of an ethnic minority, I can say the attitudes of the people reflect that fact, especially in the beach areas which everyone talks about (i.e. Pacific Beach, Ocean Beach, La Jolla).
