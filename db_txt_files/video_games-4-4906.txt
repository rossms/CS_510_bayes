I had all of the PS1 Tony Hawk's, then bought an x-box. THPS2 is the ORIGINAL video game to me because it is the first one I mastered, so of course I HAD to get it for XBOX! It was a nice surprise when the $20 game arrived that it had 3 new levels and all of THPS1 levels....one less game I had to buy! Absolutely worth the money
