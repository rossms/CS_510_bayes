The Beatles were at their best when they were offbeat and experimental and at their worst on the poppier radio-friendly numbers, which dominate this compilation. It's a poor representation of what they did. I dont agree with people who write them off wholesale just because they are 'old'. That's a bit pathetic. Nor do I think the sun shines out of their collective backsides. To hear the Beatles at their best check out 'The White Album' and 'Magical Mystery Tour'.
