I discovered this young lady on a PAX program called America's Most Talented Kids, a televised talent contest showcasing the artistic abilities of young people aged 6 through 15. They have three judges, all youths themselves, and Scarlett is one of them. It is on this show that I got the urge a few months ago to check out Reba (in which Scarlett stars as her daughter), which really isn't as bad a show as I thought it would be. Scarlett delivers a pretty good performance. I'm not that familiar with too many of the newer child actors, but Miss Pomers is one of few who seem to stand out.
