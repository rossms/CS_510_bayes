Ron Zook is getting a lot better. As many have mentioned, people have expected way too much out of him in his first two years. He is regrouping the team and with Leak, Fason, and some of the other outstanding newcomers (who have some valuable experience now) the Gators have the chance to reclaim their 90s SEC glory. The Gators may not have historically dominated the SEC but 12 years of past glory and the stars of the present look to reveal that in the next years it will be great to be a Florida Gator.
