Pretty good movie. Reese Witherspoon plays a college student who gets dumped by her snobby boyfriend.He wants to go to Harvard and study law.She finds a way to enter Harvard so she can follow her ex and get him back. Elle is kind of a fluff and at first does not fit in with the stuck up intellectuals at Harvard but surprises herself and others by actually succeeding at Harvard.If you are willing to just go with the movie and not question the probabilities of the movie this is okay. Reese Witherspoon does a decent job as Elle. Not a great movie but good enough.
