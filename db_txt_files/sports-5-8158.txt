If you peep the name you would understand why I would rate hin one on the league's premier players. No, he's not the greatest but please believe that there aren't too many people that can stop him. (It takes a whole team to do that!) At least he's not out there trying to compete with his teammates over who should be the star like some other stars(Kobe). Anyway, I think in the years to come my future husband can only do better. He is after all from UNC and the Human Highlight reel for the NBA!!!! The Man is truly InVinceAble!!!
