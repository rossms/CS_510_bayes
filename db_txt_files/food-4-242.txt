Very good but not the best. What Frosted Flakes has going for it is that you can eat it everyday (or just about) and actually fool yourself into thinking it's not just your typical junk cereal, it just isn't as junky as others. However, if you're going to eat sugared cereals why not go all the way and it the ones that barely resemble something that could have been grown.
