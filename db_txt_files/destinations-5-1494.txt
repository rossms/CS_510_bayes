What a great place to visit and hopefully one day a great place for me to live part of each year. Beautiful scenery, great people, so many things to do and great food and drink make Costa Rica one of the best places to get away to for any length of time. The flight is not long from most parts of the US and is fairly reasonable in price if you book your trip early. Cerveza Imperial, monkies runnning wild and surfing are 3 great reasons to visit this beautiful country.
