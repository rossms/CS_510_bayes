Miami plays great ball and wins a lot of big games, but why don't they have more fan support? Why is their stadium never full? If nearly 30,000 Alabama fans went all they way to Los Angeles for their season opener against UCLA (and look at how bad Alabama was last season) why don't the far more numerous and affluent residents of south Florida show that kind of support for Miami? Does anyone have an explanation for this?
