I am not into games anymore, but enjoy playing the grey old box sometimes. I like hearing the theme song of the original Super Mario Bros. Hearing that song brings back great memories. I have two good as new NES systems since i replaced the 72 pin connectors in both of them. They dont blink anymore! Tecmo Bowl forever!
