What I could see provided first class views of really awesome scenics. However, don't arrive late in the day on a schedule. You will not be able to see the interior much because you will miss the shuttle schedule which closes early and if you are not staying in the park you miss part of it, some say the best part. For this reason it gets only a 4.
