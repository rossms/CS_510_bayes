my parents had a 1990 or so gallant and only after the 10 year mark did it start giving us any lip a quiet obediant car for less than a honda or camry. but nowadays, mitsubishi is targeted towards themid life crisis section of the market where sporty lookers and luxury hookers are the ticket to sucess. (?) they are a lot more expensive than their rivals, camry or Accord, but they have got the attitude! good luck to mitsubishi and i wish their company the best of luck making their cars a little more reliable... (ps my dad works for Mitsubishi)
