This video is the first from Janet's new album All For You , well actually the second as Doesn't Really Matter is also included in her new album. The All For You video is fun and sexy and the dance moves show that Janet can beat Britney at her own game. I love the song and the video is just the icing on the cake! Janet fans everywhere now have a another reason to celebrate.
