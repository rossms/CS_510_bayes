Not really a tradtional roadster like the Miata or MR2, but a convertible race car. I love everything about it except the digital dash. Would prefer analog gauges. The 2002 model has a glass back window and a better stereo. Still too expensive, but fewer dealers are gouging now. The S2000 is probably intended to have a limited run, so if you want one, act fast!
