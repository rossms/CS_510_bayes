I like to by clothes, I love shopping, but I'm not into wearing them more than two-three times. So I don't go for good quality and expensive buys, since they're going to hang in my closet most of the time. Their clothes go out of style fast, but by then I'm already thruogh wearing them. They have a nice prise on most of their stuff, and their sales are one of the things I'll never miss. And until anyone says anything, I'll keep on buying my clothes cheap on H M and wearing them new and then give 'em away a year later.
