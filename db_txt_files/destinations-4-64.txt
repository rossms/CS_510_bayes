This is an interesting city you can't denied. The thing is that this is going to be the biggest city of the world in the future, says the statistic! Anyway, if unexpected things happened, it'll become at least the second largest, just behind Tokyo. I haven't been in Africa yet, unfortunately, and I haven't heard much about Lagos either, but if you'll ask me if I WANT to go there, you woun't find a no in my mouth! :-)
