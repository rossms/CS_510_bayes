Woodford Reserve is definitley one of the best bourbons around. We went for a tour of their distillery the day after Thanksgiving 03. It is located in beautiful Kentucky horse country. The aroma of the barrel house is intoxicating. Please never mix anything but a splash of water or ice with a quality bourbon.
