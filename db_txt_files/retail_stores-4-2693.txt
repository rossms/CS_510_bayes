Your garden variety, basic grocery store. The larger, newer stores appear to have expanded their horizons over the years and now carry a decent selection of organic/healthy foods and some specialty items. I think I've even seen sushi in some of the upscale areas. Kroger can be counted on to be competitive in pricing, double coupon days, and some great two for one deals.
