I'd give him five stars if his list only consisted of The Fisher King, Dead Poets Society, Awakenings, Good Morning Vietnam World According To Garp. The reason I have to deduct a star is because when he's not really, really good...he really, really sucks! There doesn't seem to be any middle ground for him. Oh, he had a cool cameo in Joseph Conrad's The Secret Agent(with Bob Hoskins Patricia Arquette). Damn, I almost forgot...very competent in Good Will Hunting.
