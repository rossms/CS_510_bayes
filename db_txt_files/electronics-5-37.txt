My Sharp ViewCam is excellent. It is easy to use, with two different ways of viewing, and the quality is great. Anyone can use it and come out with great movies. I highly recommend it. My only complaint is the battery doesn't last as long as I would like it to...and there's an easy fix for that, if you are inside, use the plug and if you are out and about have an extra battery or two handy!
