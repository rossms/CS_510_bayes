Feb. 21 2005 We have been steady customers of the Fudd for many years and, have been enjoying every bite. That is until today !!! Today,for the Presidents' Day occasion, we made the Fuddrucker's at Annandale,Virginia, our lunch place. BUT !! I regret to tell you that even though the service was as good as before, the quality of the meat( BURGER) and the Portabella were absolutely BELOW the usual standard for the FUDD'S.Mark; 703 729-5027.
