This movie is very funny, I'm looking forward to seeing Meet the Fockers. I did think that this movie had some parts that were getting to the there is no way this would ever happen so for me it wasn't as funny as it could have been, if things could have been more realistic. But that didn't stop me or anyone else to sitting back and enjoying this true comedy of Robert De Niro and Ben Stiller.
