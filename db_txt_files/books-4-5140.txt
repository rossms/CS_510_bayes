This book was good, it did get me interested in feudal Japan, and I did breeze through it 1,000+ pages relatively quickly, but to call the best book, or even one of the best books ever written? Come on it is a little ridiculous at times, nad too much of a sappy love story. Although it is based very roughly on a true story.
