Aenima is probably Tool's best CD, although it isn't as progressive as Lateralus,Aenima explores progressive rock more than the previous release Undertow.It is definately one of Tool's darkest CDs and it open's ones mind to things such as evolution,genetic mutation,public desensititization and religious hypocracy.If you listen well you may be able to understand the message Tool is trying to get across and that is to open your third eye and realize the world around that you might have been blinded to.Aenima is an aggressive,intellectual and dark work of art.
