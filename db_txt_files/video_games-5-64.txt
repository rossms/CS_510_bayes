The ultimate 3D shooter. It's got everything, great weapons, arena's, varied locations, great powerups, terrific graphics, moody sounds, a brilliant control system, and there's so much room for mods and mutators that can alter the game either subtlely or completely. Brilliant stuff, and this from a guy who doesn't like many modern games. Roll on UT 2003!
