My experience at the McCombs School of Business at UT-Austin has been superb. An excellent reputation in the fields of finance/real estate and accounting, combined with a good reputation among recruiters (people here are getting good jobs and internships even in the tough economy), reasonable tuition, and fabulous Austin location, should put UT at the top of anyone's MBA short list. My only complaint comes from the fact that it is a large, state-supported school and as such, the red tape and bureaucracy can be maddening at times.
