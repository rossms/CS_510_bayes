A brilliant offensive mind and motivator. He has surrounded himself with great coaches, teachers and coordinators. Though never before a head coach, possibly because of his size, he was the Offensive Coord at Maryland under Ross when the Terps won 3 straight ACC titles; the Offensive Coord under Ross at GaTech when they won the national championship and the Offensive Coord under Ross with the San Diego Chargers when they went to the Super Bowl. His record as a winner is undeniable.
