Rhode Island is small, but has much to offer. Providence is a wonderful medium sized metro region. It has a great rebuilt downtown, lots of historical houses, great places to eat, and some famous colleges (Brown, Providence College) Art and culture abound. The Rhode Island coast has clean beaches and small New England villages. A really fun place to visit or live.
