They're a poor man's Abercrombie with better customer service. It is pretty hard not to see that A&E rips off Abercrombie's styles nowadays. A few years ago A&E was NOT vintage oriented and had more classic styles. I have a few nice, thick wool sweaters from that era, but now that quality is nowhere to be found. Sorry, but I'd rather pay more for A&F's higher-quality vintage clothes, even if the employees ignore me.
