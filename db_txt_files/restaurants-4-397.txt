Compared to the trascendent eating experience that is Chick-Fil-A, Wendy's is not quite close enough. However, their chicken fingers are delicious and their fries are pretty good as well. Their advertising campaign can't beat Eet Mor Chicken, but Mr. Wendy is still a bit funny. Internal designs are good--with bright colors and open windows--but are small compared to Chick-Fil-A (and severely lacking in reds). Their logo is fair and their packaging is about the same.
