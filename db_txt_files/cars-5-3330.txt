About the gasoline tank liner - I have a 1995 Jeep Grand and the fuel pump failed at 115,000 miles (May 2002). The dealer tried this microbial growth bs until I had some friends at Conoco put this line to rest. Nonetheless, $800 and a new fuel pump later, I was back on the road. This liner is crap - beware!!!
