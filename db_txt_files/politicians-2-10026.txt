His bumbling antics make him loveable. His foreign and domestic policies make him him detestable. If it weren't for his boyish appearance and comical mannerisms, He'd be a lot less popular. He's like the cute, spoiled kid that gets away with everything. I give him a 2, because he's not as bad as some of the other Republicans. What do I care though, I don't even live there.
