WOW! Took our teenagers here during spring break 2004. We were overwhelmed how amazing the canyon is. Try to stay right on the rim in the park, it is so wellworth it and a huge timesaver. Reservations are hard to get but keep checking for cancellations--We did (3 days before we arrived) and we ended up staying right on the rim at the Kachina Lodge. Don't miss the historic ElTovar Lodge lobby. The dining room there is very nice. The free shuttle to all the lookout points was great. The mules weren't being used while we were there--the trails were being repaired. Try to see sunrise or sunset!
