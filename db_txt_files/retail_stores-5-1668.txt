K-mart is an excellant store. Although they have been struggling recently, they are doing everything they can to improve their stores. When you walk into a K-mart you get a nice department store feel & smell like at the old Ames, Caldor, and Bradlees stores that don't exist anymore. I enjoy going to K-mart and I would rather go there than Target or Wal-mart anyday.
