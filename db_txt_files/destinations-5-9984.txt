these blow newports away, they arent harsh and dont cut up your throat like the newports. Id recomend going with the milds though because Full Flavor has too much mint and takes away from the taste of the tobbacco, its like one giant mint, but hey if thats what floats ur boat go ahead, I like the milds cause its the taste of mint AND tobbbacco. the lights are ok too but i need a stronger cig, drop your newports...trust me....these will blow you away..let me know what u think
