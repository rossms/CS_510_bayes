This version of TR is just ok, in spite of the fact that there are quad 4's to drive, dinasours to fight and lots of devastating new weapons like grenade launchers and bazookas. Gameplay could be better and you spend too long in certain levels. Not all the secrets work so the only way I could get the bonus level, was to download the marker from a tomb raider site. There are worse games out but they could have done better with this one
