This bike is a great choice for someone looking to get into riding with mainly a casual approach to the sport. I mainly use mine to get back and forth from work (street) but had other ideas in mind too; some lite off-roading (dirt) with some hill work and a trail off the beaten track once in a while. The Diamondback Response answers the call with a strong frame, ease of shifting and a general all-around performance that fills all my needs. Actually alot of bike for the hard earned $$$ spent.
