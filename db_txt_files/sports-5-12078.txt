I grew up an Auburn fan and have been a season ticket holder since '85. My mother and father taught Carnell. I can honestly say that Carnell is the best back that I have seen since Bo Jackson won the Heisman. He wants the Heisman and wants his degree so I have to give it to him for coming back his senior year.
