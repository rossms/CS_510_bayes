I have just finished my 8th class at the UOP and I love the online environment. It is challenging and fulfilling at the same time. The Professors and Instructors are great and so are the University's staff. The financial aid department needs a little bit of practice and clarification, but the whole school is fantastic in my opinion. I would recommend it to anyone who wants to complete a degree, but has little time. The University of Phoenix offers a quality and challenging education in a very accomodating environment.
