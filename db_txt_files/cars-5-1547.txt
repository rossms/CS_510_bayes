BIGBABY thinks he/she know everything about every car, but he/she doesnt. I own a Continental and a Land Rover Disc.(both of which he has rated poorly along w/ half of the other vehicles on this site). The Cont. is great car(22 mpg avg.) that i bought new in 2000 and have yet to have a problem except for a broken windshield wiper. I will admit that the Land Rover is a lemon. So, BIGBABY just cause you cant afford either one dont diss it if you dont know it(enjoy your ford focus).
