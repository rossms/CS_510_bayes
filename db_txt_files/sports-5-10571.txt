Great coach. Built KSU into a powerhouse with JUCO's every year. Does anybody know how tough it is to put winners together in one year with many Junior College Transfers? Light schedule helps but beats top teams too. Undefeated Oklahoma learned that in 2003 showing you Stoops is not as good as Synder. Stoops had far more talent but got blown away. Synder Rules!
