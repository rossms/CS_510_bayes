Great donuts, I can't eat just 12. If you ever wondered why the stores (not the kiosks in the gas stations, but the actual bakeries) are nowhere near suburban areas, its because Krispy Kreme marketing decided that the blue collar workers love their donuts more than the white collar workers do. I'm not a fan of the kiosks unless you can get them the minute they arrive, day old donuts just don't do that much for me. Fresh Krispy Kremes are worth the extra drive.
