I give Miami a four because they have a few players on their team that I used to play with. As a whole, the team is pretty good, and they have some good, young athletes from the Bay. So, it looks like the Bay Area is putting it down for the state of Florida. But seriously, if Miami focuses, they could really start beating a lot of these teams in their conference. I think they'll finish with a good record.
