Really nice state, but just like its Neighbor a couple states over, Maine, it is losing it's New England charm in many areas because of tourism and transplants, more than half of the people who live in Vermont now are newcomers from other states, so there isnt as much of a local feel as their used to be, the friendly New England people are now outnumberd by yuppie vacationers or hippies in many towns. But it is still very beautiful, so it has to get more than an average rating.
