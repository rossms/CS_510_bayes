I grew up (in the 90s mind you) with this tape. I think everyone loves S G and I can see no reason why not. As they went their separate ways, they each made their own mistakes. But these early hits tell of innocence, friendship, love--I hope that doesn't sound too mawkish, because it's entirely true. Minus a star only because they insisted on including the live version of For Emily (Whenever I May Find Her) rather than the studio version that I find to be much more moving. ...we walked on frosted fields of juniper and lamplight... Mmmmh.
