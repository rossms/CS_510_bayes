I think that the song has a great melody, but that's just my opinion. Vanessa is very talented in both singing and instrumental. I think her songs can relate to most people, even if it just relates a little. Ordinary Day is one of those songs where you feel caught up in a dream that seems so real and you wonder if it really had happened. Over all, I thought it was a great video.
