it is so fun! for kids and adults of all ages. the dumbo ride is well known for a fun ride for little children. teens will love many of the faster paced rides, adults alike. the park is huge...and there is animal kingdom(with different animals, like a zoo/safari), MGM(a great park, I HIGHLY recommend!), Epcot(learn about different cultures), waterparks, a 'race track park'(sorry, i don't know the actual name), etc. Also, visit Disney land in CA! It's smaller but great!! I must say, 4.50 is the HIGHEST rating! Everyone loves Mickey and Minnie!!
