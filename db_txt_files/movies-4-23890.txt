I am not a huge Sci-fi fan but I really got into this movie. This movie was very thought provoking. It makes you see the positives and negatives of genetic engineering. It also reminds you that it isn't far off in the future that we'll have the ability to choose what kind of child we want to have. Ethan Hawke and Uma Thurman do a great job in this film about what the future of genetic engineering could possibly have on our society.
