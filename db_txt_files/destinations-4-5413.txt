amazing, everyone likes to bash and trashtalk but lets' take a step back and look at ourselves and the states we all live in. Want me to bash NY? Cali? nope, I won't bash what makes this country it is, the People. Reflect what this Weekend was and if you don't like what this country has to offer then leave. Remember, NO ONE is perfect.
