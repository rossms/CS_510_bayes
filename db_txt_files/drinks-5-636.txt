Pacifico has become my favorite beer. There's something about a nice cold bottle of Pacifico, with moisture dripping down the side, and a wedge of lime jammed in that just makes for good drinking. It has a little more flavor than Corona, but is not quite as heavy as say a Bud. If you haven't tried this beer yet, get to the West Coast (or Mexico) and get yourself a 12 pack - you won't be sorry.
