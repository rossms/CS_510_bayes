I don't find Steve to be that great of a film maker. He did make a great film this past year, Traffic, which was held up only by the performances, not the directing which I found used up, borrowed and very dull. He also made the terrible Julia Robert's plug, Erin Brokovich. His style is blah, but his nak for finding very talented actors and great subjects and stories to direct makes up for his poor poo directing. Very over rated.
