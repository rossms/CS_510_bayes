Jamaica is one of the most fun, beautiful, exotic places I have ever seen. The people are so laid-back. Dunn' River Ralls is so much fun! Its just beautiful and fun to play it. If you're looking for other things to do in Ocho Rios, try going horseback riding in the ocean. Its unforgettable. There is also white water rafting which i have not personally been on, but my brother went. No matter how cheesy or lame or run-down something looks, it will still be a great experience. Most places look run down in Jamaica, but thats part of the island charm. Go there, it is unforgettable!!
