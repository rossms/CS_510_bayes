You can't go wrong with a combination of cinnamon and sugar. Cinnamon Toast Crunch is an ultra-sweet cereal, with a strong cinnamon flavor and quite a bit of sugar. I'd never eat it for breakfast, but it makes a great snack or dessert. Somewhere along the way, I think the amount of sugar sprinkled on top of the cereal was reduced- much to my dismay. However, it still packs a sugar punch, no doubt. Anyone who likes really sweet, crunchy food will love Cinnamon Toast Crunch.
