Before the last election I wrote, "I just wish he'd run with Kerry. He's a straight-shooting, decent, honest guy. I love him...and that comes from a liberal." Now that he through all of his support to the worst president this country has ever had the misery of experiencing, for crass political reasons, I think he's far less honorable than I'd first thought. I considered 1 star, but I still tend to think he's reasonably decent, but that he's a political animal like all the rest and does what works best for him, not necessarily for the country.
