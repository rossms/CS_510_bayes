I saw him in one movie - The Talented Mr. Ripley and he was excellent. He was alright in The 25th hour. I've heard he has talent and I've seen that he can alter his look to play the role given. I think this may be a talented guy who is one great movie away from being a big time star. Would'nt be surprsied if he won an Oscar.
