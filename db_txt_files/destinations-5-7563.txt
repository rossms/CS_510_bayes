The last time I was at Centennial Park was for the 1996 Olympics, when I was nine years old. It is really a beautiful place. I am really hoping that we soon catch Eric Rudolph for the horrible atrocity he commited---BOMBING Centennial Park! All of the lush greenery and wonderful sounds/smells that surround the park make it heaven for any nature lover. I'm hoping I have a chance to go back to CP. Five years after my first and last visit, I still remember the place like I was there yesterday. I hope CP is around for centuries to come! Take care, everyone!
