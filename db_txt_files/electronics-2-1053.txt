An old, useless phone with a limited number of features. The battery life is too short, and the voice quality is downright awful. The only good thing about it is that it's cheap and you won't be sorry to leave it in the taxi. Just look at the upcoming 2100: http://nokia.com/nokia/0,,4582,00.html even 3210 looks good compared to this!!!
