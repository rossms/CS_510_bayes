As far as brainpower is concerned, Jane has none. She did have the star-power, however. She was a near great actress. She has taken a lot of heat and rightfully so for her actions in Hanoi in the sixties. One thing to remember, however, my dear readers, in the RIA, the Viet Nam War was unconstitutional. Only Congress has the power to declare war. All the strict constructionists out there know of what I speak. The Kennedy-Johnson Administration and Congress did not have the cojones to declare war, and thus really make opposition a crime.
