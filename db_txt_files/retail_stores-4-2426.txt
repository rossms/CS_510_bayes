Whole Foods seems to have created an entirely new niche: upscale organic. I thought organic food markets were supposed to be cheaper and grungier? It's interesting to browse the aisles here and see stuff you wouldn't find in a typical organic market, like expensive wines and French cheeses. Still, I give them bonus points for having incredibly inviting stores.
