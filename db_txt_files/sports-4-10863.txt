Good coach with Pro experience and excellent recruiting classes. UVA is in a tough spot though. The ACC is ulta competitive and without talent or experience in key positions a team can and will stifle itself. Groh fields good teams but they still cant crack the upper echelon of College Football. UVA is an upper tier program that will probably always win 7-8 games yet come up short against the big boys, go to the Peach or Tire Bowl and produce some good pros. So be it.
