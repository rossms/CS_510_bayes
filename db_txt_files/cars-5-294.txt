I put 1,500 miles on a 2002 model last year and loved it all the way. The LeMond geometry works great for people with longer torsos/shorter legs (yours truly), but might not work well for others. Definitely try before you buy, and if it does not work for you then don't force the issue. Key features: Steel frame - feels great, will last until you are tired of the bike. You don't have to worry about fatigue cracks (like Al users do). Ultegra - the BA is one of the more affordable bikes on the market with a full Ultegra gruppo. Cool looking wheels - hey, I like them!
