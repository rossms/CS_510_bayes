For the most part, I can see why JetBlue gets as much respect as it does. They've got lots of onlys...only airline with live TV, all new aircraft, certain Internet booking features, flights between East Coast and Oakland/Long Beach, etc. I've never found them to have those annoying comedy club flight-attendants, but it seems like I always run into that on Southwest. No U.S. airline deserves 5 stars in my book, but these guys come as close as you can get.
