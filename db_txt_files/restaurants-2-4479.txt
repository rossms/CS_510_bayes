I am at a loss of why this place does such good business. I went to Outback for the second time in a year because the first visit was pleasant. Holy Cow, the portions have shrank and the prices have skyrocketed since the first visit. The $10 it cost for my Chicken on the Barbi (only came with a serving of vegetables) was outrageous. Save your money and go elsewhere.
