Barry Sanders is simply the best running back to ever set foot on the field. Not only did he not have an offensive line to run behind, most of the time he was in Detroit there wasn't much of a passing game either. Barry was the Lions, and the class act of the NFL. Never talked trash, never celebrated his individual accomplishments. No one has ever run like Barry and no one ever will.
