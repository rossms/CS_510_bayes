I don't care whether or not he got stuck in the bathtub. He was a great guy, if not the best prez. Friendly, great sense of humor, WHY IS HE AT THE BOTTOM OF THE LIST BEHIND THAT IDIOT RONALD REAGAN, even better Supreme court justice! HE would have justified last years' election, 'cause he was a good man unlike that smart-a** bigot Clarence Thomas!!! One of our best presidents, I'd say #5.
