this video made mtv change their rules for dial mtv because it was #1 for over 6 months, who knows how long it would have held the spot!! plus this song and video launched the power ballad genre. this song is great and the video is greater. long live the crue!! it still holds up today as a great video, 15 years later. no doubt it is the best!!
