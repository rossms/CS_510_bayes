Ohio is a great state! What makes it so wonderful is that it is filled with a little bit of everything. From modern buildings to historical sites; a hard working middle, some very wealthy individuals and families; from the extreme left (not much of the extreme left, Thank God), to the religious right. Ohio has both nice summers and picturesque winters. Ohio is a mixture of everything. It is impossible to sum up the state in only a few words. The Buckeye state has it all and I would not want to live anywhere else.
