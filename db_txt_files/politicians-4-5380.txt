Al Gore is not the most charasmatic politician but I beleive he is intelligent and has an understanding of politics. Everytime I see George W. Bush I get a sense he isnt sincere or that he posseses any depth to his understanding of the political realm. His Father he seemed to have some integrity. Unfortunately that doesnt mean anything. I think junior is impulsive and arrogant a bad combo for President of the U.S. I like the way Coco Van Articulates her comment I agree a hundred percent.
