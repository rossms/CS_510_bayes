I don't see why Edmontonians feel the need to bash Calgary so insistently. Nobody in Calgary gives a rat's ass about Edmonton- we look to Vancouver and Toronto for inspiration; Edmonton is irrelevant to us, you might consider the same outlook. Anyway, Calgary is amazing and so is most of the rest of Alberta- the parts worth visiting are without par, meaning the Rockies parks, Drumheller, and of course Calgary. Avoid Edmonton at all costs. Oh, to the life-less moron who called Alberta Oklahoma North- you know and I know and everyone knows that you have never been to Alberta OR Oklahoma. They share NOTHING.
