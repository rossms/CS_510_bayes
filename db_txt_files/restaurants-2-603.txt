The occasional hot doughnut is fine, but too often it feels and tastes like a bucket of lard going down your throat. The selection is extraordinarily poor as well, and way overpriced. My advice: seek out the nearest local family-run doughnut store, where they don't have a giant machine mass-produce the things.
