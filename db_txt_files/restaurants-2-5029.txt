Visited Olive Garden for the first time in a long time last week. Pushy service, over priced chain food. $2 for dipping sauce for my breadsticks...please! It used to be a treat to go to Olive Garden. Now I recognize it for what it is, an ordinary chain restaurant. Maybe my tastes have just grown up. For the price, I will visit my local upscale establishment. By the way: the salad is the same that you buy in bags at the store with a few extras tossed in, and the breadsticks are just heat and eat with garlic powder sprinkled on top. Make it at home and save yourself the money (and the 45 minute wait).
