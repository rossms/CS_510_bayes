7 Passenger mid-sized SUV with torque, saftey, stability, storage, and style. Replaced my wife's minivan with this thing...as Cleveland winters require 4WD often. Got the XL, loaded with everything but the DVD player (my kids are already vidiots ). Dual passenger climate control sensor went out, in month 2 of ownership, but was replaced without a hassle.
