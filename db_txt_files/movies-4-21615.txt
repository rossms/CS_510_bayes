As a block-buster film this is great and very entertaining, well acted fairly good direction and amazing Make Up and special FX. As an adaptation of a book it is fairly true to its roots. Changing some things that die hard fans may find annoying and leaving out otehr parts. You have to understand that this is a Film not the Book. Watch it with no expectations and everything should be OK.
