Cowher is a great coach. He generates fans and that is why he is still there. The Patriots are just one tough team but look at Cowher's record, 16 wins and 2 losses. Not many coaches hold that in the 2004-5 season. He is macho with a strong personality and stands up when he thinks he is right; what more does one need in a coach? Tinkerbell he aint. He is the steel image that defines Pittsburgh.
