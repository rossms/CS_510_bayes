I own a 4cyl 2000 Coug and i couldn't have picked a better car. Excellent handling, awesome gas mileage, and decent acceleration for a four cyl. I have put almost 30k miles on in a year's time and it hardly shows. The style is a nice mix of sport, luxury, and economy. Plus with the back seats folded down there is an impressive amount of cargo space. This is definitly the best year for the Cougar since the seventies. 2000 cougar is just an all-around nice ride.
