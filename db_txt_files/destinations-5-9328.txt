When I took a trip to Puerto Rico, I honestly was not expecting much more than to have a great time with a good friend. While this certainly was the case, I found the island to have a draw of its own. Cruising aroungd the island and looking at some of its breathtaking sights, trekiking throught he national park, and enjoying the climate were some of the highlights. I'd go back there in a heartbeat. Had a number of incredible lunches while I was there too. The food is great!
