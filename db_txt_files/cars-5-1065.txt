I researched for a new car for about 6 mo. before getting rid of my nightmare Range Rover. My goals were to save money, find a powerful V6 engine, comfort/amenities, and lack of problems in a car. Keeping that in mind, you can't beat the 2001 Nissan Maxima SE. That was the SMART side of my buying decision. What you can't put a price tag on is how many heads it will turn, and how much FUN it is to drive. Yes, people will constantly challenge you at the line, with very few people that will ever see you in their rear view mirror. Excellent buy! Highly recommended.
