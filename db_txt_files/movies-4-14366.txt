Wow. So, I wasn't sure what I thought about the movie until I read the reviews that completely bashed it. For those of you who believe there was no story line, you're wrong. For those of you who wished you had seen a more wholesome movie, maybe you should have. And for those of you who felt like either puking or walking out (but didn't!) I completely agree. That's what makes Requim for a Dream such a good movie - it catches you where no other movie has caught you before. It tells it to you like it is, and not how you hoped it would be. It's truthful, and it's amazing.
