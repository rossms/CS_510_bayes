I've had an opportunity to spend a good deal of time on this campus - both as a recruiter and a vendor - and I have been very impressed. The kids are for the most part serious students, multi-cultural, and seem happy to be there (as opposed to UM where everybody is a spoiled brat). Apparently FIU is the fastest growing school in the country and is consistently rated as one of the best values for your educational dollar. From a recruitment perspective, FIU is the place to go to get hard-working, bi-lingual engineers.
