Beautiful place. But it seems like most Mexicans have failed their History. They like to claim that they are of pure blood. Do they know that they are decendants of Spanish and Native Americans, guess not. Im very disgusted by their ignorance by saying that they are pure spanish blood. Im afriad to say they have no roots, but if they have known their roots, I will definetly give them more respect.
