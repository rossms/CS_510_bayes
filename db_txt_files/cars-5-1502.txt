i have to say i disagree with the other guy here. i own one, my first new car, and it rides like a couch on wheels. i like the rear end, the retro circle lights i think look good. obviously not the best car out there, but very roomy, the trunk is probably the biggest in the market, drives great, awesome stock stero system, GREAT on gas 20+ miles to the gallon, and so on and so on
