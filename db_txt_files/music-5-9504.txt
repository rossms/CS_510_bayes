I don't care what anyone says, Michael Jackson was the man. Although I love the previous Off the Wall album, Motown still produced the funky Thriller album. For years the best selling album, the title track was number one for weeks. I think the songwriting is very intelligent and Michael Jackson really makes a song have life and energy. Good album. Great.
