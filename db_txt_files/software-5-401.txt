Ahhh! Good ol' Windows 98 SE... I remember a time when life was great, when games worked properly, when the blue screen appeared only 2,3 times per month, when the sky was blue and everything was great in the world..... Then I installed Windows ME :( Now I haven't tried XP yet but I belive this is the best OS Microsoft ever made. maybe XP is indeed good, but it takes alot of memory. 98 SE is good, stable, and doesn't take much memory, you do the math.
