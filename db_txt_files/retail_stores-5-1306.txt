I noticed quite a few people feel that Nordstrom is too expensive. I really feel like it's the best department store out there. It's an upscale department store and doesn't have downscale items. Stores like Macy's has both upscale and downscale so it seems overcrowded with merchandise. Nordstrom has just the best items. The service is just an added value.
