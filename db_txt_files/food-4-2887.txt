Godiva makes awesome chocolates. They must make some of the best dark chocolate in the world: it has little to no bitterness or aftertaste, which is something very common in standard boxed dark chocolates. Their milk chocolate has a very smooth, creamy texture. The only other chocolate I know of with such a smooth texture is Dove. I love Godiva raspberry chocolate bits and chocolate biscuits. The only real drawback to their product is the price.
