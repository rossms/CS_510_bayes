Great President. He gets stuff done and that makes a lot of people mad. That's what makes a great president, one who steps on a few toes to get things done. You never see Democrats get anything done. Look at history. The only great Democrat was Kennedy and his brother Ed is just a sick joke to me. Look at all the other democratic presidents, they just hung out and enjoyed being in office, especially good old Billy Bob Clinton...... just ask Monica. Too bad presidents can't run for a third term, Bush would have my vote. That's my opinion though and it will never be changed. Ever!!
