More progressive than her husband, who to me was, at best, a moderate republican. I wish she had been or would be president, although, of course, that can never happen. In a country where someone can't get elected if they have a vowel on the end of their names, or, God forbid, are not a Christian, it's unlikely we'll ever elect a woman, especially a vocal, strong-minded woman. Hopefully, I'm wrong, but I don't think I am.
