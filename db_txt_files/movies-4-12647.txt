The 'Mad Black Woman' had to have been some sort of saint...who would so graciously put up with what she did? Also, the movie made her dramatic lifestyle transition seem way too easy...not so in real life! But, overall, it is still a feel-good moive with a lot of laughs, particularly from her 'Grandma' (Is that who she was?), and even the old pervert that lives with the granny. Watch it!
