Although their prices are a bit high, Barnes & Noble is a plain awesome store. A wide selection of not only books, but magazines and DVDs, as well as a constant supply of calendars and bargain books. Great internal and external designs and always well kept with great customer service. Barnes & Noble is a great bookstore franchise!
