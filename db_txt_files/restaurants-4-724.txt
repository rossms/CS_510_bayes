DQ is not quite the best fast food chain, but its cool. Their chicken sandwiches (almost always on sell for 99 cents) don't beat Chick-Fil-A, but are still good. Their french fries are also surpringly good! Their desserts are both thrifty and of high quality. Their service is somewhat slow, but not Burger King-slow.
