well done movie with Bette Davis and Joan Crawford. Baby Jane is a former child star. she is much older now and has to take care of her invalid sister. Baby Jane is slowly loosing her mind and taking it out on her sister. she does some awful scarey stuff to her like serving her a dead rat for dinner.Bette Davis must of had ball playing the scarey wacko sister. From what I have heard Bette Davis and Joan Crawford actually despised one another, so the working conditions must have been interesting.pretty good movie though.
