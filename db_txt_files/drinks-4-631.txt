My favorite light Mexican beer. Slight hint of sweetness, but nicely done. Rather refreshing. Easily beats the Corona, Tecate and Dos Equis for a light beer. Just well rounded for a light beer in general. This is an easy sipping beer and nothing too complicated. Here's a great thing to try. Take a sip of the beer and top your bottle off with a 1/2 shot of Charbay Key Lime Vodka. Awesome!
