I have to disagree with Lukskywlkr, in that if you don't like America, you SHOULD live here, because this is one of the few countries in the world where you are EXPECTED to voice your displeasure with National policy. the fact that we can voice our displeasure with America is one of the things that makes America so great!!! And by the way, if anyone actually thinks that BLAQPOWER is black, you are an idiot. My money is that it's a 13-17 year old rural white kid who thinks it's funny to emulate urban African-American speech patterns.
