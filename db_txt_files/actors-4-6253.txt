Has a more diverse body of work than some might htink. He has done some very good work but overall he rates as good. I am not sure he has ever done anything as an actor worth rating as great but is one of the few who seems to have avoided much worth rating as terrible. Revenge of the Nerds was one but he got out of that quickly. Unlike his co-star who kept trudging along on that nonsense.
