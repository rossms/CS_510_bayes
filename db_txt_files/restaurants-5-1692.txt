If you've never stopped by Jimmy Johns, and are lucky enough to have one in town- next time you're hungry do yourself a favor and stop in for a sub. Since I started college last year it's been my favorite food joint in town. Huge sandwiches, fresh bread, real meats, good vegetables- and they slice it all in the store. none of that processed crap. The bread is the best i've ever had too, anywhere (sorry ma) from... mmm, they're open till three think I might just order some now that I think about it...
