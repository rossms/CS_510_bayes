Do people really think Jalen is strictly an outside shooter? He can and does take the ball to the rack with the best of them. Who knows? He might even be as popular as Miller if he would just learn to mouth off to the crowd, hassle refs, talk more game than he actually has etc., etc... Reggie should really take him under his wing as a mentor figure.
