Hair compared hippies and the wealthy class, and how they lived. The two classes had completely different views on life and war. There was a large contrast between the fancy social gatherings of the wealthy and the carefree living of the hippies (swimming in ponds, crashing higher class parties, etc.). Hair also introduced topics of war, the personal lives of families from the two classes of people, etc. I liked the broad range of issues and the songs incorporated into the movie.
