Calling him no better than Al Kaline is a disgrace. Clemente was the rare player who had no weaknesses. Consider the era he played, and the massive ballpark he played in while looking at his stats. He had the most hits of any player in the 1960s and is universally regarded as the best right fielder ever. To see him play was truly to understand his greatness.
