DUDE, BARRY SANDERS IS THE GREATEST ALL-TIME. HE'LL FAKE YOU OUT BEFORE YOU CAN SAY "D**N I MISSED HIM". AND HE ONLY PLAYED TEN SEASONS! AND THATS THE REASON WHY THE LIONS WERE LOSING, THEY DIDN'T GIVE HIM THE BALL INSIDE THE RED ZONE. BARRY SANDERS IS THE GREATEST ALL-TIME. -COMMENT ME BACK IF YOU AGREE WITH ME.
