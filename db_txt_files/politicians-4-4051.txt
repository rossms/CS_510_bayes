I'm a Republican but I have to say that I respect Dianne Feinstein as a Senator - she truly has a mind of her own and doesn't always vote the party line, which is how it should be. When you see her speak, you get the feeling that she really knows what she's talking about and would be just fine without her notes in front of her, unlike some of her colleagues who really have no clue what's going on unless they read the speech their staff prepared for them.
