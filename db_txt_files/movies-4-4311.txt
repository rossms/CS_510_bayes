More like a 3.5. Admittedly, the movie had some great moments. It breaks the fourth wall once or twice and every scene involving established fairy tale characters was great. However, for an animated comedy, the movie takes itself a bit too seriously at times. Also, the bodily function gags just aren't funny. The sequel, however, looks to be an imporvement with more pop-culture references, fairy tale characters and breaking the fourth wall (judging from the trailers).
