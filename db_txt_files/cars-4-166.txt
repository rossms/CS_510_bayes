Very difficult to start if it has not been running for a few days. The primer has to be used repeatedly and this is a bit of a pain considering that the right side cover has to be removed each time. Also had problems with a seized choke cable. Other than that it is really great with nimble steering and the best working transmission I have ever tried.
