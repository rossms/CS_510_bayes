The greatest President of my lifetime. As a child growing up, President Reagan was a strong and vocal leader that I looked up to. I was 10 when he was re-elected by a landslide and became my political hero. I will always remember how he rose to the ocassion to console the nation in times of grief. Especially the Space Shuttle and the difficult times with terrorism. He was a visionary and above reproach. I regret my children will have never known him. God Bless the man who will always be My President
