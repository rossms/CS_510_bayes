I enjoy visiting Chicago more than NYC, mainly because the people are NICER. That really makes a difference. The downtown area is more compact--all of the stuff you'd want to see (Sears Tower, the old water tower, John Hancock building, Wrigley building, the Chicago River boats) are within walking distance (but wear a good pair of shoes!) I visited during the summer--so I imagine a rating would be docked a half to full star had I visited in the dead of winter.
