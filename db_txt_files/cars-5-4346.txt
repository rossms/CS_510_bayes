I love G.M. cars, but my main reason for writing this is BIGBABY's comment about G.M. cloning their vechiles, EVERY car company does it, from Lexus and Toyota to Chrysler and Dodge. All the Chrysler mini-vans (Voyager, Town Country, and Caravan) just like all the G.M. mini-vans are all the same, just different levels of luxury. G.M. ISN'T THE ONLY ONE THAT DOES IT!!!!!
