The trick, as in any traveling was advance planning. Saving money by staying at the local B B's (which thanks to the internet are easy to find); the hotels tend to be a bit expensive, and the B B's usally offer a pretty good breakfast. Traveling around is fairly easy, and of course the TUBE, and the bus system in London takes the worry out of getting around.
