He's a big, physical guy. He's got a powerful arm. He improved his pocket presence last year, but he'll still take off and run like a big halfback if he's in trouble. He's 266 and can run like the wind. He still has some trouble with reading coverages, going to the second or third option, but he'll mature and start seeing the whole field.
