The Microsoft/McDonald's/Starbucks of video rental places, and they act like it. Titles are often all rented out (especially at their smaller locations), staff is out to lunch, and I haven't found a video store with higher rental prices. They're OK if you have no other choices, which in many towns is often the case, but just about any competitor can beat the pants off of them. Their recent dropping of late fees just shows how desperately they're groping for customers.
