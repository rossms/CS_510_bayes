He is such a good actor that I sometimes don't hear a voice inside my head yelling Come awn, Come awn when I see him. I first saw him in Basketball Diaries and I thought he was great. He was also quite good in Boogie Nights and Three Kings. These are a wide range of roles which shows his versatility as an actor. Donnie must be wicked bittah.
