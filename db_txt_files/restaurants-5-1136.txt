My husband and I love popeye's spicy chicken but live 3 hrs away from the nearest one. So every few months we go and buy about $40 worth take it home and freeze it in a vacuum sealer in about 6pc servings. Then when we get a craving for some we cook it like Banquet chicken in the oven. Taste just as good as when we get it fresh but spicier .. Love popeyes chicken
