I'm not sure how good of a halfback or fullback he'd make, since I've noticed an alarming tendency for Vick to lose the handle. As for quarterback, he can't read a defense to make accurate throws, when he tries, he fails (incomplete or picked off), and his only other option is to run or eat the sack.
