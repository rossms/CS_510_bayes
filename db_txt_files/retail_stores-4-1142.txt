I like Wet Seal! They have good sales there and I haven't had any bad experiences with their clothing. I bought a sweatshirt and a shrug-like top there last year and they fit me perfectly. I haven't had them fall apart or tear in the washer yet, which means that they're pretty durable. I'll be a returning customer. Wet Seal rocks my world!
