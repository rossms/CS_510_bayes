Dont smoke and never have...I choose these because if I remember correctly, they had built-in, hollowed out,3 chambered filters, and were packaged in a flimsy,flip top plastic box. The butts were good for finding on the ground, holding on your knee w/1 finger, and thumping thru your moms open car window for a 'field goal. Any surviving Multifilter smokers out there?
