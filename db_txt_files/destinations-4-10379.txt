When I was a full flavor smoker these are what I smoked. They are too strong for me now that I am a Marlboro Light 100's smoker, but in my opinion these are the best full flavors and they have all cotton butts if you are one who is concerned with the environment. The tobacco tastes the best in these. I don't like the lights or ultra lights very well, but the ff's are awesome!
