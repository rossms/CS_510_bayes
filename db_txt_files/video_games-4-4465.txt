Vastly improved diplomacy making adversaries more fun to play. I like the idea of specialized units unique to each civilization. The advisors are actually helpful and sometimes funny (put all resources towards science and he'll still complain we don't have enough funding!) I miss the exotic technologies and units from Call to Power though and don't care for the mandatory retirement year 2050, though I understand it in context of the game.
