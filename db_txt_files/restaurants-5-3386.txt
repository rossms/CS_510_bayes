Pizza Hut by far kicks Domino's ass. The flavor is just way better, as is the crust (stuffed crust is my favorite). I wish they would deliver more in my hood (nyc), because Domino's is the chain that delivers regulary here. But Pizza Hut is the best, bottom line. The Meat lover's and Pepperoni Lover's rock!!!!!!!! MMMMMMMM
