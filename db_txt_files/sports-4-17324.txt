The Eagles are oubviously a good team.'mnot an Eagles fa, but Ido believe theyare on of the best teams in the NFL. The've proved they can beatgood teams( S.F and Stl.) even without their bestplayer Donovan McNabb.Give Andy Reid alot of credit, he's really pulled the team together during a time when others would have crumbled.
