I have a lot of respect for Ralph Nader. I disagree with his stance on many issues, foreign policy and social, but he appears to be much more honest than most politicians. Here is a guy who is about 70 years old and has a belief and passion for what he believes in that is rarely seen nowadays. His speeches are given in front of very small crowds yet this does not distract or deter him in any way. The Democratic Party officials seem concerned that Nader will be on the ballot in certain states but I think that Nader will snag almost as many votes from the Republican Party as from the Democratic Party.
