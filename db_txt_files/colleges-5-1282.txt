I wonder where the guy who said weenies goes? heh. I go to Cal, and really think it's one of the most interesting, diverse places I've ever seen, as well as being an excellent university. I don't know if moving out of Berkeley after school will be able to measure up.....oh well, time to go give Stanford a 1 (j/k, I toured there and decided not to go, but it still gets a 5 I suppose)
