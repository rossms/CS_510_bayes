I go to Denver almost annually and I can't say a bad thing about this city. It's huge, has lots to do (sports, bars, restaurants, etc.) but the best activities (biking, hiking, skiing) are out of town, but thankfully within a reasonable driving distance. It seems to be a central city with a very West Coast feel to it.
