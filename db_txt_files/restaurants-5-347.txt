I love that Wendy's offer baked potatoes as a choice for their side items. When I go to wendy's, I almost always get a clasic double plain with a baked potato and take it home and just eat the hamberger steak and baked potato like if i went to sit-down restaraunt. It is very satisfying for about half the price. Their current recipe for chili is an improvement over the last one.
