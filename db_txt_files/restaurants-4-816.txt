subway is a decent sandwich restaurant. It is a nice change of pace from burger, or taco fastfood.You can get a wide variety of subs there. I get a choice of a 6inch or footlong. they offer a value meal with a sub, chips, and beverage. The prices are decent. You can choose your toppings. I would rate their sandwiches as good tasting. Our family likes eating here on occasion and the most of the sandwiches are better for you than fast food burgers.
