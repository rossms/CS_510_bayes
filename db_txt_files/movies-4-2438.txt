Certainly not one of Shane Black's best scripts, but nevertheless, The Long Kiss Goodnight provides some great action and comedy. Geena Davis plays suburban mother Samantha Cain, who after a case of amnesia begins to discover that she was once an assassin for the CIA by the name of Charly Baltimore. Along with Samuel L. Jackson, Davis is supurb in her role. Furthermore, an amusing performance from Brian Cox puts this film over the top as an above average action film. Highly recommended!
