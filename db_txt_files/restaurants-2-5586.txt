I'd like to rate this place higher than two stars. I like the 24 hour concept. Alas the one in Waukegan is not open until after I have to be at work. Good breakfast items, decent lunch and dessert selections negated by incompetent or rude waitstaff. Once upon a time there existed a 24 hour restaurant which had it all. Excellent food, service, and coffee. Alas, Sambo's was done in by the first salvo of political-correctness.
