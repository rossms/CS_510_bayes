At no point in this film does the storyline gel and I can only assume the scriptwriters (the Farrellys) had guns held to their head whilst writing, that, or more likely they were trying too hard. Therefore, what we get is a mish-mash of half-hearted jokes that some will like and others won't. In an attempt to define the cutting-edge, we are just left with childish, bordering on irrational humour and so I couldn't recommend renting this film.
