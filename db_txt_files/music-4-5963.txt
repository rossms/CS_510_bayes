this album was alot more recognised for the Enter Sandman track but instead of people believing they'd become mainstream I believe that more people opened their eyes to metallicas talent. Many of these song contained the old style and added a few new sounds the guitar solo in My Friend of Misery has familiar artistic sounds similar to that on War of the Worlds
