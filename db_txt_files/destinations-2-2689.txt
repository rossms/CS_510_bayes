I am rather indifferent to this place. There is a lot to do here. However, most of the attractions fail to meet the hype. The Art Institute is sensational and so are the resaurants. Chicago probably is the best city in the midwest. However, I enjoyed cities with less rousing reputaions, such as Cincinnati and Minneapolis, almost to the same degree.
