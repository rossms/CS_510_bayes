I went to Cal and thats when I realized that I didn't like it at all. It might be in California but its in Northern Cali. number one and the campus is not pretty at all. I got in and did not go and now I go to Bucknell. Cal is not even close to Yale and Harvard. If I wanted to go to college and hate it and say ohh I go to Berkeley I would have gone there. A little too liberal for me.
