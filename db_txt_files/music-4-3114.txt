Mixed bag in my view, but more good than bad, about a 3.5 star album in my view. In addition to the three classic radio staples on this album, "The Changeling" and "The W.A.S.P." (Texas Radio and the Big Beat) are really good as well. I actually like the sinister "L'America." Some of the rest is pedestrian IMO.
