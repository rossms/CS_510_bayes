ok! I don't know why everybody is raggin on AE cuz if its the same thing as A&F and your still buyin it, thats stupid wastin your money on some $50 shirts and $80 for some pants! shoot, I saw some pants at Goodys and they looked just like A&F pants!lol...anyways wats the point of wastin your money on something when the same thing is sitting right in front of you and its better quality and itsless expensive and it seems like all the stuck up girls absolutely HAVE to wear A&F!AE is an overall better store!
