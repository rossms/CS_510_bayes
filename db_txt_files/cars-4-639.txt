Had mine sinse 2001. It was a little slow out of the hole but I changed the front sprocket from a 33 to a 31 tooth gear. Changed the ingnition to a Dyna 3000, chromed her up a little and get nothing but looks all day. Blow the doors off most Harleys and last a lot longer. To make a long story short, great bike, great price, great looks.
