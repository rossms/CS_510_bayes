Did some loony say Scotland and Wales are part of England? That person was obviously asleep during geography lessons (or any lessons I suspect). Fick or wot? Anyway, Britain can be very nice and the countryside is often very beautiful. There are good rstaurants to be be found too if you know where to look. No one in their right mind would exist on the stodgy pies and mushy peas that some poor misguided fools call food. One day, with Jamie Oliver's help, Britain may start eating better. More fruit and veg and less flesh is the way. Clean soul, clean bowel. I am a Londoner living in the south west.
