Say it ain't so Joe! Your concience and voice of reason and moral authority have constantly worked to elevate the American culture. (Your Silver Sewer Awards are just one example). Now you've allowed yourself to be pimped-out by Al Gore for his personal political hubris. See your statement on the republicn mobs in Fla. Shame on you.
