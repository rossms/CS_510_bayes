game....cube...sucks, and if i had it i would use it as a door stop most likely. it has poor games,that only children under 8 would play,and it has almost no virtual memory. x-box has over 4.2 giga bytes of ram. and has awesome games. (especially halo) it has overall,better gameplay,graphics,ram memory,speed,and even has a better name. basicly gamecube is nothing but a small box of virtual crap,no better than the original nintendo.
