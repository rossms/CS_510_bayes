Although we are on opposite sides of the political aisle, I like him. His message during the convention was optimistic without being patronizing. What a pleasant and welcome change from the hand wringing and tired rhetoric our friends on the other side have been feeding us. I need to learn more about his views and positions but from what I have seen, the man has great potential and hopefully there will be more people with his outlook and attitude to breathe new life into the Democratic party.
