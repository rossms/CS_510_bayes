I told myself I would never listen to 'N Sync, but after listening to my cousin's CD I can see why this whole world loves 'N Sync. They are everywhere because they sell albums. Their songs are catchy and infectious from Bye, Bye, Bye to It's Gonna' Be Me to I Thought She Knew. The only song I hate is Space Cowboy.
