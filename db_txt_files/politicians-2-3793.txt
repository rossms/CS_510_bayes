George W. Bush...now that he is up against the wire, we see a little more into him. Do we really want a man for President who will put something into legislation (like the hand recount of votes to settle disputes legislation in TX) only to contest it when the law does not work for himself? What is Bush afraid of???? If he is truly confident that he won Florida, why is he having such a problem in making sure it was an accurate count? Why not just let the people of Palm Beach county have a revote??? Is he scared?
