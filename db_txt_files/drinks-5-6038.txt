This is my favorite diet soda. But you can hardly ever find it in our town, and even then you can only get it at gas stations in 20-oz. bottles. (please note: I keep re-posting this because someone who is infatuated with me keeps giving it 11 negative votes...if some kind soul out there will just give me just one positive, I'll stop commenting about Diet Coke - thanks!)
