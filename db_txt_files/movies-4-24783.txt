Dungeons and Dragons may not be the best fantasy movie ever made, but it's still a really fun movie to see. It's very true to the concept of the D D game. Jeremy Irons performance as the Profion is slightly over the top though. But the lead villain in the movie makes up for it. Damodar, played by Bruce Payne, looks and acts very intimidating. He's a greal classic villain, and makes the heroes very likeable. The effects aren't fantastic, but I don't think they have to be. This is just a fun movie. It's great to finally see fantasy making a comeback in movies.
