The multi-grain Cheerios are the ones I like best. There's no way on earth I can wax poetic about them as John did -- I DO like the chivalrous chevalier at the chateau of Chenonceaux, and I can't believe you actually came up with all those great ch phrases! -- but I do think they make a good breakfast. Actually, though, my favourite way to eat Cheerios is in nuts and bolts!
