Delicious coffee! Particulary the Mocca Java, Costa Rica Peaberry and the European offerings like Cafe Sperl. Yes - compared to grocery store coffees, this is expensive, but try comparing the price of one pot to a nice bottle of wine, then do the math and see how many pots you get out of a 1/2 lb bag. I say the taste is worth it!! Still cheaper than those overpriced per-cup Starbucks offerings - IF you can figure out how to order them! :-)
