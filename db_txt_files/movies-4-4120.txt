While not one of my favorites, its certainly a movie I always enjoyed. Gene Wilder was fantastic, his portrayal both eerie and fun. For those complaining about the creepiness and disgusting factor of the movie, I must remind them that this is based on a book by Roald Dahl. His writing was not all flowers and rainbows for children. He wrote odd, disturbing stories that are widely acclaimed. This movie was just staying true to the book. A fun, visual journey for the imagination.
