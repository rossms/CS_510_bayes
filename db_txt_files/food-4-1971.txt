I would just like to leave a comment for some of the raters here. First of all- Wiggum doesn't know what he's talking about because goober is another name for peanut. He's confusing the word booger with the word goober, which is easy to do when you don't know what you're talking about. Second of all, how can alicat rate the product when they've never even tried it? At least give the candy a chance.
