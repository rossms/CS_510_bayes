Well, Rage Against the Machine are a very interesting band because of their political songs. They touch on a lot of issues such as human rights. They have a stand that is very distinct. If you take the time to listen to what they are trying to say, you will be surprised. I know that the lead singer has a PHD in Sociology (or something like that).
