I dont see what the big deal is. I was afraid to drink Tequila because of all the horror stories I have heard. So the first time I had Tequila was Jose Cuervo Gold. 4 shots...went down with no problem and 4 margaritas. Felt nice and good. I didnt have a hangover or headache at all. Am I drinking something different.
