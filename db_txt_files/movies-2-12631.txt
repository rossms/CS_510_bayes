My son in law let me see this last night; It was ok, not Kidman's best of course. I am not into Will Ferrell too much, but I have to admit I got a good laugh at one point in the movie. The rest of it was not very funny. The whole time I am thinking what is the plot, exactly? It ended sort of abruptly. I wouldn't have paid to see it, and I don't suggest any of you do, either!
