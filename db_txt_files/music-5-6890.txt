Of all the miles davis album - this is the one i would take to a desert island if i could only take one album. kind of blue is considered by the majority of jazz musicians as the finest example of jazz recorded - ever. if you do not own it - go buy it - now. jazz doesn't get any better than this. after 40 years - it is still fresh - and - unfortunetely - we have no musician of miles stature today. bill boyd - ventura - california
