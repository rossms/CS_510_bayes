I also used to pick up radio broadcasts of the White Sox on my transistor radio in upstate NY when i was a kid. I remember when Harry Carey was announcing for the White Sox. Around that time, Chet Lemon was my favorite ballplayer. He gave solid numbers and solid defense. Now, we have a bright future with young starts coupled with older veterans such as Frank Thomas and Bartolo Colon. I expect to win our division this year and to go to the World Series, where we havent been in 5 decades. GO SOX!!
