Just finished 3 long years balancing work, family and study with the open university for the MBA. Very broad ranging courses, good course material, pretty good tutors (some outstanding) and working with great students from a very wide range of backgrounds and professions. The ability to bring the course to life through your normal work situations and experience, and just as importantly vice versa make this type of distance learning experience superb. Can't recommend it enough - well done Open University.
