OK, if you are going to Chuck E. Cheese's, you are not going for the culinary experience and you are definitely not going for a relaxing meal. If you have kids, nieces,nephews, grandchildren and you want to be their hero for a couple hours, bring them to Chuck E. Cheese's. Fun games, an entertaining stage show, prizes and pizza..a kid's idea of heaven!
