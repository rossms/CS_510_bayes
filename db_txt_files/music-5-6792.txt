Dont let the title of this album fool you...the CD is downright jammin! If your new to the world of Limp Bizkit, then this is the one to give them the benefit of a doubt. I gave it to em, and I wasnt at all sorry. Songs like Rollin are enough to make the entire album, but the fun doesnt stop there. Im Broke is a good song for your girlfriend to listen to. If you dont have this album, you dont know what in Gods name your missing!
