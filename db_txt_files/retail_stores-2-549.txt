Why oh why do I still go into this store? I haven't bought anything but a white tank top from this store since the early ninties. The clothes are cheap, trendy, and trashy. They have ridiculous colors that are horrendous. It is like they take the new trend, brighten the color, and then make is shorter or tighter. I admit, I still go into the store, but I always do a once around and leave, wondering why I even went in in the first place.
