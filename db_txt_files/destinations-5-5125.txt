Vermont is my friendly neighbor to the north. You can have fun there every season of the year. in winter you ski. In spring and summer you go hiking in the mountains. in the fall you go apple picking and drink hot cider, while buying fresh cheese. I don't know why, bu the air is crisper up there. I'm glad that no big cities are left in vermont because it's one of the few unurbanized places in new england.
