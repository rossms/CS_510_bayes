This Coffee tasted like somebody emptied the pencil sharpener and tried to brew it. I would say the aftertaste leaves an aftertaste. It was cheap, which motivated me to try it, but i think that is all it really had going for it. I gave it two stars just because i really liked their little history on the side of the tin.
