Alot of the clothing is pretty high priced and bland as some people put it. I never find anything for myself. I love GAPKIDS though. I only buy their stuff on sale. If you can find something on sale you end up paying Old Navy prices. I just got my daughter a pair of jeans for $9.99 and a long sleeve t for $4.97. I was pretty pleased.
