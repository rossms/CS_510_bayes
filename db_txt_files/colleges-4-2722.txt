I may be a little biased since I'm an alumni of UNCW, but I can tell you it has one of the most beautiful campuses around. In fact, they film the TV show Dawson's Creek there. Wilmington is a wonderful college and beach town, and even if you don't go to school there, you should visit - an be sure to go to Wrightsville Beach, you won't be dissapointed. As far as academics and the college's faculty, you'll find that most are good, but not what I would call exceptional...with the exception of a few!
