McDonald's is a very good place. The fries are yummy, the burgers are good. Not as good as Burger King's. The Chicken Selects are yummy. And the breakfast items such as Sausage biscuits and Hash Browns are very delishious UPDATE: Since it's so unhealthy for you, i'm going to only eat here sparingly.
