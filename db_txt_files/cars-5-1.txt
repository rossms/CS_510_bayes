if you get one of these in a 4x4 model you basically have a tank.........with the right weight and tires the 4x4 swith diff lock.it wont allow you to get stuck either so i personally think that their only flaw is that they arent the greatest on high speed trail riding....they are stable strong running machines and are very reliable and with the 15 dofferent gear selections they are great for pulling just abpout what ever you want....!
