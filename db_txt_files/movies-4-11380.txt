I tried this movie out and I found out it was better than I thought it would be he gets stuck in the elevator with Tony Robbins and he gets Hal to see the inner beauty in woman instead of judging them on their outter apperances then he ends up meeting rosemary who he sees as a thin beautiful woman who ends up being 300 lbs. Then his friend wants the old hal back so he unhypnotised him but Hal realizes he never liked rosemary for her looks and he ended up falling in love with rosemary. I thought it was a cute movie, it had funny scenes throughout the movie.
