Sure, this was an immense book, but it was immense fun reading it, as well! There was the usual action, but Harry's teen angst this time around was an interesting part of the story. Of course, the death of a major character -- and one of my favorites, to boot -- made me cry for hours afterwards . . . now I just have to wait three freakin' years to see what happens . . .
