Good slap-hitter, ala Ichiro. Like Ichiro, he doesn't walk much. Main difference is that Ichiro is a better-version )hits for a higher average, and has more power). Does steal more bases than Ichiro, on the go-go Marlins. Another difference is that Pierre is more consistent. Ichiro runs out of gas every August and his stats nosedive.
