George Brett won three batting titles in three different decades (I would call that consistent). He was elected to the Hall Of Fame with a %98 approval rating (You won't see 98 out of 100 sportswriters agree on too many things--so that says something). Every time I saw him play he taught me something new about the game and how to win.
