Piers is still going strong and has yet to put down his puncil! I have read and re-read most of the series... the cri-tics hate him, but for some reason the rest of the reading public thinks his books are fantastic fantasy. I think it boils down to this: those who can-do, those who can't-complain! Go ahead I guarantee a good thyme will be had by all.
