I've had a Sony SPP-D900 for about four years now, and I've been pretty happy with it. It's a digital 900 mhz phone, which makes for good sound quality and range. But a couple years ago I accidentally stepped on it, and all of a sudden it started going silent every now and then, just for a second. Yes, I know phones aren't designed to be stepped on. But I wish the thing was just a little bit more durable. Still, all things considered the SPP Series is solid.
