I like Colin Powell. Seems like a very respectable person. For a politician at least. 10 years ago he was a lock for president. Having associated himself with an administration liberals despise has cost him the broad base appeal he once held firmly. An eventual run for president seems likely and I would still have him as an odds on favorite. It is likely better to wait until 2012 than risk running too soon in 2008.
