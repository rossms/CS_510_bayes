This girl will try no matter what you guys say. Although she couldn't act her way out of a paper bag, she really tries. Most of the stars she recieves are actually from her singing career which is one thing she can do. Tell me how you not like at least one her songs. She is the master of get-stuck-in-your-head songs. She gets the fourth star for this one thing I say in the paper. She met a fan in the mall but she couldn't listen to any of her C.D's because her family was so poor so Brandy bought her all her C.D's plus a C.D player.
