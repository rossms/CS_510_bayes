I had a great time at Maggiano's. Quality wise, the food is not great but good. It doesn't come close to a trip to Little Italy, but how many places do? The large quantity of food makes it enjoyable, especially with a large group of people. Its definitely a place I would go again if I had to take a group of people, as long as they were all ready to eat. If there were some light eaters in the group, the money would be better off spent going some other place.
