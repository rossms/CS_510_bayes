Very tough HITTER but not an all around great baseball player by any stretch of the imagination. Ramirez has exceptional power and knock in a lot of runs. Though his numbers peter out in the second half of the season he almost always hits well above .300 with 30-40 home runs. His downfall is his shoddy fielding and bad attitude.
