I ve always thought this was an over-looked candy bar. They re very nutty and chewy and I ve always enjoyed them. As a child, they were one of my favorite candies to buy with my soda bottle money and to receive when Trick or Treating. The trouble is, you just don t see them around much any more it seems. Well, that may not be entirely true since the few times I buy candy these days it is usually just due to an impulse buy on the way out of the grocery store. So, they may just not be showing up at the temptation isle (usually strategically placed to the left and right of the checkout lane).
