It's good if you don't go as a film critic. It's pretty lively and peppy, but don't go for an Oscar win or a deep plot. It's just fun and very teenage. You can't really enjoy it if you think about it too much. That's why critics don't like it, but it's pretty much what's expected if you've seen the trailer.
