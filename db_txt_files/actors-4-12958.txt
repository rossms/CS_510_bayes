Lelee Sobieski is definately an above average actress. She reminds me a lot of Helen Hunt. Pluses (+): She has range- she has proven that. She played in the TV drama Joan of Arc in a mesmerizing performance, as well as in Here on Earth . She was also good in the romantic comedy Never Been Kissed opposite Drew Barrymore. Minuses (-): She's not perfect and there's something about her personality that sticks to all of her characters in all of her films, and it is not a good thing.
