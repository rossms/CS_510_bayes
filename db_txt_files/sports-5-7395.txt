Pete Maravich could do more with the ball than anyone who ever played. He was like a magician. I saw him get 51 points against Phoenix when half his Jazz teammates were injured. He was unstoppable. Lightning in a bootle. He dropped 68 points on the Knicks (without a 3-point line) and fouled out! He's still ahead of his time. The most skilled basketball player ever. (OK, his defense was average)
