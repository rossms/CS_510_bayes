Texas Roadhouse in Brockton and Everett are the best and most fun restaurants I've visited in a long time!!!! The food is tasteful and very reasonalby priced. The atmosphere is energetic and lively....a bit loud but loads of fun none the less!!!! I loved the line dancing and the staff is extremely friendly.......
