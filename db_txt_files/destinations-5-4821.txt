I don't know, why so many people are so negative about Sao Paulo. I don't know whether it is envy, or if some people are just frightened of enormous cities. Greater SP will have 22 million people by 2015. We have 43,000 high-rise buildings, 480 discotheques, 17,800 clubs and bars, 13,000 restaurants, 83 museums, 79 theaters, all parks together have the area of the city of Frankfurt. There is nothing you cannot find here. It is amazing to live here. I lived in Europe for 4 years when I studiewd over there. I was so happy to come back to SP, cause you'll hardly find such a place on earth!
