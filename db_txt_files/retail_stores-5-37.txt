So, where in the world does B&N get all of these roundback, bentwood Bank Of England chairs? I found three from the 1930's here in Chicago, and they were pretty hard to come by. Nice touch, though, for any company with roots to flaunt in a neon and asphalt prairie marketplace. Even the baroque concerti are a plus, in lieu of the christmas carols blaring at my HomeDepot, OfficeDepot & GasDepot!
