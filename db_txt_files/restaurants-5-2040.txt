I have knocked so many fast-food places but I love Checkers!!!! It is inexpensive, the burgers and fries are excellent. The service at the one I go to is very good also, the workers deserve to make more money than they are getting. They have a very limited menu, a way I'm sure to keep prices below most other fast-food places.
