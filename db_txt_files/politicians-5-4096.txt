Nader is the best candidate to run for our country for many years. Our government is so corrupt now, and we need someone to take a stand and see to it that no more presidents can do what hte past presidents have done. I fully support Nader and hope he gets 5% of the populus vote this election so he can have a full campaign with campaign money from our government. if he does get this he will be the best thing to happen to us since roosevelt.
