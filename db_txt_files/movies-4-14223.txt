I liked this movie. Russell Crowe does a fine job as the schizophrenic mathematical genius. I enjoyed Ed Harris as the secret agent man and Paul Bettany as the likable roomate-perhaps the personable type of guy John Nash wished he could be. Crowe was deserving of the Oscar for this performance, but didn't get it probably in part due to some heavily publicized obnoxious behavior that year.
