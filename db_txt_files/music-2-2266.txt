While his first CD made me jump back and take a look, this CD was so bad that I'll listen to his next one before I buy it. I have a feeling this was more studio-influenced than Lang's ultimate choice of music. I recently bought a Double Trouble CD (SRV's old band) and Lang's on one track, and it's AWESOME. He has the talent, if he just sticks to blues, he'll be the man. If he goes down the pop route, which this CD does, he'll be washed away in a sea of obscurity.
