I don't think Ben Affleck can even act. He's been in some pretty bad movies before, Pearl Harbour etc., and he just can't take to acting. Overrated if you ask me. He was actually good in Good Will Hunting, but he just can't take the business. He should continue writing instead. he's good at that. Summary: BAD ACTOR, GOOD WRITER.
