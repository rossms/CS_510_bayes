Anyone who hasn't seen Emma Thompson in The Remains of the Day doesn't know her. She was absolutely wonderful. Too bad she is not with Kenneth Branagh anymore: they made an electric couple (e.g. Much Ado About Nothing). She is one of the great British actress of our times, as much as Julie Christie and Vanessa Redgrave.
