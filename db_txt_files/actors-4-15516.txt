C'mon, folks! NOBODY cares to comment on PUNKY? Yeah, it was a tad formulaic and on the lighter side, but look at her now! Easily the hottest transformation in TV history. Twenty years later, and she's still in the biz. Pity she never made it past the straight-to-cable flicks, but there's still plenty of time. Throw a good script her way, and see what happens.
