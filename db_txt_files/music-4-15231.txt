I love this album, although it does have some inconsistencies. Track 1 has a cool drum n' bass feel to it for variety but Track 2 sucks, it's some horrible synthesizier thing. Mercury and Solace is traditional BT, as is, Dreaming, the albums best track. Definitely try this out and also his album, Ima is amazing.
