I absolutley Love Kirk Hinrich I think that he is so great! He is such a hard worker and he knows the game inside and out...Just because your not black doesn't mean that you don't have game! Most ppl stereotype white guys b/c they are not black. I think that Kirk HInrich is a great basketball player. I also think that Kansas should have won if they made their foul shots.. I think that He will succeed in the NBA and I hope that he does!
