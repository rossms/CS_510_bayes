straight up one of the best cars ever built. right now it is the fastest car in the world, but Bugatti just came out with the Veyron, and its supposed to beat the F1 by about 25 mph. its also got 1001 Hp (the Veyron), so McClaren is going to have to kick it into high gear in order keep up. even if Bugatti does beat the F1, McClaren will always be known for having one of the fastest, and coolest cars in its name.
