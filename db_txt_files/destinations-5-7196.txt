Somewhat neglected and in need of renovation, this lovely capital sits like a Grand Old Dame on the hills overlooking the sea. The new underground train service is clean and efficient, the people friendly and the atmosphere timely and laid back. There is a fabulous 18 mile long beach at Caparica, a ferry ride across the Tejo river.
