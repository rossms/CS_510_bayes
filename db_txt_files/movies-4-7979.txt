Oh I loved that movie, at least when I was younger. Now thinking back: A husband that dresses up like an old lady so he can see his kids...no that does not really make sense. Where I am from we put those people in a home. But if you don't think too much about it you can enjoy that little movie very much. Especially the part where her/his breasts caught fire. That was hilarious.
