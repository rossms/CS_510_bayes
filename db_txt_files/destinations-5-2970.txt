The energy in the air is unmistakeable. There is so much to see and do here, though, you might want to plan ahead if you have certain attractions in mind; but keep some time open for the thousands of other things you won't discover until you get there. If you have a sense of adventure, this place is dynamic. I can't recommend it to anyone who is phobic of crowds, though. That's life in NYC.
