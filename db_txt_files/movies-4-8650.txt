DeNiro and Grodin, by themselves, aren't exactly the epitome of funny in my book. And I don't really associate the two of them together--they tend to specialize in two completely different genres. But these guys together in Midnight Run are flat-out hilarious. Some of the lines stick out in my mind years later. Not bad for a rainy weekend, or when you've exhausted all the new releases you care to see.
