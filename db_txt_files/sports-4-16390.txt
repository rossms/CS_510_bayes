He's a fairly good quarterback who plays in a system that makes him look better than what he is. Of course that system is appearing to break down now, and Garcia is not getting any better, so I doubt he has any Pro Bowl appearances left. Hell he'll be lucky to get into the post season again. Next year they'll probably get rid of Owens and he'll have very little pass receiving threats to make his reads to. Face it, he's mostly just willpower and is a good scrambler, but he struggles with the deep ball and is truly only accurate when throwing to short- and mid-range distance.
