He did an excelent job on senior day when he was put in. His defensive game was top-notch. I'd hate to see what the score wouldve been had his defensive game lacked just a bit. Manuel can play.. I hope he goes on to great things, and I will definitely miss him. (Oh, and congrats to him and his fiance'!!!)
