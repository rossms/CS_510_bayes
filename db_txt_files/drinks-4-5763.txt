It's good, but you can really only drink it once or twice before it gets somehow irritating on your taste buds. I used to be a former lover of the new vanilla coke but i have to agree: cream soda's better and the taste gets rather boring. Plus its about five times better in malt shops or restaraunts; this just seems like coke trying too hard to taste different. it succeeds but only for a few seconds before you go oh, wait a second; this tastes like coke .
