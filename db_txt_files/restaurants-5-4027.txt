I went to the Buca in Davie, Florida and it was Great! I do not agree that you must go with a big party. I went with 2 of my friends. They now have smaller portions that make it great for smaller parties. The shrimp parmesan is incredible and the garlic mashed potatoes are one of my favorites. The service was great and the staff was all friendly without be overly theatrical. I would def. go back with small groups or large ones.
