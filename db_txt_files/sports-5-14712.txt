A great story. Made huge efforts to get his teams to the super bowl only to be let down and get blown out. Eventually his team developed a real defense and not one for show. Plus he had a decent running game to take the heat off. One of the most skilled quaterbacks ever and deserving of those rings. Hard earned and too long in coming. Seems like a really nice man as well.
