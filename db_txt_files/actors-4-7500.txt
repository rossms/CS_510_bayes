The guy's got skills, I can tell. However, I haven't seen him at his best. I'd really like to see him in another type of movie (besides the romance comedies). He should star in a drama (and I mean hard core) drama movie someday. When he does, and I am convinced that he deserves to be in Hollywood, I'll come back here and change the rating to a 5 happily. Good Day!
