I don't think there is any denying that he is a good coach. And, you really can't fault him for leaving Tulsa (a team he molded into an Elite 8 team last year) for a Big Ten school which is a legitimate Final Four contender this year. However, I don't like how coaches like Self can sign big contracts with one school and then leave as soon as a better offer comes along.
