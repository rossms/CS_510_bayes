Has always been a good chew. Real Happy when they came out with Wintergreen. I do agree with the "To Many Stems!"statement. Some times get a bag that looks like floor sweepings from the factory? Are there any restrictions on the BEECHNUT BUCKS? I buy it aby the Carton and would like to know if you get full credit when you purchase a carton. I sure wish I could get my wife off of that EXSPENSIVE MERIT HABIT! Gentleman Red Neck
