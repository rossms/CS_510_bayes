Shaggy has been around for years. He has been singing professionally since the late 80s, and you can even hear his music on the Kid and Play movie soundtrack (forgot the name of the movie). 'Dance and Shout' is a really groovin' tune, one I can really dance to. 'Angel' is romantic (at least the lyrics are original) and 'It Wasn't Me' is hilarious. Shaggy is a breath of fresh air from this bubblegum pop crap like N'Sync and Britney Spears. It's time for some real originalty, thanks goes to Shaggy for giving it to us.
