It is the texture between a taffy/tootsie rolls/and now and laters. It has a unique taste of honey with a hint of peanut. They are good to chew (even if they are hard on your teeth) or suck. They are really good but how often do you really look at a candy rack and grab the Bit-o-honey? For me, not often. Too many other good choices.
