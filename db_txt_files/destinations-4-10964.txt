As a surprise for my 22nd birthday, my husband brought me to Kings Dominion in Virginia..one of my best birthday presents ever (I am a roller coaster fanatic). This is a great park with excellent roller coasters, a fun waterpark for kids, various shows and unusually good food for an amusement park. Not too pricey..an economical and fun filled day.
