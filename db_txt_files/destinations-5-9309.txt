Absolutely beautiful. Looking out over the north-western edge of Aruba, the California Sand Dunes are just great fun, especially for four wheeling! I rented a 4-wheel drive jeep while in Aruba and spent the whole day cruising the dunes. What's especially neat is that the dunes are basically right on the water, and if you aren't carefully, you could tumble or drive right into the ocean. I recommend this site to anyone!
