Dr. J was definatly one of the greatist of all time, you just look at some of his carrer highlights and you'll know. Did you see the way he jumped behind the backboard, then went around the entire thing and layed it up on the other side! Or how 'bout that sick rock the baby he pulled, there are moves he did that will never be acomplished again!
