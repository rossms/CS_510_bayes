Genny Cream is ... well it is, just so creamy. They used to have the little hand grebade bottles with the nice green and gold labels. This was a treat to drink back in high school compared to the Old Milwaukee. It is not really a creamy beer, I think that name is misleading. I am going back to MY in a couple of weeks and will get me some of these fine beers.
