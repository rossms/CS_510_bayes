I m currently one of 76 MBA Students in Lancaster University, one of England s best Business School in Research and Teaching by the way, we ll get the rest as well, don t worry -. It is amazing studying in a class with 22 different nationalities, being thought with complete relevance to practice, in a real nice environment with a lot of pretty cool students. I have to say that I m highly impressed with Lancaster University, the students and their quality of skills; it is definitely a good investment in your future.
