The best part of this film is the acting of the cast. Julianne Moore is vulnerable and beautiful as the paragon of a 50's housewife. Dennis Quaid and the supporting actors were also terrific. There is a wonderful, sad undertone to this film. Underneath the bright colors and perfect score, it shows the problems of the idolized time period that were swept under the rug. Issues such as homosexuality, biracial relationships (friendships and otherwise) and divorce. Too often parts of history are clouded by nostalgia and put on a pedestal. This film is a sad, beautiful, realisitc look at real life.
