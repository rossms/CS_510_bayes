I really cannot rate him for his movies since I usually see him in tv. I like him in Frasier as the snooty psychiatrist who works at a radio station. He has that nice deep voice and has done some good cartoon voice overs such as Side Show Bob in Simpsons.I have also seen him in a couple TV movies and he was good in those.
