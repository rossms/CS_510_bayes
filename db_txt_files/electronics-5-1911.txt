oh man the greatest system of all time. it blows away the newer systems today (xbox, ps2 ect..) and the games where awesome. this is my favorite system and i played it more than my xbox. it is the best and is still a classic. the classics always are the better ecspecially cenepede. i like super mario and chrono trigger the best!
