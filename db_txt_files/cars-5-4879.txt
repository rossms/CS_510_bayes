I had a GMC Sonoma for about 3 years before trading it in for my car. It was 4 wheel drive, but nothing fancy otherwise. I never had a single problem. It's V6 engine was more than adequate even when carrying a heavy load in the bed, and it rode comfortably and handled well. The air conditioning and heater did a great job. It was an extremely reliable vehicle and I would buy another if I were in the truck market.
