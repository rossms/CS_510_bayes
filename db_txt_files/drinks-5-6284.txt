Diet Rite soda's are the greatest. All flavors taste great. No calories, no sodium, no caffiene. and best of all none of that terrible aspartame. I am on the Atkins diet and have lost 30 Lbs. in 3 months. Diet Rite sodas are the best soda's to drink while on this diet. I wish more grocery stores in my area carried the Diet Rite brand.
