It can easily be understood why Jodie Foster was conveniently unavailable to make this picture. It was bad. This movie has gore for gore's sake. There was no reason for it. It was not a means to an end, and the story was missing the mysterious nature and circumstances of Silence of the Lambs. I like Anthony Hopkin's work, and was not disappointed in his work in this movie. But he is known for working if the price is right (not that there is anything wrong with that, I would too, but you can't use him as a good movie indicator).
