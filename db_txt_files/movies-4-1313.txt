I really, really was not impressed with this movie considering how stylised and visually impactive the first one was. Ok, the second filled in a lot of the gaps, but it was so tame, slow.... *snore* Considering she left the ones that she hated the most to kill last, I would have thought that it would have been even better than the killings in the first. God was I disappointed.
