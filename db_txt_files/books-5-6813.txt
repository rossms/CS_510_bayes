The original trilogy is a classic of Science Fiction by a master story teller. This is the story of Psychohistory and how it's founder Hari seldon keep the galactic civilization from going through a massive dark age. I have read the original trilogy a few times, the last time reading it through with all the prequels and sequels Asimove has written after then. They are not as good as the original trilogy, but are still well written in their own right.
