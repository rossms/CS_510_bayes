Despite the aspersions cast against this great man by the liberal intellectual elite and media, President Reagan will always stand as one of the greatest Americans of all time. He turned America away from what was essentially a socialist economy and brought forth an era of low inflation and strong economic growth. In addition, he beat the Evil Empire and he brought forth a new patriotism and love for our great nation. There are few president greater than he.
