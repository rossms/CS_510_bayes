Bibi is oneof the greatest politicans of this time. He did everything in his power to protect Israel. While he was Prime Minister the economy grew and Israel was safer place to visit or live. This man needs to be re-elected and get Israel back on track. He should be commended for all he did for his country. We very much respect and love him here in the U.S. If you want peace, elect Bibi again for a more stable Israel Paula Tilley P.O. Box 652 Scottsville, KY 42164-0652
