Bonds can take his game to the next level when he wants to. That said he's a piece of crap and bad for the game. He's obviously juiced! Take out a ballcard from the Pittsburgh years and compare that to one from 2004. Why does he need juice? Maybe it gives him 10 more feet.....man, he hits the ball a country mile anyway. What if they pitched to him???
