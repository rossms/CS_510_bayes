One of the best cereals out there. the flavor has remained consistent for years and thats a good thing. its nice and crunchy and has a slight sweetness. the peanut butter kind is very good especially for those who like that kind of flavor. the crunch berries arent so good. they taste terrible and dont add much to the cereal. to this day, the original is still the best.
