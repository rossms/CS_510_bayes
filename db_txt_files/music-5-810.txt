This cd is great. I have every single Goo Goo Doll album and I would recommend any of them to anybody. Every song on the album really means something to me, but my favorite song is Hate This Place. That song rocks. Their sound shows that they have really grown musically since albums like Jed-their lyrics are more meaningful and their playing sounds a lot tighter. Dizzy Up the Girl and their Hold Me Up cd are my favorites of all time!
