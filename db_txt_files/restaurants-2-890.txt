Not all that great or what it has been cracked up to be. The whole concept is boring to me now, and for most good sandwiches, I would rather hit the Quiznos anyways. IN my experience, the employees at these places have not been clean or sanitary, and I hate the smell of these stores as well. It really all depends on where you go, as is the case with most large fast food chains. I would much rather hit the Subways near a university or a college, as the college students tend to always give you bigger portions than if you go to a Subway in the 'burbs or in the inner city...
