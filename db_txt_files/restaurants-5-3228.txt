There is no better pizza than Papa John's. In fact, Papa John's was just rated No. 1 in customer satisfaction by the American Customer Satisfaction Index. Papa John's not only beat Pizza Hut, Domino's and Little Caesar's, it also beat all the other restaurant chains, like McDonald's, Burger King, Wendy's and Taco Bell. For my dollar, you won't find a tastier pizza anywhere else. (I'm getting hungry just writing this review.)
