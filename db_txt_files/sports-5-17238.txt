i base my rating not only on the five superbowls they have won but also the cowboys happen to be my favorite nfl team. however if i had to be completely objective a strong case can be made for the 49ers. just look at the similarities(qb) aikman/montana(rb)smith/craig(wr)irvin/rice(coach)johnson/walsh. i know both teams and players are ranked differently and played differently but the results were the same :superbowls. a total of ten between each club. however i give the edge to the cowboys. jay novacheck you will be missed.
