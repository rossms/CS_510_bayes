Meg is a good actress. I have liked in most of the roles I have seen her in. She has played many different kinds of roles. Usually she seems to be most known as the nice, likable gal type. I really liked her in Sleepless in Seattle.I have seen her in movies that I did not particulary like not because of her but because I did not like the plot or writing. There is a likability to her though. Not my favorite but an actress I am willing watch in a movie.
