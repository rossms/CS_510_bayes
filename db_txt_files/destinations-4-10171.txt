I just tried a menthol light, and I'm pretty new to cigarettes, but i usually smoke marlboro reds, and i barely get that lightheaded feeling, but for some reason after I smoked one of these, I was very lightheaded, almost sick, but more of a high feeling. However i did like the taste, i prefer non-menthol, but these werent overly minty so it was a good blend
