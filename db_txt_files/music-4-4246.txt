4 stars b/c it's The Beatles. but this is a collection undeserving of their cohesive overall output. the Red and Blue cds did a much better job. i understand there was a market for a single disc Beatles set, but why gimmick it w/1's, leaving out so many songs with much more credibility. doesnt make sense.
