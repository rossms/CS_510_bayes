New Orleans definitely has character; indeed it has a certain joie de vivre that simply isn't replicated anywhere else. The food, music and architecture make the place very unique. The French Quarter and the Garden District are must sees here. The suburbs are rather boring and the urban areas contain some of the highest crime rates in the nation. None of this however should deter you from visiting this interesting city.
