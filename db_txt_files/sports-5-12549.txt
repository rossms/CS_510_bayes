I am a buckeye, and people in Ohio generally hate Michigan - it's true. But I love the wolverines. Everyone here (Columbus, OH) and around the whole country knows what a great program and rich, proud tradition they have in Ann Arbor. Seeing it first hand, I speak the truth when I say that Ohio's hate for Michigan is only a mask for the jealousy and fear we have for them. Well, I will not hide behind a mask of hate any longer. This is one Buckeye who's ready to finally publicly acknowledge the University of Michigan's superiority.
