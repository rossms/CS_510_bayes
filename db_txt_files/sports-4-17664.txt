Chad Pennington stepped it up and led the Jets to the playoffs. IF he keeps studying and doesn't get cocky or arrogant, he should continue to grow. He's a bright young star of the league. I was excited about LaMont Jordan when he was drafted, but with a stud like Curtis Martin, he won't get much of an opportunity. Don't forget the defense or special teams. A complete team, but they just have to play complete games.
