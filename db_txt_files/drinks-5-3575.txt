This drink is strong and will knock people on their tush. It's a lot of alcohol for a very good price. My #1 choice for a bar drink. Personal preference- no tequila (though technically that would be a Texas Tea), extra sweet and sour. That's the perfect mix. Lot's of alcohol still, but easy to pound. LIIT = vodka, gin, rum, triple sec, equal parts sweet and sour and a dash of coke.
