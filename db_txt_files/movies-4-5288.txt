How hilarious is anubis' comment???? Seriously though, i like the movie but i dont think its even great let alone one of the best movies of all time. Ignoring the fact that the director was high during most of the filming (so rumor has it) and a dead writer was actually used on the set of filming, it's a good fun entertaining movie. Top 3 of all time? Nah.
