Tom Hanks is good in everything he does, and this was no exception. While I don't agree with his political views, his talent cannot be denied. Because of his enormous amount of solo screen time, this part was a real test of his abilities, and he passed with flying colors. This movie says volumes about the human spirit, and underwent great direction and writing. I was impressed. Additionally, I thought that the end answered enough questions without becoming tedious. Every scene has a very real quality, and it was definitely oscar worthy.
