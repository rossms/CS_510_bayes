The build up to What Lies Beneath's climax is slow, confusing and requires more than a little patience. Michelle Pfeiffer looks hot but I don't think that would be enough for me to recommend this movie to anyone. I'll put it this way, if you've seen the trailer you've seen the movie. Entirely predictable.
