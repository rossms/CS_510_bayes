Absolutely awesome state. The people are so down to earth. It has Nashville, the heart of country music. It has festivals everywhere. It has Knoxville, a great stop off I-75. It has Memphis, another great diverse city. This state has great values and exercises Southern Hospitality to the fullest -- I wouldn't have it any other way!
