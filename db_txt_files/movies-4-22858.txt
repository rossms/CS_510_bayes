I'm still a bit disappointed with the X-Men movies after seeing the cartoons when I was young, but this movie was pretty good. It was a whole lot better than the first one, which I thought was horrible. The X-Men's powers are actually put to use for more than 2 seconds in this one and more X-Men are introduced. The opening scene is really cool too. It's worth seeing.
