I hate to say it, but Mariano Rivera is a great pitcher. He has been an integral part of the Yankees' success over the last decade, and is currently their only pitching connection to their championship teams. Who knows how long he will be able to keep closing games for the Yanks, but he will probably go down as the best closer in history.
