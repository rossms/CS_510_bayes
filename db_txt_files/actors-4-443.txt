The old queen was a fine actor and the one film he directed, The Hight of the Hunter, was truly fabulous. Should have been given more of a chance to direct, but Hollywood has always been more about $$$ than artistic merit, and The Powers That Be of Laughton's time apparently felt he was not bankable in this regard.
