Interesting, but it drags far more than any other book in the series. Several seemingly unneccesary plotlines (SPEW, anyone?), and not much of a definite plotline. However, it introduces many things new to the series. I personally enjoyed Harry's overall crabbiness, it makes his character a bit more interesting. Some of the new characters like Luna and Umbridge are great. And Harry has a mission for the rest of the series with the Prophesy. Nonetheless, it seems like a bit of a fizzle after the fireworks at the end of Goblet.
