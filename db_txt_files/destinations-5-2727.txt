This city really knows how to party in the summer! They have great fests going on all around the city (blues fest, jazz fest, taste of chicago, country fest, gospel fest, latin music fest grant park symphony orchestra 3 times a week). These are all outdoor activities in the downtown park, Grant Park. Best of all these are FREE!!! Besides these activities, they have various neighborhood parties, farmers markets and art and craft fairs all over the city.
