Cant have these few people putting the Aston Vanquish at the top of the Pile of sports cars on just looks alone...the SC is undoubtably the best sports coupe made to date. As people have posted before, it still looks great 12 years on and there are not a lot of cars on the road that can match the ride, handling, power, luxury, and technical wizardry. Definately none that can at the same price. This car deserves to be at the top and should stay there until a better car comes along...that may be the Aston, but it should be decided on the car as a package - not on looks alone
