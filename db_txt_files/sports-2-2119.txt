What a joke their ownership is! Pohlad was willing to contract the team to make a buck. He doesn't care about the team at all. Easily one of the richest owners in all of sports and has only lucked out that they've had decent talent evaluation done at the minor league level. Look for the bottom to fall out eventually. Not really serious title contenders, lack of power for the AL.
