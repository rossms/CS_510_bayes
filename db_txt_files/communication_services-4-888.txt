The person who stated that they used the receipt for a rebate was a little misinformed. STi only provides rebates for new phones. Yes they also sell refurbs, but at a discount rate. Rebates do no apply to those. They sell the N400 not 440 but thats ok. Could have been a typo. However there is no way you sent in a rebate for that phone. STi is only offering rebates on LG phones.
