Much better than most other places. Keep in mind that the rating is relative to the other places on this list. Wendy's, as far as quality, service and especially prices goes, is lightyears ahead of McDonald's and better than Burger King. If I'm ever compelled to go to a fast food place (usually when I'm in a hurry), I'll try to find a Wendy's above all else. Their food is pretty good and the prices are reasonable.
