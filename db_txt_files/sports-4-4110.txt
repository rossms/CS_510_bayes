Was great in his day with Providence and Kentucky - authored the frenetic up tempo, spread the court, and bomb the three style that is so much fun to watch. As far as the reviewer who says his days are over... maybe you missed the tournament this year? Pitino brought a four seed to the final four. Still a young guy - I think he's 52? He'll be heard from again.
