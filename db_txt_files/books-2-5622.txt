This book was rumored to be one of the most hilarious novels ever penned in the history of man, which is, needless to say, quite a pedestal on which to place an artistic piece. This work did not attain to that status. I will be honest; it was only mildly amusing. The main character is a big, fat, lazy slob. I mean that in a literal sense, not in any derogatory manner. I was unsympathetic to his plight and therefore not particularly charmed by the entire proceedings.
