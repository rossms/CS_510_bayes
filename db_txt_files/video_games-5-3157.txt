The scariest game i've ever played. I can't tell you much about this game because i turned it of after a couple of minutes cause i couldn't stand being that scared. It's pitch black, you can't see, you're hearing weird noises, and the only warning you have of a monster coming is that scary radio. This game is disturbing the way the monsters look doesn't help. So before you play this, get plenty of sleep bacause you won't want to go to sleep.
