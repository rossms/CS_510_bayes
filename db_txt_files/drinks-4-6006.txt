I'm not afraid of having an Orangina once in while. The bulbous bottle and tangy, citrusy flavor make it a nice change of pace from soft drinks and sports drinks. I'm not convinced that it is good for you however... it definitely maintains a very artificial tasting flavor, not that that's a bad thing.
