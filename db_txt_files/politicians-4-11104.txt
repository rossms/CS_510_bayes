I don't know anything about this person, but I'll give him some props for independent thought - I'm always a big fan of politicians who are able to say what they feel, regardless of the party line. I admire McCain for it and I admire Zell Miller for it (even though I don't agree with his viewpoint). Ironically Louie, you are applauding in Zell Miller the very same quality that you bash in Abichara. Or are you just applauding Zell Miller because he agrees with you?
