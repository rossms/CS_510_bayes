I also agree with hermeslaw (I think). I'm thinking he is pointing out that Speedy distributes the ball well to his teammates (equipe is team in Spanish), but needs to penetrate more (probar). In addition (this is me now), Speedy is a fantastic defender - virtually impossible to get around, and stronger than you might think.
