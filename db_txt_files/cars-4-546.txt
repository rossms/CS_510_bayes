I've only owned an XR250L and felt it was under-powered, heavy and softly-suspended. However I've ridden XR100s, 200s, 250Rs, 400s, 600s and 650Ls. They are probably the most bullet-proof bike in the world. I would love to find an older 200, back when they had real suspension, as a spare bike. XR250Rs do very well in the east coast, tight woods terrain.
