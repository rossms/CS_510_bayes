Louisville has added alot more things to do downtown with the opening of 4th Street Live. The food, drink, and atmosphere is wonderful. The renovation going on in the city has brought the life back into it. There are many locally owned restraunts along Bardstown Rd. and Frankfort Ave. that have wonderful food.
