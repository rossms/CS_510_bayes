the 'action' was laugh out loud bad! (watch as the girls jump kick 30 feet, leaning backwards!!! hahahhahhahaha!!!) The plot reminded me of that kid who wore the helmet to school, and rode the short bus. It gets a 2 cause the girls look good (girl power?!? how about blatant exploitation of their, ummm, ass-ets?), and also a 2 cause I laughed so damn hard... Much in the same way you laugh when watching Plan 9 From Outer Space!
