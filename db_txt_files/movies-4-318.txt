Slow-going, yes, but the visuals were exceptional! Beautifully done, I think Joaquin Phoenix did a wonderful job portraying the whiny, spoiled-brat Comedus. Very dramatic (if you don't like drama, this isn't for you), beautiful cinematography. Not meant to be historically accurate. Beautiful musical score, too.
