Not a very well-known game, but loads of fun. A clown on a unicycle, on a tightrope between two buildings, had to balance balloons thrown by people in the buildings on his head. Occasionally someone would toss a bomb down. Watch out! (This was one of the crueller games, I guess). It was a semi-spin off of Pac Man. Pac Man and the ghosts made appearances in the game too. Hilarious and fun---the best track ball arcade game.
