I've never liked Doritos. They are edible and all but they are never the chips (or product in that class of snack foods) I will reach for. I have only tried the original (nacho cheere?) and Guacamole kind I think. Guacamole was really bad, didn't taste anything like avocado. My main problem with the cheese kind is that, to me, they just don't compare to cheetos or cheetos crunchers. Also, everytime I've had doritos I've found them lacking in crunchiness. They aren't stale but just not as crunchy as most other products.
