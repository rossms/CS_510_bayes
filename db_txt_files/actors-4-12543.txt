Out of all the 'teen' actresses, she's one of the ones that I truly think has potential. Grounded, intelligent and very talented, she has uncanny acting instincts and always seems to carry herself with grace. She was terrific especially in 'O', 10 Things I Hate About You and Save The Last Dance. I think she could be become one of my generation's best.
