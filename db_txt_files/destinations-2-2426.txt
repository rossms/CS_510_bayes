Atens is completely overated. When I was there (last summer) the Acropolis and almost all the other archeological sights were under major renovation/restoration, scaffolding everywhere which really detracted from the experience. The city itself was crowded and the Grecians attitude towards Americans was horrible. The Plaka, which is the old portion of the city under the Acropolis had its redeeming qualities, but overall I would say it was not worth the trip.
