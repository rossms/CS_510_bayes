This game is quite addictive and playing it with others makes it even more fun. It made me feel quite nostalgic for the good ole days of gaming. The music, the characters, backgrounds, are from Nintendo games through the ages. The replay value of the game is high because there are endless amounts of stuff (trophies, characters...) to unlock. Have fun!
