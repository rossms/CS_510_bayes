I was surprised and impressed by this movie. I had expected to want to leave early, but I became immediatly entertained by Brad Pitt's portrayal of an almost moron. Yes, the story was idiotic, but that is one of the attributes that made the movie funny. The movie becomes more serious toward the end, but I came away entertained.
