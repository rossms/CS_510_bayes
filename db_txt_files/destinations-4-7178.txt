Gawd it's filthy and very touristy but you have to love it. St. Mark's was great, even if it's 11 Euros for a slice of Tiramisu at a cafe there. I got lost in the streets and saw some great live music. I wish gondolier's would really sing like they used to: mine attempted to sing I Got You (I Feel Good) in Italian which was amusing, but there's nothing like a good barcarolle.
