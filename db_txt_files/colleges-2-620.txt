This law school has demonstrated egregious behavior in their admissions practices. I have often heard accounts where applicants applied to this school as a White/Caucasin student and were summarily rejected. When they reapplied as minority applicants, with the same scholastic record and lsat scores, they were granted admission. Of course, they have had their day in court regarding this matter.
