I got a kick out of Paris, because I realized people aren't exaggerating about the snob factor. Parisians can be jack-asses to us stupid Americans. At the same time, it was a great experience to climb the Eiffel Tower at night after a few beers. And I really like Van Gogh, so it was great to be able to visit the Museum d'Orsay.
