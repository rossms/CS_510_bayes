I am from StL and it is the best place ever. You can't judge it by the ugly railroad stations that you pass on the highway. By the way, for all you people that think it sucks and thats why people are leaving, you are wrong. St Louis is coming back HUGE! Not to mention St Louis challenged the u.s. census bureau which said st louis had massive population loss recently. Because of all the new housing going on stl realized that was impossible and won the case. You people overlook st louis too easily. This city has a bright future and people are beginning to realize it.
