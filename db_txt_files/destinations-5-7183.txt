Absolutely stunning. Yes the water smells during the summer, and there are a lot of tourists, and the city is a little run down, but Venice remains one of the most beautiful man made creations on the planet. It's architecture blends beautifully into its canals, and vice versa. It's piazzas are gorgeous - you have not experienced a romantic moment until you sit in Piazza San Marco, have a cup of coffee or a glass of wine, and listen to the sounds of classical music wafting up into the night.
