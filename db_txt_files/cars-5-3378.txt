This is an OFF ROAD VEHICLE and it outperforms every other vehicle in its class. You sure don't want it to take the little lady to the opera in. It rides nice but, the suspension is meant for rough terrain. I retired and bought a 5 speed 4.0 six for a second car. My wife and I have taken it places that we could never take a regular passenger car. When used for it's intended purpose it is the best on the market.
