My mom owns a 1999 Accord EX with the V-6 engine. 65,000 miles and not a single problem. It has tons of power, and it seems well matched to the smooth shifting transmission. Even though it only came with a 3 year, 36,000 mile warranty, you don't really need a long warranty with a new Honda because they are so reliable. Thanks Honda!
