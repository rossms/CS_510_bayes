The Dave Matthews Band seems to get a lot of bad press these days. The critics really tear them apart. I ve heard this CD described as morose and dawdling. My lack of music knowledge must be working in my favor, then, because Before These Crowded Streets was one of my favorite CDs from 1998. Sure I get annoyed by the hard-core DMB fans (generally college-aged women, it seems) who think DMB is the end-all-be-all of music, but I try to ignore that. With the exception of the overplayed Don t Drink the Water, I like all the songs on this CD, and I d recommend it to anyone who isn t already biased against DMB.
