I don't care for the cd much, but I did care about 'Liberate.' That song is worth buying the cd for alone. 'Waiting for your mother, Messiah, take away all the hatred that darkens the light in your eyes...Liberate your mind, your mother is narrow-minded...' The rest of the songs were OK, mostly mediocre. Innovation is missing, and Disturbed seems to be content with cruise control. Maybe they thought their fans would buy it just because it's got their name on it?? PLEASE. I only bought it cause of Liberate.
