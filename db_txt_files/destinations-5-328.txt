The only province in Canada which would pass as being an American State. Had an awesome time while there; very lively and fun! It's very multicultural, has almost half of Canada's population and is the business and entertainment center of Canada! On the flipside, there are some smog problems especially in the big cities but overall Ontario deserves my 5 stars. Thumbs Up Ontario!
