I've enjoyed Harrelson's performances from Cheers to Will and Grace . He is an actor who has proven that he can do both comedy and drama. I think that he was the perfect choice to play Larry Flynt in The People vs Larry Flynt for which he won an Oscar. He was also good in White Men Can't Jump and Will and Indecent Proposal . Woody is a good actor who has never in my opinion gave a disappointing performance, from Cheers to Will and Grace and everything in between.
