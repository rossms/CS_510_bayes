As a frequent off-roader, the Honda Passport is above and beyond the most capable sport utility I've ever driven. We have a '97 that has covered nearly every inch of the Colorado back country, including the fabled Black Bear Road above Telluride. The Passport sports some 4WD that just won't quit along with enough comfort to make long drives across the plains of Kansas a little more bearable. It's no Hummer H2, but that's because it's not afraid of a little dirt.
