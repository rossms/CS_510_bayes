I really love his cd. It has some powerful songs on it that you can really feel. IT lets some people know that even rock stars go through some of the stuff they do. My favorite song is Epiphany because it's very beutiful and it makes me cry sometimes. Also, the songs have a message. For example, on the song Take It , he's telling the fans that everthing that he says in the song won't help them because he's looking for answers himself. So if I were you, I'd go get this cd.
