Available for about $35-$40 USD. From www.migueltorres.com: Fine, dark amber-coloured. A deep, warm aroma, with traces of dried fruit and nuts. It exhibits elegant hints of spices and is round, intensely velvety and lush on the palate. An excellent Penedes brandy; aged at least 8 years. Rich, full flavor; very smooth and mellow. Most of the distinct bitter-sweet sherry flavors of the younger Torres products have mellowed out. Definately my favorite brandy for this price range.
