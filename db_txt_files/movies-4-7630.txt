Good movie. three men on a chaingang escape to they end up being involved in different adventures along the way.some are real funny. It is a Coen BRothers movie,so you never know what to expect, George Clooney is good, as one of the escapees, i love the fact that along the way they record a song for ten dollars a piece and it ends up a hit record!It is also neat how they happen on diffrent things such as being involved with a famous bank robber,etc. We enjoyed the movie.
