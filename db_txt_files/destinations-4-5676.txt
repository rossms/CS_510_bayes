This is a pretty neat place to visit. I've been going to the Cape since I was small and I never fail to enjoy mystay here. I prefer New England over any other region in the USA to visit. The history and the architecture of this gorgeous state are splendiferous. I feel real at home in one of the weatherbeaten, ramshackle saltbox houses on the Cape during the winter, when I can stroll along the frigid, windswept beaches, alone in thought. Massachusetts is terrific. Now that my brother and sister live here, there's even more of a reason to visit!
