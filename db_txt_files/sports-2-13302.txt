* This school gets an extra star for hiring a coach named Dick Offenhammer. * Buffalo made a huge mistake by advancing to division 1-A in 1999. This team is certain to return to a lower division very soon. In 5 seasons at D 1-A they have finished: 1999 0-11, 2000 2-9, 2001 3-8, 2002 1-11, and 2003 1-11. For a 5 season total of 7-50(.123). This is embarrassing to even rate.
