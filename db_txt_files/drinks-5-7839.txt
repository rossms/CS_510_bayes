This is a real mans whiskey. And joggleblggle..or whatever you call your self, good sippin whiskey was invented by the rednecks that your pissin on. I would not expect you to hang with a good southern boy. I also see a lot of folks wanting to ruin it with Coke. UGH! Dont get me wrong, I know thats a popular highball but all your doing is adding sweet to sweet! Jack has its sweet, nose warming thing going on already, and adding soda only takes away from what I want to taste..the whiskey. Give it to me right out of the bottle or give me something else!
