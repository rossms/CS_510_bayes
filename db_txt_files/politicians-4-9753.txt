He was not a bad president, but the economy was not good under his stewardship. However, I do think he has more substance and more brains than the current Bush occupying the White House. I'm rating him a 4 star primarily because I think he is a decent man with a lot of heart. He celebrated his 80th birthday by taking a parachute jump. After his jump, he said he wanted to prove that even if you're 80, you've still got a life. I was really impressed, and I think it's wonderful that a man his age still has a such a sense of adventure.
