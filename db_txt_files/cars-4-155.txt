I have a 1999 honda recon and it has been a very reliable atv so far.I got stuck in the mud real good once so i have equipped it with a superwinch 1500 and it gives me a sense of security. The only thing that i regret is that it is only a 2 wheel drive and it cannot perform in our canadian winter.Otherwise,it has been a good choice and my teenage daughter enjoys to ride it in the woods in Lac St-Jean,Qu√©bec.
