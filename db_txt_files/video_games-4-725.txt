This game can be very, very amusing when played with the right people and a little alcohol. The game is based around people making up mock definitions for words. These definitions are mixed with the real definition and read out loud at the end of each round - people who are able to write the most convincing definitions get to move their board piece towards the finish line. If you take the time to play this game, make sure that you are playing with literate, creative, articulate people.
