I'm biased. my hometown beer. local snobs will tell you it's junk, just b/c they are punks. but Iron City is a good beer. a lager, so it's thicker and darker than some. has a good taste going down, and no real aftertaste. Still goes down well, even after the Steelers choke AGAIN in the playoffs, or after another Pirate loss. i dont live in Pittsburgh anymore, but when i go home, i don't drink anything else.
