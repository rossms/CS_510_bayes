Olive Garden shouldn't even be considered real Italian. The pasta and the sauces are bad and the pizzas are even worse. The salads are the only things that are okay; the breadsticks are good, but going to a restaurant shouldn't depend on the quality of the bread. The entrees have to be good and at Olive Garden they clearly aren't.
