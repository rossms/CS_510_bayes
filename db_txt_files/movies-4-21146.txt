This really isn'y too bad, and you don't see it much now. It was a Broadway play that came to the big screen in the mid 1950's. Once a century a magical v village, Brigadoon, appears in Scotland and all kinds of good things happen. Two guys from New York wander into Brigadoon during is centennial appearence and a wedding is going on. This is serioux because the villagers know they have been discovered by outsiders. Gene Kelly, Cyd Charisse, Van Johnson, etc. are in the cast.
