This old cemetary makes for a great, interesting photo, with hundreds of headstones crammed tight against each other... I'd been reading a great book - A History of the Jews, by Paul Johnson - during this trip through Europe, about how Prague was actually quite hospitable to Jews (at least comparatively) during the renaissance era when the cemetary was built. I believe it was the first such Jewish cemetary in any major European city, though I could be wrong...
