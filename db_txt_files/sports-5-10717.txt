Larry Coker is an awesome coach! He is very nice and always makes positive comments about the other team whether we win or loose. Some other coaches say all negative things about the other team. I mean UM hasn't lost a game since he has been the head coach and we won a national championship as a rookie and is going for another yay!! GO CANES!!!
