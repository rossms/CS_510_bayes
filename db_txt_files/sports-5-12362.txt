For the people that talk about the call! Ohio State I recall was supposed to be like Nebraska and get blown out. Ohio State had twice as many penalties called against them than Miami.There was definately a penalty on the call . Maybe not pass interference ,but there was holding! Which is the same result, first and goal! Game Over Buckeyes Win! National Champions!
