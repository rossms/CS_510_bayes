San Diego has finally put together a good team. If everyone stays healthy they will will the division. If the pitching continues (they are 3rd NL and only Florida and LA have fewer walks, over 300 Ks, the staff has thrown the least amount of wild pitches in the NL, they don't give up bombs often - solid) then they'll be there in October.
