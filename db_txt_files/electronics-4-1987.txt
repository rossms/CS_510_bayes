Even though nintendo has had its bumpy rides like competing over PSone it has come back with Nintendo GameCube. Yes I know its recommended to people under the age of 10 it also has Resident Evil 0 and coming out is the rest. And with booming rates that Zelda The Windwaker has been making I think this Game System is going to be out alot longer. (And watch for FFC its coming out some of you know what I mean)
