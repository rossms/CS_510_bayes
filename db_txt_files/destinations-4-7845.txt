We had alot of fun at this zoo. The exhibits are wonderful and HUGE compared to other zoos. The african building is my favorite and a must see. They also have a Farmers Market there on Wends and Saturday which we browsed through. It was a great place to walk around and see animals. Food wasn't the best so I'd advise to bring a lunch. Traffic getting to the zoo was horrible, almost every road was under construction. If you can, take lake shore drive instead of Fullerton or North Avenue.
