This is probably my all-time favorite cookie in the world, I cannot believe it has such low appeal. The coconut, chocolate, condensed milk and cookie crunch - oh boy, I need to find a Girl Scout who is selling cookies right now. Come on people, I think most people have never even tried a Samoa because they are afraid of it. It is only a little innocent cookie.
