I have an Xbox. Before buying any system I compared the PS2 and the Xbox by looking at their technical specifications. Yeah, okay, call me a computer geek or whatever because I am a software engineer. I chose to buy it over PS2 for the very same reasons this author stated in a side-by-side comparison. Do some cutting and pasting with the following address: http://www.epinions.com/content_116590939780 The author forgot to mention that the xbox has a Pentium III processor. It is basically like buying PC.
