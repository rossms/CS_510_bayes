What have you done with the best flavored instant coffee ever on the market!!My friend and I cannot find the Viennese Chocolate Cafe and we absolutely LOVE IT!! Please bring it back or let me know where I can find it as no local stores are carrying it anymore. This coffe had the best chocolate taste and a little something extra that was fabulous!! Between the two of us we went through 5-6 8oz cans a week! Where did this wonderfully tasting coffee go? This product could not be improved upon except to put it in bigger containers. HELP!! I'm having withdrawal symptoms from the great taste.
