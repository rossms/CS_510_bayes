Lived here for 6 years and I have to say that it is a really good place to live - not great - just really good. lots of younger people living in town (20's and 30's) which means a pretty good night life and a wide range of social offerings. Seems like a decent place to raise a family in the suburbs also if you want to stay around a metropolitan area.
