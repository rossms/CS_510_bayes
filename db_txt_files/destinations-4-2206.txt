I really enjoyed my trip to Cambodia as well. As others mentioned, do not travel by road from Siem Reap to the Thai border - it is as brutal a stretch of road as you can imagine. Suck it up and fly. Angkor Wat is incomparable, and unique in the world. The Cambodian people are beautiful and friendly (and dirt poor). Phnom Penh is dirty and poor, but oddly charming. I'd go back in a second.
