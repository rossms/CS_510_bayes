Astonished is what I am. I know Jesse Jackson is human and a man. But I really thought in my heart he was different. To think that he counseled Bill Clinton and calls himself a Reverend just lets me see how corrupt this world is politically,morally and religiously.He has a wonderful family and supporters and to just blow all for a piece of young @??****is just not right Jesse. What do I believe in as a young African American female,mother and wife... NOT YOU!! We all have to be positive role models for our own children and teach them to be like JESUS because SOCIETY has none!!!
