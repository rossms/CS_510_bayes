People I've talked to who enjoy football enjoyed this film. I enjoy films about racial justice and the process of achieving it and I enjoyed the film, too. Denzel Washington made a terrific task master and seemed to have all the answers to making his newly diverse football team cohesive. The tactic of getting to know people as individuals was a success in the film as it can be in real life.
