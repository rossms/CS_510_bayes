He has substance, style, integrity, guts, honesty and morales. He will make a Great President! We haven't had any of the above in 8 years. We have had lies, deceit, immorality, selling out of the American public, and much much more. This is one American who is ashamed of the way Clinton has put this country in the toilet. Gore will just follow suit, cause he is nothing more than a democratic puppet. What a refreshing change George Bush will be. Go George B.!!!!!!!
