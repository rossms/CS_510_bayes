Another underrated U.S. city. St. Louis reminds me of Pittsburgh, only flatter. Nightlife at Laclede's Landing is fun, and the radio stations are excellent. On the downside, some of the highways in the area needs to be resurfaced. Also, judging by some of the comments I've seen on here, civic pride seems to be lacking, which is a shame because St. Louis is a good place.
