These bikes are bullet proof, look good, and DO NOT lose their value, contrary to other comments. Honda builds a great engine. I have owned several Honda MC's, including one 1100 Shadow. It was the best bike I have ever owned. Each used one I tried to buy this spring sold before I could get to it. So, while some may look down their noses at Shadows (made in the U.S.), they are deservedly popular bikes, low maintenance, sturdy, and fun to ride.
