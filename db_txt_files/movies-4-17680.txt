4 1/2 stars.Renowned for their dry minimalism and attention to small details,Robert Bresson's films are not for all tastes.(I've had mixed reactions,myself).However,this much admired depiction of a French Resistance fighter's painstaking attempt to escape from German prison,is gripping and hypnotic,and blessed with a purity verging on the spiritual.It is surely the director's masterpiece.
