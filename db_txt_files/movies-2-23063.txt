I thought this movie was so great when I saw it on the first day. Then I went home and watched the other Star Wars films, and I realized this paled in comparison. Sure, it has some beautiful scenery, and it gets a 2 for the Pods. But where was the story? The movie lacked the wonder and awe from the previous three. The Anakin kid was horrible, and I refuse to believe that a kid can just fly a ship that he has no knowledge in piloting, ans save the day. George hit a misstep on this one. Lucky II was a little better, but I'm putting my money on III.
