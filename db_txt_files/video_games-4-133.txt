It looks fantastic, and plays very well. However, the first one is probably better, not to mention a LOT bigger. This one doesn't throw you in enough perilous situations like you'd expect from a 007 movie. The trailer park scene is great, but after everything that got thrown at you in the original (falling out of a plane, fighting off multiple helicopters while on a ski lift, escaping a space station as it's falling apart, etc etc etc), I found this game to be a bit underwhelming. Plus, the goons didn't have enough conversations for you to eavesdrop on, and they weren't as funny as I'd hope they would be.
