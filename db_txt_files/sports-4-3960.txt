Are you really serious? Better than John Wooden? McGuire was a fine coach, but he was no John Wooden. For exmaple, his career winning percentage was 70.0%, Woodens was 81.3%. McGuire won 1 national championship in 33 years, Wooden won 10 national championships in 40 years, McGuire. I'm not a fan of North Carolina, South Carolina, St Johns or UCLA, but give Wooden his due.
