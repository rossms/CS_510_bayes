Long before Christina Crawford s infamous Mommy Dearest I could never stand Joan Crawford. She was just so bizarrely creepy with her thick black eyebrows, severe mouth, broad shoulders and mean gaze. To me she had all the charm of a really hateful prison matron. Her acting was also just so-so as well and in my observation she exhibited very little depth or variety. I think she had many, many personal issues that extended far beyond those we read about in that tell all book not the least of them being her complete and utter love affair with her movie star persona.
