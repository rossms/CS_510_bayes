Al Gore has been the greatest vice-president in decades. He is a brilliant and caring man. He has a vision for the future and will expand the prosperity to those who have not benefited from it so far. He is a great man it is time we gave him the credit he deserves! We are at the crossroads re: Social Security, the ageing population, race relation gender equity. Gore has the intellectual depth wisdom to be our leader at this point in history! Together we must create a better and more energized America!
