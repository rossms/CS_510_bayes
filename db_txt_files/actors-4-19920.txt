Buffy alone earns her 5 stars, but I have a pet peave. Why did she have to go blond? Aren't there enough in hollywood? There are so few brunette actresses at the top in her age group. I just resent that she fell into the trend. Scooby Doo was a bit of a let down for adults but she made up for it with The Grudge. The dangerous thing for her would be to take 2 bad roles in a row. I know we'll see more of her, I just hope it's good stuff. A Buffy movie wouldn't be a bad idea.
