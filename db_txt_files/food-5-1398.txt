this stuff is amazing! Its like a super intense sugar rush, the middle is pure creamy sugar enrobed in decadent milk chocolate. What more could you want? For Canadians, Laura Secord also makes a version of this treat but it is much more expensive and I don't really find it any better. Laura Secord's filling is firmer while Cadbury's is a bit runny which is not a bad thing at all. However, look out when you eat a Cadbury Creme Egg not to get it all over yourself
