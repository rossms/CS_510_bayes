Although it does dabble in sexual content, Mrs. Doubtfire is a warm-hearted and well-executed cross-dressing comedy from the comic that is mixed (sometimes his stuff is too raunchy), Robin Williams. Also, a great supporting cast and perfectly-executed slapstick make this one good for many. For safety, watch the edited-for-TV version on ABC Family. :)
