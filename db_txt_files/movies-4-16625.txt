This movie has no violence, which is refreshing. It's a story about a beachfront area in Florida thats about to be developed, in spite of protests from some of the residents. The pace of the movie is slow but relentless as the audience learns about several of the inhabitants of the town. It's fascinating, and thought-provoking.
