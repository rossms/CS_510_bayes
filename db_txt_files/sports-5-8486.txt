Kidd is the best pure point guard in the NBA. He has great size for a point guard and sees the court better than anyone else in the league. And, man, can he pass. His outside shooting continues to improve, but he'll never be a great shooter. But, on the Suns, he isn't counted on to put the ball in the basket. And that suits him just fine.
