The atmosphere is unique. The restaurant is an antique store and restaurant in one. There is often live music on Friday and Saturday nights, but it is quite and unobtrusive. The meals are also unique. You have to try the the tiramisu or the swiss and asparagus quiche. The parking is sometimes difficult and the space is bit cramped, but go on a weekday night and it is perfect with a bottle of wine.
