My 1996 Altima now has 306,000 miles on it, and I can count the number of repairs (other than routine maintainance) on one hand... actually one finger! I've only had to replace the alternator after about 250,000 miles. The car still has original exhaust, rear brakes, and battery (amazing, considering it's a Minnesota car), and runs like new. The car is solid as a rock, just put gas in it and change the oil regularly. I'm hoping to drive it for another couple of years.
