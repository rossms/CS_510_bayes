JDR is bringing a stifline defense to J-Ville. Check it out: after an 11 year NFL career as a linebacker, Jack Del Rio went into coaching. He was a LB coach and assistant defensive coordinator for the Ravens in their stifling defense Superbowl year. In 2002, he was defensive coordinator for the Panthers, resurrecting their defense from 31st, or last, in 2001, to 2nd in 2002. Quite an accomplishment. And now, lo and behold, the Jaguars will possess the best defense in the league next year! Prepare for an a$$ whooping, NFL!
