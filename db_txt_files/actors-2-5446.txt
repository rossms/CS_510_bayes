I really enjoyed Mike Myers as Wayne in Wayne's World. But then he had to go and do that movie called *54*! Now, because of that stupid movie, whenever I see Mike Myers I think of him as a drugged out gay whore. I can't watch his presence on the big screen anymore. This rarely happens, but in this case it did.
