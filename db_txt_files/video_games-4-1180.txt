I really prefer Rummy over Poker and Blackjack as, while there is a lot of luck involved, it requires an equal amount of strategizing and skill. You must put careful thought into, for instance, picking up cards from the pile that you may not be able to get rid of and could cost you points at the end. Overall, Rummy is a solid game that puts an equal emphasis on luck and skill.
