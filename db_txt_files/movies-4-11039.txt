Julie andrews was wonderful in this movie. i will never forget the first time i saw it. i was sitting on the couch at a friends house at a new years eve party and i could hardly take my eyes off the screen cause it was so good. i wouldn't give it a 5 star rating but i would give it a 4.75. close to 5 star material but not quite
