My rating is as a place to visit. Do NOT bring children (that is child abuse) and do NOT stay for more than 2 or 3 nights (more than that will lead to insanity). Lots of hilarious over the top attractions, and I like the dry heat in the spring and fall. I know some people who lived here and here's there advice- don't. Raising a child here is not a good idea. It's very seedy.
