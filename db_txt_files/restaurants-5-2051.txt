Like most reviewers have said, this is mainly a regional chain located in Texas,Oklahoma etc. What I like is you can actually order an item in a dinner where you get beans, rice, even chips and salsa. Makes it seem less like a fast-food place and more like a regular restaurant. The tacos are excellent, and they are very generous with the toppings.
