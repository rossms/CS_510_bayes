I don't thing this was one of Almodovar's best films but very entertaining and funny. He also did Tie Me Up Tie Me Down (also good) as well as few others that escape me right now. I think he also did Boca a Boca (pretty good). Oh he also did what have I done to deserve this this is interesting but if you're not into interesting and just want funny etc. this isn't the one, it has a lot of those hmm this is getting sort of odd moments . As for Women on the Verge..it was fun and I'd watch it again. Ah wait High Heels that was a good one toooooo.
