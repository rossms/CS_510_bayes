Dairy Queen brings back a lot of great memories... When I was growing up, my sisters kept horses at a barn about ten miles from our house, and there was a Dairy Queen right on the way. So we always stopped there on the way back for a quick Mr. Misty, Peanut Buster Parfait, or my favorite: a vanilla ice cream cone dipped in chocolate. If you're looking for a good fast-food burger, look elsewhere. But if you want a frozen dessert, DQ is the all-time best.
