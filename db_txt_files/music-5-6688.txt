Listen up people...you want good music? Then get the Infest cd by Papa Roach. They are an awesome band and you can totally feel the lyrics that Coby Dick sings. The whole band is awesome...Jerry, Tobin, Dave are great guys and Coby is a great vocalist. They've got great potential and talent. If it wasn't for these guys i don't know wheer i'd be. Not to mention Coby is a hottie.
