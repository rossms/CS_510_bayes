I like Mel Gibson. I have not seen every one of his movies but I have enjoyed him in the ones I see. He is a good actor. He can make me feel bad for him in the Man Without A Face. and laugh with him in What Women Want. He can be funny, dramatic, and that impish grin he has,well what can I say? He is not bad to look at for two hours either.
