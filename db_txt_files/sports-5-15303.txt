One of the best quarterbacks in NFL history. Even at this late point in his career he makes his team so much better. Winning games that otherwise would be lost and plays through pain. Worth at least +4 wins a year just by being on the field. Rarely the reason the team has failed to succeed. Every team wants to have a Brett Favre as their starting qb.
