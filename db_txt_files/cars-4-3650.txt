I have a 2000 Durango. It needed a new fuel pump at 1800 miles, but since then it has been great. It is a gas hog though, but we have the biggest engine and it is a very big and solid vehicle. I feel safe with the amount of steel around me. The inside is VERY ROOMY and comfortable. A lot of leg space. Storage space is very adequate. The features that are standard can't be beat. I can't wait until we get our next Durango. It is powerful!
