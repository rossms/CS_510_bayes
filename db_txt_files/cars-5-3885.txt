This should be the replacement for the Wrangler! Compass and Treo concepts are Jeep Scion type vehicles that are not going to cut the mustard with Jeep buyers. Look at the Commander sized vehicle they are going to build - THREE ROWS of seats! Put that Soccer Mom that needs something of that size on Birth Control! NOW! HUMMER makes a clown car for her already. Jeep won't produce this vehicle because the little guy with the mustashe back at the bunker in Berlin wants BOMBERS instead of JET FIGHTERS!
