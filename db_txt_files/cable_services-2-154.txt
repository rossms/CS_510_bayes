This is what I have at the moment, but I'm probably going to switch pretty soon, for several reasons. First, from what I hear, dishnetwork is cheaper. Second, you can now get local channels in my area on dish and you can't on directv. Third, the least little bit of rain at my house causes the reception to go completely out, while at the same time my mother has dishnetwork at her house and it can be pouring down in buckets and it doesn't affect reception in the least.
