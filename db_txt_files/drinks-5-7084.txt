Totally unobtrusive taste. Clear as a bell. I found Grey Goose to have a bit of a bitter tang (and the lady selling it to me said the extra money GG charges is probably due to the fancy bottle). I suppose I should try more vodkas to dole out a 5 star... but so far, Stoli is far superior to GG, Finlandia, Absolut, and Smirnoff (I found GG and Finlandia identical).
