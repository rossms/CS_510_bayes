not a fan. when i visited california, my family went there twice, and the second time it made me sick. went right through me. when i ate weinerschnitzel and krispy kreme hours later, it just aggravated it. at the time, the burgers were pretty good, but the whole place looks slummy. plus, the character, Jack, really creeps me out.
