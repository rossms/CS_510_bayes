I think he;s just a great comedic actor. Okay, Serendipity did indeed suck bigtime, but he at least tries to make his character, if not te film, as good as he can make it in his power. I really liked him in High Fidelity, just because he ws such a... guy. He didn't seem like someone who came out to do a part and said Okay, I'm gonna make my money, I just gotta go recite these lines and I'm done but he made it sem like he was just some poor schmuck that was completely out of luck.
