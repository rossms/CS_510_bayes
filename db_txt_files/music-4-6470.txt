A step down from their first and second albums, but still the last stand of bad-ass rock before candy-pop took over the charts. "Maria" is a terrific track. . .listen carefully for the very-underrated Tom Morello on guitar. Much has been made of the bands politics, which I find strange. Of course they are politically naive, but the music is too powerful to ignore. Although I am glad they broke up before they started to fade, the bland world of PC-safe pop music needs their sonic blast more than ever.
