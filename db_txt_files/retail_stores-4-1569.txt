Penney's is getting better all the time. They are having many more sales than they used to, and they aren't so high on their clothes. One thing keeps them from being five stars. Whenever they have any kind of sale, certain things are always inelligible for discounts (Levi's jeans for instance). I know for a fact that Mervyns doesn't exclude Levi's from their sales, which is why I spend more money there than I do at Penneys.
