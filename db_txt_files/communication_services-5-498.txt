I have had a number of different cellular providers and my experiences have all been the same. For any rational person it is easy to understand why Alltel struggles in certain areas. ALL cellular providers do. Depending on your phone, where you live, and the location of towers everyone will have a different service experience. If you can't handle that than do not get a cell phone. Reading some of the complaints that people have written no wonder Alltel has bad customer service-look at the idiots that they deal with.
