As far as chocolate goes, nothing can match the flavor of a Hershey's Chocolate Bar. As an adult, I have tried all kinds of fancy imported chocolate, but I still prefer the taste of Hershey's. It has the ideal balance of cocoa flavor and richness without being too heavy. I'd take a Hershey's Chocolate Bar over Lindt, Godiva, or Ghirardelli chocolate any day.
