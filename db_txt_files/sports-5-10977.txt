Shutup you idiots! Houstion Nutt is a great coach! I watch all of his games and I live in Alaska! come on you have to admit as much as I love Matt Jones it was not a good idea to come back this year....Arkansas just didnt have it this year mostly in part by early entry to the NFL and ONE ONE! returning starter on offense. thanks yall peace
