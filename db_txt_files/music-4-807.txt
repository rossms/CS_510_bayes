 Iris was the first Goo Goo Dolls song I ever heard, and my initial reaction was that the band sounded kind of whiny. After a while, though, it grew on me. I really liked several other Goo Goo Dolls songs that were played a lot on the radio ( Slide, Broadway and Black Balloon ), and so I checked out Dizzy Up the Girl, which has all of the hits. The CD is pretty good overall, although a few of the tracks are a bit too loud and rambunctious for my taste. If you like what you hear of the Goo Goo Dolls on the radio, I'm pretty sure you'd like this CD.
