Though the movie had two major flaws (a rushed and choppy editing job and the love story between Damon and Cruz--you never fully believed the two were in love and the movie didn't go in depth enough on the relationship for there to be so much focus on it), I found the movie thoroughly enjoyable. The relationship between the three male leads (Damon, Black and Thomas) was great, particularly Lucas Black's portrayal of Blevins. The character was very interesting and fun to watch, and Black's wonderful acting skills seemed to bring the movie to life. I see an Oscar in this kids future.
