I own a 1995 windstar with the 3.8 engine, its a wonderful vehicle if you overlook the headgasket that went out at 65,000 miles that I had to replace. At first Ford was very rude and wouldn't help at all. Now they are attempting to resolve my problem, but as of now, I'm out over $850.00 and in the process of litigation.
