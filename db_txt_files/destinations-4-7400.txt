If you go to Paris, make sure you take an umbrella, use the public transportation instead of walking everywhere, and eat at restaurants off the beaten path. Paris is bigger than you will think, and trying to walk to all the attractions will get you tired while not seeing very much. I've learned the French are actually very nice people outside of the touristy parts of Paris. I had a waitress actually translate an entire menu to me!
