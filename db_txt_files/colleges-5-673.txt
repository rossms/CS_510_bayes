I do not understand how people can rank Vanderbilt Law as BAD. It is a top ranked, natioally acclaimed Law School that produces some of the smartest and most talented graduates out of any law school in America. It's interesting how people can give a low ranking while not making any comment about an institution..it's as if bias is just coming forth and people have nothing to back up their negative opinion.
