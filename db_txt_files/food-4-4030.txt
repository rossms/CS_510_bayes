i figured i'd split the difference: love the cheese ones, but i'm not so fond of the ranch, and i don't know why they even make that 3D stuff: i don't like the whole texture of them. if i want some kind of almost cheese puffy snack, i'll get cheese puffs. i know they're making all kinds of new flavors, and i like some of them, but i think my favorite will always be the cheese, even if you do have to wash your hands and brush your teeth right after eating them.
