I thought I wouldn't like this movie, since I really don't like flicks specifically designed for teens, but this was actually a pretty funny movie! It was sweet and kinda heart-warming, since the shy guy finally got the girl of his dreams. And Seth Green...whew! He is so hot! I just wish I was the girl who got locked in the bathroom with him! Anyways, a hilarious movie with a happy-ending...very nice!
