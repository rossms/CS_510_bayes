Pittsburgh is a great city! All of the different neighborhoods make the it very attractive and unique. Downtown is so easy to walk from end to end. Plus, the city parks are wonderful and the city is filled with green during the warm months. As for the people who give Pittsburgh a negative rating, obviously you are not from around here and have too much pride for the city you grew up in. That is fine, but don't bash our city with knowing little about it.
