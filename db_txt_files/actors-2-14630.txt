The saddest thing about Courtney is that there is some talent there and its going to waste. I've seen her in two amazing films Man on the Moon and The People VS Larry Flynt and she was good in both of them, two completely different characters. Another thing that saddens me is that she has a beautiful daughter, if only she'd stop living in the past and kick that filthy skanky drug habit she will actually find she has a lot to live for.
