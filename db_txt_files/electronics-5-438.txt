I love Tivo and like dharmamomma said we will never watch TV the old way again (and like it. There is only one thing wrong with it; it doesn't have a direct connection with our digital cable so sometimes the channel doesnt change and we miss our show! That really sucks....:( Other then that its pretty great.
