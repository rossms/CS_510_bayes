I have owned my SUV for 2 years, runs great SUPER stable and I can carry everything I need. It doesnt handle badly, it is large but that is what I like about it, wont tip over but you can jump and do sharp turns with ease if that is what you want to do. It is Very comfortable for long all day rides. Good power. Will do around 58 honest MPH.
