I was born there and rum Don Q is what we all drank since little, we never even bothere trying other stuff until later and we always went back to Don Q. It was not only the cool and popular rum but it was just plain good, every foreigner that came over here they always asked for all sorts of stuff but once they tried Don Q, they would buy bottles bcs not only it was cheap but it was the best to mix with just regular coke or a nice cold lemonade, so drink up if you can find it outside Puerto Rico, Salud!
