Melbourne is an amalgam of everything good you'll find in many US and European cities. Great public transport in many forms, and the shopping and food is world class. There is beautiful old architecture set amongst some of the worlds biggest and most striking modern skyscrapers. The people are cosmopolitan (Melbourne has the biggest Greek population of any city except Athens) and friendly, and unlike much of Australia, Melbourne actually has seasons! Don't forget the coffee, which is better than world class!
