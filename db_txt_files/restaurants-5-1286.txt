It is my first choice for a chicken sandwhich: I fell in love with them when I first discovered them as a teen way back when and now-more years later than I care to recount-it is still my favorite chicken sandwich and it hasn't changed a bit-now that's gotta tell you something. I don't get the roast beef much since I always need the chicken when I go there but it's pretty good too and I cannot eat the roast beef without Arby's sauce. Those are the only two things I get on their menu besides the occasional potato cakes.
