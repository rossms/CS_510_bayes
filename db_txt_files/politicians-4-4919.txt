He seems to be an honest and well-intentioned man. I do commend him as of late for not steering away from his opposition to the war. As the Democratic leader in the Congress, he helped steer the votes for President Clinton's 1993 Economic Plan which led to the longest period of economic expansion in history. He seems far too liberal to win the Presidency, but he does seem to be a good man.
