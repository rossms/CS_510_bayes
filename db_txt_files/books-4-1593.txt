It was hit-and-miss. . .but when it was "on" it was a funny comic strip that shot an arrow into the stupid 80's era of clothes, music, politics, and the general decline of literacy and intelligence. . .there was great critical commentary to be found in this comic strip that simply went over the heads of people that were too busy living in the 80's to really notice. . .it wasn't perfect- sometimes it reached too far, but Bloom County was good while it lasted.
