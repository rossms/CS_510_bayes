An excellent depiction of the life of the Last Emperor of China. Regardless of this movie's basis in reality. It is believable. The sets are dressed exquisitely, and the plot is without question superb. The viewer can feel the emotions of the characters, and feels empathy toward them. The movie is a bit longer than it should be, and the director's cut is even longer, but it is definitely worth a look.
