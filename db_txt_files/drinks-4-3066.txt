Tastes like crap, but what a great mixer for alcoholic drinks. While I would imagine that this stuff can not be good for you, it definitely gets you going... your heart starts pounding, your eyes open a little wider, and you just feel more alert. My personal favorite is Red Bull and Vodka, though I have been known to have the occasional Red Bull / Tequila - which really tastes like crap.
