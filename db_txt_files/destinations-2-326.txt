This may be the capital of Australia but it is also the capital of boredom. Unless you're absolutely fascinated by the inner workings of Australia's parliament (and even I, one who is very interested in politics cannot stifle yawns here) or find something of interest in Australia's bland and uneventful history, then you should avoid this city (if you can call it that - it's barely distinquishable from an enormous park).
