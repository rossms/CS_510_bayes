I love Target, and always find more than I actually need to buy when I go. The stores are clean, well organized and the merchandise is usually better quality than other discount stores. I buy most of my son's clothes there, because the styles are current, and they seem to not wear as quickly as the cheaper brands. The only thing that I don't like is if its not on sale, then the paper products/personal care products are higher than Walmart. However, as far as a shopping experience, its much more pleasant than Walmart. And their clearance prices are always great!
