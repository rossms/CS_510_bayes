I feel that the republican party paid off Ralph Nader to steal votes away from AL Gore.Because look at it this way you know Ralph Nader does'nt have that kind of money to produce the campains and votes from all the people he got them from.Because the elections in Oregon and all the other states were Al Gore was neck and neck with George W. Bush.Al Gore lost those states because of Ralph Nader if you take the votes that Ralph Nader got and if he was not running most if not all of them would have went to AL Gore. Ralph Nader claims to be with the independent party but why is he showing republican ways.
