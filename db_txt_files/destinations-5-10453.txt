What can I say? When you really want a punch of smoke, there's nothing better than Newport 100s. They've got the highest nicotine/tar content over any other filtered brand, and I smoke them for just that reason! I'm very grateful. Contrary to popular belief, there's no fiberglass in them, but there are all sorts of wicked ammoniates. Keep 'em coming!
