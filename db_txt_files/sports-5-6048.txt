Do you remember who Allan Ray was this summer? He was the guy that was on the same summer team as Redick (one of the more over hyped players in college basketball) and made JJ look like a chump. Well, Randy Foye is his teammate - the guy that carried the US flag for that other US basketball team (the one that won the championship), except he is the better of the two. Where does that leave Reddick then.
