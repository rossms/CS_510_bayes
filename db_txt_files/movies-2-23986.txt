This movie is fairly saddening as a whole but it warrants a 2 for decent acting and decent special effects. It's saddening because the parents ditch the robot for no reason and the Blue Fairy part is incredibly far-fetched. The persecution of robots makes no sense to me either. The ending is 'happy' but it is a little dumb because the robot can only have his 'mother' for one day. I'm not sure what Hayley Joel was thinking when he acted in this one, even if big-time director Steven Spielberg directed it.
