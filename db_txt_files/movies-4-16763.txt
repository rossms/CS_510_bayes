A sensitive,pleasing,unpretentious little film about a young Welsh boy whose parents are separated,who is befriended by his eccentric piano teacher,and who believes in healing by Faith.The 2 Welsh foreign language Oscar nominees in the last decade -the appealing,lyrical Hedd Wyn and the worthy but drab Solomon and Gaenor- were overlooked in Britain,so i'm again glad to see(the English language)Taliesin Jones has had the cinema release in America it failed to get here.
