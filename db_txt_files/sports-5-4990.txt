I give Pete four star. he was the best shooter to walk on the hardwood. he had to be. There was little if any support from the other 4. It was MUCH tougher to make the NCAAs in those days, so i take that knock against him with a grain of salt. If he played on a medern day Duke, he'd average near 30/game becaus ehe'd be forced to play within a controlled offense. I would argue he was the best guard ever in college.
