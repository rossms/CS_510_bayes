Dre is an awesome player!!! Even when it is an important game and everything is on the line he always comes thro under pressure. He can run and receive like no other player i have seen. I have seen nothing close to him since edgerrin james(5). I cant believe he isnt higher on the list. Dorsey and Dre work great together.
