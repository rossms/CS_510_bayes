Continental is hands down the best US airline. Their frequent flyer program is outstanding. I get upgraded almost every time I fly Continental. Unlike most carriers they serve food on almost all their flights. And believe it or not, I have actually met some friendly flight attendents on this airline. Newark airport ( continentals hub) is very clean, modern , and easy to get around. Kudos to Continental for being one of the few shining stars in an otherwise terrible customer service industry.
