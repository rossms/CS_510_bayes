Good fries and shakes but the hamburgers have gone downhill some. They're not as good as Burger King's. Also, McDonalds needs to hire more adult employees 18 and above, not young teens 14-17 who act rude and inexperienced. Update-McDonalds are now turning into filthy hellholes with nasty rude teenage employees, filthy restrooms, and filthy dining rooms as well as absent-mined employees who never wear gloves or wash their hands when handling food.
