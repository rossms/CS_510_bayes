Boy you guys are tough on us hillbillys! I moved here from the great state of TEXAS, and I love it! There might be a few rude people,,,but I haven't met an yet. We are kinda backwards here,,we don't lock our cars, or our houses. We let our kids walk to school, and they can trick or treat anywhere they want. We still pray before our football games, and the American flag flys all over this state. You can still sign a little book for your groceries at the store and come in a pay for it on payday. I'll take the backwards any day! I guess we're not all backwards....we do use computers! Ya'll come see us!
