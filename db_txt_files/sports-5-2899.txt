Babe Ruth was one of only two people to hit three home runs in a World Series game. He played 163 games as a pitcher with a wining percentage of 67%, which makes him one of the best left-handed pitches the game has ever known. He was also the outstanding outfielder of his time and one of the best in baseball history. But even with those things, he was more known as a home-run hitter because in 1927 he set a record for hitting more than 60 homeruns in 154 games! In his lifetime he had 714 home runs in regular-season play. He is one of the greatest players of all time.
