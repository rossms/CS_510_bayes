Owned a 1997 Dodge Ram SS/T, emerald green, right off the showroom. It was my dream vehicle and I loved it very much! The only reason I don't have it today is that I have two large dogs and I like them to ride in the front. The SS/T was a single cab, so it lacked the utility I needed. Very fun to drive!
