Their burgers are better tasting than McDonald's, and they're bigger, which is a big plus for me. Their fries are improved, but they're not McD's fries. I don't like the way the employees actually handle the food with their bare hands though, who knows what kind of germs are crawling on them. Put some gloves on! If I had to pick BK or McD's, I'd probably choose BK, and not because it's right across the street and McD's is down the block...they've got better burgers. If I could pair up a Double Whopper with a supersize order of McD's fries, that's a meal that just can't be beat.
