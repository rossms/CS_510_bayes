I was the Fry and Frosty Girl at the local Wendy's for 3 days before getting a better job at the local brewery (I was young and preferred the perks of the brewery rather than a discounted single with cheese value meal). Anyway, I think it says a lot about a fast food joint when a former employee still loves the food. I never made it to Sandwich maker however I can attest to the fact that everything was freshed and prepared well. Can't beat a good old single with cheese, biggie fries and a frosty..mmm mmm good job Dave!
