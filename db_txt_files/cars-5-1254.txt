Very impressed with our new 2003 Altima. Good looking, roomy, and very comfortable. Rides and handles well. Very peppy 4 cyl. My daughter has a 1994 Altima which has given her great service and still runs great. The 2003 is a bigger, more refined model. If the 2003 holds up like her 1994, we're going to love this car.
