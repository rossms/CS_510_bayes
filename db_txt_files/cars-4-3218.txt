We've had a 2000 Grand Cherokee since it was new and it's nice ride. The V8 tows anything, and it is as refined as anything on the road. We did have a new transmission put in (under warrantee) after the first 6 months, but trouble free since then. For the cost it's a nice SUV, especially if your on the road with a 4x2.
