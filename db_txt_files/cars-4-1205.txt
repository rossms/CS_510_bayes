My car is a 1997 model but I bought it from a dealer secondhand in 2001 with 66,000 miles. The dealer apparently gave me a good deal but I wasn't to sure with the color. Now I'm not too worried about it. The car runs great, gives good gas mileage, and has had some repairs for brake replacements, etc. Now it has 125,000 miles.
