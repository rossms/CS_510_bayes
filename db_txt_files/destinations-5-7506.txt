I actually spent 3 weeks here on business and loved it. It is clean, very quaint and has personality. The palace was really beautiful and I also visited Princess Grace's grave. She is buried in the Catholic church on the grounds of the palace. Very pretty country, the only thing is after a few days I was getting tired of eating so much pasta.
