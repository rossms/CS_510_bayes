I've been to Chick-Fil-A restaurants in several cities. I have yet to encounter an employee there who wasn't polite, well-mannered, and dressed in a clean uniform. That has to originate at the top. The chicken is tasty and always well prepared. I know it's not the healthiest food on the planet, but I like it. Substitute the small fruit cup for the fries and drink the diet lemonade if you must.
