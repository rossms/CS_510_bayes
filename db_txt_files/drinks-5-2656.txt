This coffee is, by far, the absolute best of the major national brands of coffee. Sure, there are other coffees out there that rate a five - and they cost four or five times as much as the Folgers Gourmet Supreme. This is rich, dark coffee that is great for breakfast and compliments any desert, especially chocolate. It's inexpensive enough to serve everyday, yet rich enough to truly enjoy.
