I think Tom Cruise is excellent in this film. Dustin Hoffman does his little autistic shtick (influenced, by the way, by the die hard Yankees fan guy who memorized the card catalog at Princeton's Firestone library), but Cruise's character is much more nuanced. A fun watch when its on TNT or whatnot.
