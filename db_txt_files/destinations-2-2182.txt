You can't actually rate Indonesia. To make a fair rate, you have to say what island or city you're rating. If you're talking about Jakarta, then I'll probably rate it as bad (2). There's nothing you can see there, except for the always-jammed streets. Avoid Jakarta. If you're talking about Bali or Lombok, then I give a 3 or 4. Be careful when traveling there nowadays. There have been a lot of riots.
