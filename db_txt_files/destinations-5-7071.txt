Having been to Dublin twice in the past 5 years I can assure you that Dublin has become one of the most cosmopolitan cities in all of the western hemisphere. Dublin still maintains its cozy, warm, and inviting personality, yet is very much a modern city well on its way to bigger and better things. While any city growing as fast as Dublin has will be subjected to the usual growing pains encountered when the infrastructure lags behind the population boom, Dublin has a unique sense of self that can not be denied and is worth a lengthy visit.
