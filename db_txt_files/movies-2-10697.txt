The funniest thing about this movie was seeing how perplexed the film industry was by it: how could Sandler be making movies with $20 million budgets and earning $100 million plus at the box office alone? In actuality, its not nearly as good as Billy Madison or Happy Gilmore. It's slightly fun to mimick the character after the movie's over, but a little painful to watch for 90 minutes. I wish Adam had stuck closer to his (non-Cajun) Canteen Boy character from the old SNL days. Those skits were hilarious.
