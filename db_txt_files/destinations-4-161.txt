You should definitely visit Singapore. It's clean and beautiful. The food is marvelous. Don't forget to visit the food centers, such as Newton and Tiong Bahru. These places are one-of-a-kind. Oh yeah.. be sure to watch the rules there. Singapore is really strict. If you made a mistake, they'll fine you big time!! It's afterall a FINE city. :P
