The Gap and the whole Gap Inc. which includes Old Navy and Banana Republic GREAT! I love everything that I have ever bought at the Gap. Most of their styles stay for quite awhile. Favorite product? Definetly their ribbed turtlenecks they bring each fall. I probably have 20! The only thing I do notice is that their black cotton fades very quickly. Otherwise, two very enthusiastic thumbs up!
