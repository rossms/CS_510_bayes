Coach Chaney is reaching the twilight of his career and probably never was the best offensive coach in the world. But he does more with less talent than any coach I can think of and watching great teams fall apart in the face of the matchup zone is a pleasure year after year. Moreover, he is a great mentor and teacher who is revered by his former players. He has turned down better offers to stay where he feels he can have the most impact. There have been a couple of dry years recently, but the 2004 team should be back in the NCAA tournament and nobody will want a piece of them.
