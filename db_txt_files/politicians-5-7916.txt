Truman was a great president, our current prosperity today would not exist if it were not for the GI bill which allowed veterans of WW2 to get an education which allowed these people to work in various industries which allowed for long-term growth in the economy. He deserves more credit as a great president than he receives. His foreign policy effectively ended WW2; dropping the atomic bomb showed the world that these weapons should never be used again. He also brought together many good, qualified people to work in his cabinet, which more than made up for his lack of knowledge.
