Finished last year with 27 tds, too many picks, and one bird flipped. Options to throw to seem a bit thin and Shanahan may have lost his mind when he dealt Droughins and drafted Clarett. Jake has a rough time ahead of him but I still have faith. ROUGH TIME: I will eat my own words. Rod is Rod and Lelie seems to be emerging (finally!). Shanny got rid of that dead weight Clarette and is using Bell and Anderson (a real life Jarhead!) effectively. Jake has brought it all together as I knew he could and hasn't thrown a pick in four games! He dropped in two purty deep balls on the Pats and I almost cried.
