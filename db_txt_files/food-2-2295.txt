Dove chocolate is highly overrated. Hershey's has always been better, and the only reason why Dove has such a good reputation is because they want to have a good reason to make it more expensive. When I eat this chocolate, I don't see anything in the texture, the taste or anything to make it seem better than Hershey's chocolate. Just a gimmick to create better sales if you ask me. But I could be wrong....
