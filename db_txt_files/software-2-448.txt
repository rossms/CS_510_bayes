I have five computers; one with Windows 3.1, one with Windows 95, one with Windows 98, one with Windows ME and yet another with Windows XP. Of all the systems that I use, ME is by far the worse operating system. I have not fully tested XP out yet, but thus far it is operating great. One of the main problems with ME is that it does not play well with others. That is to say, that even if something says it will run with ME, it might or it might not work.
