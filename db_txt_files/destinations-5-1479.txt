If you ever get a chance to visit Costa Rica, take it! Its one of the best vacations I've ever been on. Not only are the beaches warm and beautiful, but they have some of the best and beautiful rainforest hikes, wonderful zipling trips, and bridges that let you see the canopy of the rainforest. They also have other ncie things like hummingbird, butterfly, and botanical gardens. It also has a real cool active volcano, as we were driving by we could see erupting on the otherside of the lake!
