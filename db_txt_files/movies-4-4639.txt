Which one? The one from 1993 (gets a 3) or the one from 1949 (gets a 5). Since I don't know which one I'm rating I'll settle for a 4. The 1949 version is so moving, well acted and beautifully shot whilst the 1993 version has a lot of unconvincing acting, a ligther mood and a less sour note to it. The one from '49 captured the essence of the book whilst the '93 version transformed the storyline so that it would be better suited for children. I love the book and both adaptions are well done, but I'd rather watch the one from '49 because it tells the story closest to the book.
