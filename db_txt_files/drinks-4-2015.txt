Arizona green tea has a pleasant, crisp taste. I prefer the diet green tea over the regular green tea. The diet doesn't leave your mouth thick and gooey. Green tea is wonderful period. I drink two cups a day and haven't had a cold or flu in almost two years. There have been a lot of studies done on green tea and it's medical wonders (although a lot of the studies aren't yet proven), but regardless, I'll never stop drinking it.
