they have good flavor for an ultra light. they really take me back because i started on the ultra light 100s. ah yes, that day way back when i was 16, i told my older sister that i wanted to smoke, gave her some money and she came back with merit ultra light 100s and a lighter. well, two and a half weeks later i needed another carton. i smoked them for about a year.
