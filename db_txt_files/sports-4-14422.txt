More skill than Montana perhaps. Currently ranks ahead of Elway. I would say Elway is better overall. Young may have better skills than Montana but never achieved the same success. Given the fact both had tremendous skill around them that leaves Young behind Monata overall. A solid quarterback but there are too many other great players to rate him a 5.
