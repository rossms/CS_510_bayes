I've only been to Nevada once, so I suppose I have no business rating it! But let me tell you, the week I spent out there in Las Vegas was one of the most fun-filled weeks of my life! As soon as you step off the plane, you know you are in a whole 'nother world. The sights are breathtaking, there is so much to see and do and experience! And I'm not just talking about the casinos. The desert and the mountains are absolutely gorgeous...this coming from an Ohio boy who had never seen such sights before. All in all, I think Nevada is a rockin place and I look forward to the day I can return for my next vacation!
