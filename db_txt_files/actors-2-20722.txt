I thought her show was great...until it turned into a soapbox, rather than a sit-com. Her stand up stuff is usually good too. She also wasn't that bad in If These Walls Could Talk 2. You people are weird...Anne isn't much of an actress either. And what the hell is wrong with pointing out the obvious fact that Bush is the dumb one? Gore's the shifty one. People just vote for the guy they'd be most comfortable having a beer with anyway. Go look at history...it's usually the case. This election was about the Supreme Court, not which idiot would be our new puppet.
