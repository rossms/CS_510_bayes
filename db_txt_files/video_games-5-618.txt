I abolutely adore this game, but I prefer playing this against the computer instead of a human being. There is a version called 'Scabout' that you can download for free from the internet. I think this game takes a lot of skill, strategy and good usage of the English language. Its great when you can build a word up, such as 'film' and also getting words such as'helix'. Its so satisfying when you beat the computer as well.
