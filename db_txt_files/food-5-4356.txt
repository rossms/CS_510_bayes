well you also have to look at ingredients for health reasons.... Just because something is low fat does not mean it is good for you. And compared to most chips FRITOS is only made with corn, salt, and corn oil.. so for the most part it does not have all those yucky additives its not that bad for you, just a bit fattening! but look at the back of pretzles... or another chip they have flour, yeasts, mono tri glycerides etc:
