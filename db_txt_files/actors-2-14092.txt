the rating i give is for acting ability which in most but not all cases(see angelina jolie)has nothing to do with looks. yes denise is a great looking actress BUT she has gotten roles that more desrving actresses should have gotten christmas jones in the world is not enough, wild things and starship troopers(which was a bad film anyways) i think richards like alicia silverstone belong on t.v. in soap opera roles that better suit their acting ability.
