Once upon a time (before the late 80's) there was a beautiful young woman - San Diego. She was an earthy girl self confident and innocent at the same time. She had luxierient long hair, lovely eyes and a golden smile. This young woman had two older sisters San Francisco and LA. Her older sister San Francisco told her to cut her hair. The young woman listened and did as she was told. Her other older sister, LA told her to start wearing sun glasses and stop smiling. The young woman listened and did as she was told. The same girl is still there but now she aint what she used to be.
