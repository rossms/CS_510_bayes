This is another very funny movie, you don't really have to think to much and that's how it should be when your watching a comedy movie. Who wants to think and laugh at the same time? This movie has funny part after funny part, and a lot of the dialogue is very funny. You're trying to score with some goody goody choir girl priss? See, even shitbreak gets it. Man, that Stifler is funny!
