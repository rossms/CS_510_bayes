Pat puts his heart and soul into his job. He also puts accademics ahead of football with Coach John Baxter and his studies program. You know where you stand with Pat. He is the most honest and trustworthy man I know. He still takes time out of his busy schedule for his own sons and their sports. This is a man dedicated not only to Fresno State and making it a team that will go any where any time to play any team but also a man who motivates those around to hold on tight and enjoy the ride. He will definately give his all.
