The Grand Caravan is one of the better minivans out there. In fact, all but a few minivans are worth the buy, which is extremely rare. Although older than the new Quest and Sienna, this van has the highest proven reliablity record, which is a big plus. And it still has enough amentities to make a minivan a buy.
