Oklahoma is a state that you have to get used to just like Kansas. It can be a lot of fun if you know where to go. The Illinios River in Tahlequah (NE part of the state) is a blast to canoe down. In the same area there is the Trail of Tears if you like hisory of the indians. Oklahoma City has several things to do also. There is an amusement park that is a lot of fun. If you go in the spring time, there are the most beautiful electrical storms.
