I really wanted this movie to work, as I am a Dracula/vampire movie freak. But even as I wanted this one to succeed I have to be honest: it stunk! Dracula (Butler) is okay at the beginning in the plane before it goes down, but later he's just lame. And the part about Dracula being Judas was really goofy. Jennifer Esposito is beautiful in anything (she could play one of the Blues Brothers and I'd watch)as ar the other female vampires, but other than that visual delight the movie sucks!
