Has gotten a lot more commercial in the past 5 years... Can walk to most everything...get away from the port, walk down Main Street. Gold Mine is reputable jewelry store, some seem like scams , Beautiful park past Sonesta Suites. Can take a bus right to bus station across from the port($1.40) from hi rise, Always feel safe.
