I love cars and the Camry is one of my favourites suprisingly. Some say the Camry isn't exciting enough, well neither is the Chevy Lumina/Impala or the Ford Taurus! Personally, I'd rather have a good well-made car even if it is a tad boring rather than some lemon hod rod. You call going to back to the dealership for repairs every three or four months exciting?!
