I love my 2000 MPV! Have had it over 1 year and still am very pleased. It has great pick up speed, and every great feature. Family went on very comfortable family vacation drive with the four captain seats and movie screen. Every seat in the van was comfortable for the family, even the back bench! The only minor complaint I have is the placement or spread of the air vents as the front passenger center vent can't turn towards my husband or kids and be off me at the same time: I prefer no cold air on me. Other than that, we all love our van!
