Austin Powers 2: The Spy Who Shagged Me is only for die-hard fans of the original. Without the charming taste of Elizabeth Hurley, the character of Austin Powers is unfunny and extremly annoying. Instead of Hurley, we get Heather Graham who is a beauty, but can't act for the birds. Mike Myers gives his usual performence as the spy, Austin Powers who has to once again save the world from Dr. Evil.
