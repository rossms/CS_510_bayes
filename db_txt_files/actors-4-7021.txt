Christian Slater does have a lot of potential, but he does waste it. he has been in fantastic films such as 'Murder In The First', 'In The Name Of The Rose' and 'Heathers'. But he has done some films that wasted his talent. I agree that it hasn't helped with him trying to be the next Jack Nicholson. He should also quit the booze and drugs and try to build his reputation up to what it should be.
