His last years were very horrible i mean cmon he was like 20 years pro before he quit thats bad for his yardage look at a player like Randy Moss if Randy Moss goes 20 years pro he'll easily pass Jerry Rice. One of these players i list will pass Jerry Rices recieving yards in a season record Randy Moss, Torry Holt, and maybe Chad Johnson. Jerry rice was horrible in my opinion
