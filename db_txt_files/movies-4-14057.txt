A very enjoyable film. I thought it dragged on at times, and found myself sometimes staring at the wall while the movie was playing, but all in all, it was entertaining and very informative. The filmmakers did a good job of showcasing the realties of space and the risks that are involved in going there. Great performances as usual by all the actors in this film.
