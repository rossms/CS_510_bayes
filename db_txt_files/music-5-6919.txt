Coopoy loves The Brew. Post-dating In a Silent Way , it represents one of Mile's earlier experiments with electric instrumentation and a seminal work in jazz rock. It is deep, myterious, but swinging (You know that Coopoy likes his music to swing). The brooding presence of Bennie Maupin's bass clarinet on Spanish Key will send a shivver down your spine.
