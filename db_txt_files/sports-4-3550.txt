A great contact hitter. Often accused of padding his stats at the expense of his team, but he still made the Padres contenders in some seasons were they normally wouldn't of had a chance. Gwynn will always hold a special place in my heart, because he was the one who popped out to Tiger left fielder Larry Hearndon in game 5 of the 1984 World Series, thus clinching the series for my boys. Thanks Tony!!
