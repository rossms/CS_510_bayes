My fiance and I purchased my engagement ring at the Whitehall in Roseville CA Galleria Mall. It was a very wonderful experience. The salesperson was more than helpful and spent 3 hours with us! My ring was sized and ready on time. The only reason we didn't purchase my fiance's ring there is because they just didn't have what we wanted, however they tried to locate one for us. I highly recommend Whitehall Jewelers!
