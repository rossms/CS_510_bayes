I bet I know why this is rated so low on the list - people are sick of being made to read it for school. Folks, please get past the assignment. This bookm is very enjoyable, powerfully written, and at the same time, terrifying. Another rarity that makes young street punks out to be humanity instead of animals that belong in a zoo. Still cannot believe that the author was 16 when she wrote it.
