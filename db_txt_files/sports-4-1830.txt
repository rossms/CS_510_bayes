Here's another team I dislike, but can respect. Division titles from 1991 to 2003. Sure, they only won one World Series during that span, but at least 25 teams in the league would gladly change places with them. I think their streak will end this year, as the Phils and the Fish simply have better squads. Losing Giles for 6 weeks will hurt them, too.
