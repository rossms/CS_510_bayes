George W. Bush is my idol in life. I too am a Compassionate Conservative. My goal is to take that road to the White House and I think that George W. Bush is simply the BEST president this nation has ever had. FDR was a wuss and he had to have Truman back him up when he croaked, and it is a good thing Truman had brains because if not we wouldnt still be the USA. Maybe the USC or USG, United States of China or United States of Germany under Hitler that is.
