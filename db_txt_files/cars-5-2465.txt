Ok the MKIII are not the greatest looking cars and ya they are pretty heavy but i love my 87 and it is never going to be sold......The MKIV model on the otherhand is PERFECT. You can afford one without having to live in it. As for mustangs, corvetts, and camaros i pass a dozan of each on the way home but i have only seen 2 other MKIII's and 1 MKIV around. By the way McLaren boy when you have one in your driveway then you can talk ok?
