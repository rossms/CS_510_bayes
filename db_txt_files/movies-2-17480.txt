In college I lived with a couple of guys from Costa Rica, and Ecuador and they kept going on about how great this was and how I just had to see it etc. Well I'm someone who really enjoys foreign films but I gotta say this one just seemed to strike too far left of bulleye for me. I found it to be a somewhat moronic plot...(two lovers who can't marry because the guy is married to her sister exchange their passion through the meals she prepares for him, blah blah blah). As the John Lovitts character The Critic would say....It Stinks!
