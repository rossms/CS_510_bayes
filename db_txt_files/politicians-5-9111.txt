All the scandals associated with Bill Clinton will be merely a footnote in history compared to the accomplishments this man made for the lower and middle classes of this country. I feel that he is truly a people person and cares about THE PEOPLE. He was the first politican in a long while whom I felt was really trying to accomplish things for people like myself. Am I better off than I was 8 years ago? Absolutely!! I will always regard this man as one of the greatest U.S. presidents. I hope to see Hillary there in 2004!
