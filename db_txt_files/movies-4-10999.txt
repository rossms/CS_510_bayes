This movie was pretty funny and it also had a good story behind it. I enjoyed it but it wasn't something I'd see again or recommend. It was pretty predictable at times for some reason. It reminded me of Mrs. Doubtfire because in both movies the men dressed as old fat women. So, they were trying to use the same tactics from comedy, which made the movie unoriginal in the creative dept.
