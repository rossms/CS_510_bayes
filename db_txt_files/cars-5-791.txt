THE F SERIES OF CANNONDALE IS VERY WELL ENGINEERED AND CONSTRUCTED. THE WEIGHT IS AMAZING WHEN YOU COMPARE IT TO MOST SERIES FROM OTHER MAJOR MANUFACTURERS. THE LOWER END WILL ALLOW ANY ONE TO GET INTO MOUTAIN BIKING AND EXPERIENCE IT LIKE THE PRO . THE UPPER END DOES KINDA GOES OFF INTO THE STATOSPHERE IN REGARD OF PRICE AND I HAVEN'T EVEN SEEN SOMEONE ON THE F500. GUESS I JUST CAN'T SEE THEM SINCE THEY PROBABLY FLY BY! HAVE FUN AND ALWAYS BE SAFE.
