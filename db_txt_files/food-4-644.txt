A good source of protein. Thick, bubbly rice flakes that get soggy fast and taste slightly chemical. But still yummy with Splenda. Not worth the hefty price tag when off sale. I think it's unfortunate the way it's been marketed as part of a weight loss program, because I'm embarrassed to be seen with a box in my cart at the supermarket. Stupid Kellogg's - fruits and veggies are parts of weight loss plans too, but do you see anybody embarrassed to have apples and cucumber in their cart? Nope.
