a friend of mine went to Poland for an art opening. he went to Looz(spelling). anyway while there he was attacked by a queer in a bar, not once, but twice. his polish friend was attacked and slashed w/a beer bottle. the police wouldn't help and people kept stealing his beer and smokes. great country. sounds like America
