This movie, though impeccably written and wonderfully acted convinced me that I never wanted to be on a jury - especially if it involved a capital crime. Egad! The tedium, the back and forth is he guilty is he innocent , badgering, debating arguing on and on into the night! If you enjoy tense, tight dialog in a claustrophobic setting - this flick is for you! Glad I saw it once, but once was more than enough.
