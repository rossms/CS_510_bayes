Queen, Queen, Queen. Aren't you ever going to stop amazing me? I saw the video for Bohemian Rhapsody , and if I never see it again I will remember it vividly 50 years from now. It was so emotional, so well done, so...so...PERFECT!!! Everyone, even if you hate Queen, should see this video. It might make you smile (or if you don't feel normal human emotions, it will rarely make a person laugh), it might make you cry, it might just downright freak you out. But one thing's for sure---you will love it!
