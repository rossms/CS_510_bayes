This is my home. I love it here, or else I would not be here. Florida is so diverse and beautiful, as are the people. They may not always be friendly, but they are definately interesting to say the least. I love the beaches, rivers, cities and almost everything about this state. The only thing that I hate is the humidity and the crime. :(
