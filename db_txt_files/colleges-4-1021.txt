Princeton is an excellent academic institution. It has a rigorous course load and some demanding classes. It's still top notch yet is the epitome of Ivy Leage stuffiness and high brow elitism ( well, Harvard is like that too, but Princeton is more pretentious about it). Princeton will tell you the Ivies are HYP - Harvard, Yale, Princeton, hoping to link themselves to their more distinguished mates. Basketball has helped elevate the profile of the school.
