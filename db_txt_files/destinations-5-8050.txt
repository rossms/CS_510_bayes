We enjoyed this Museum of fine arts very much, the Hawaiian Art was spectacular! Also we were suprised they had so many famous paintings by the masters like Van Gogh, Picasso, Monet, Gauguin, Matesse, Pissaro, Cezanne and more! Oh and a tip, if you are visiting early in the month the first Wednesday of the month is free! Definetly a bonus :)
