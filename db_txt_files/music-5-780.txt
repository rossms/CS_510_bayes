I really enjoyed her 1st album, but had wished there were more fast-paced songs. In the sophmore album, she delivered. The songs sound playful and rollicking without ever losing Fiona's moody undertones. I enjoyed the new wide range of instruments backing up and supporting her voice in its incredible and expressive range.
