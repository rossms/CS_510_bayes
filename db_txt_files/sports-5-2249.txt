I gave them 5 stars because they are my team and I love them to death, but the Mets ownership is the worst in baseball..Please Wilpons if you guys are reading this..Sell the team to some owners that would take a chance..I am a die hard Mets fan, but I envy a owner like George Steinbrenner...Go Mets!
