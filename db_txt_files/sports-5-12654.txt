Between Texas's 2 awesome WR's Roy Williams and BJ Johnson, phenominal RB Cedric Benson, and one of the best Qb's in the game, Chris Simms, Teas is the perfect recipe for a National Championship!!! We may have a few set backs (ie. Oklahoma), but it is still a good possibility. I'm cheering for them full force. Hook Em' Horns!!!
