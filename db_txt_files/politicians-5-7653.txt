With the Louisiana Purchase, he doubled the size of the United States. Jefferson believed in small government and believed that people should govern themselves. He also banned the slave trade as president and had the vision to fund the Lewis and Clark Expedition. Jefferson also knew how to handle the judiciary. Right before Adams left office, Adams packed the courts with partisan federalist judges. When Jefferson assumed the presidency, he didn't try to remove the judges or have them impeached, Jefferson simply wouldn't pay them thereby eliminating half of Adams horrible appointees. Brilliant!
