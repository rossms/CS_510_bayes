For some reason Buick always gets a bad rap from people, and I will never understand why. The LeSabre is another example that Buick is a solid car company. Its a reliable car with good resale values, but reliability is only at average. The back seat could be bigger for the size of the car. If you have enough money, go all out and get the Park Avenue, its much better.
