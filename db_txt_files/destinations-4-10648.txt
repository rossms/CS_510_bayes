I believe that Drum is a good cigarette but not good enough to be considered a 5 because after about 3/4ths of the bag, the taste can get rather irritating. The taste is sweeter than most cigs. Also, the fact that you get to roll them yourself is satisfying. But, when in a rush, this may hinder your need for a fix.
