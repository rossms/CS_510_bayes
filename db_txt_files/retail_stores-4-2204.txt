I like shopping at Publix....usually although I live in Eagle Harbor, Orange Park, Florida, I drive to the Mandarin Road Publx....the service is exceptional and they ALWAYS have everything I need.... Eagle Harbor is a good store....but two things that are not good.....too many kids running around and screaming.....very distracting and they have such a high customer base, it is hard to find many things available... Publix is a good clean store with friendly employees.
