A great amusement park. We have been there many times and they have some terrific rides. If you like roller coasters, Cedar Point has some of the best. I like the Raptor.they also have rides for the smaller kids to enjoy.they have a dolphin show that is fun to watch and some other attractions. Also at least the last time we went there they have a picnic area so if you do not want to buy the parks food you can bring your own picnic.
