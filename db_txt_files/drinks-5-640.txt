This stuff is cheap over here in Taiwan. This beer is extremely popular in Hong Kong. This is the beer of surprises! You may get a regular can with 5%abv BUT you may get that special can with a 8%abv! Thanks to the brewers who don't control the alcohol content very much. The beer has a nice, clean, crisp taste but drink very cold only-it can get ugly as it warms. Oh and watch out for the San Miguel shits drink too many and you will experience San Miguels biggest surprise...
