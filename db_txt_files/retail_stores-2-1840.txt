Walmart sucks b/c first, you can't even find a parking spot. If you do, it's one on the other side of the world so you have to walk for ever just to get in. Second, the place is too crowded. It's like everybody goes there. Third, you can't find anything b/c people have thrown everything on the floor and messed it up and nobody comes to fix it. Fouth, you gotta go look for an employee to help you. Fifth, the line to pay is always at least 20 minutes long. Sixth, when you're on your way out, lucky you if you can find your car w/o a car running you over
