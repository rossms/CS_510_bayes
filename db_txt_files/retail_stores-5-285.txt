I recently tried Victoria's Secret Light Control Pantyhose and fell in love with them. Since I put them on about 3 months ago, I have worn them every day. They feel so silky. The waistband is not too tight and the panty is soft. I have never loved a product as much as these pantyhose. I love and worship Victoria's Secret Light Control Pantyhose.
