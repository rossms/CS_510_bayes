They should finish second and compete for a wild-card spot. If Mark Pryor and Kerry Wood stay healthy, the sky's the limit for them. They've got a good infield with Garciaparra and Aramis Ramirez. Sure they lost quality outfielders like Sosa and Alou, but Corey Patterson, Jeromy Burnitz and Todd Hollandsworth should fill in the void nicely.
