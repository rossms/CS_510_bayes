One attends Berkeley to make a difference in the world NOT to simply to gather the title to acquire a job that will allow you to buy that digital tv or SUV upon graduation. Berkeley may be perceived as a hippy or weinnie (brillant choice of words!) or lower than average university. Nevertheless, that is the opinion nationally NOT internationally, where Cal is viewed as one of the most intellectual institutions in all fields of study.
