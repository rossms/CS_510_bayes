I am on my second FXR an 87 CHP bike and there is not another ride out there that I would give it up for period. The FXR does everything and does it well I have put a lot of long trip miles on it as well as using it for all of my daily driving, and it is all the bike I ever need. I have owned it for several years and it just gets better, I have upgraded with newer HD forks,brakes, engine mod.s etc. but even before anything was done it still was a great ride for anything I asked of it.
