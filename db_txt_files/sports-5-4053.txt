Though I can't pronounce his name, he is one of the greatest coaches of all time. The early entry of Duke players into the NBA has hurt Coach K of late. But year in and year out, he fields a classy team and carries himself with great poise and dignity. I guess the true testament would be if my son were going to be a college hoopster (that ain't gonna happen unless the NCAA changes the rules and awards 4 points for airballs), I would want Coach K to mentor him.
