I liked this alot. The ending was very unexpected, but I guess if you looked a little deeper you could have worked it out (DOH). Usually can't stand Bruce Willis and avoid anything he is in, however the plot got me interested. His acting ability left me contented, but young Haley Joel Osment needs to take all credit.
