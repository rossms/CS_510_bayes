I thought this movie was really good. It had a really good story to it and it made alot of sence with the whole faith thing. i thought the movie dragged on alot though. that is the only reason i didnt rate it a 5. But if u like movies with a moral to it, and are willing to sit 128 minutes then this is a good movie to see. If your the kind of person that likes action movies with a big climax then dont watch this movie!
