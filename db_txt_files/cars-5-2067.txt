Sex on wheels. The 355 Spider is a 4.9 sec 0-60 car so those saying it is too slow are maybe asking a bit much. My modified turbo z runs about this quick, but I'd take the spider anyday (sorry z, I still love you). As for nitrous and a blower making a true sports car??? Sounds like someone's been sniffing the high octane. A good description of a dragster perhaps, and we all know how well they handle!
