Beltran didn't want to play for the Astros. We would haved payed him as much as the Mets if you include the income tax NY has. If the Mets weren't fools with monry they would have cut Beltran's contract money by a third, because only the Astros were willing to pay that high. P.S. Berkman is better, he hit in the .300 while Beltran hit .268, come on??
