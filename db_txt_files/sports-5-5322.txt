I absoultely love Kirk Hinrich. He is such an awesome basketball player and knows just about everything about the game. I loved to watch him while he was at KU and now with the CHI BULLS. HE IS ALSO REALLY REALLY REALLY REALLY REALLY HOT!!!!!!! When he came back for his senior year at KU that really shows alot as far as respect goes. He turned his back on millions of dollars. And I can't wait to see what he has to show in the NBA- Did I mention that he was hot?
