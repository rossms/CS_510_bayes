Once again, proof that inteligence and insanity are a dangerous combination. In the tradition of '12 Angry Men', the film shows that you can have a tense and suspenseful plot with a small set. But I felt it fell apart at the end. The killer getting away had me thinking that they were going to do 'Phone Booth 2'. They could have done a better job with the end.
