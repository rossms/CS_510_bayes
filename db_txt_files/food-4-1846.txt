This is my favorite gumball machine type of candy. When I used to go to a bowling alley in high school, I considered it lucky to have my mouth full of Runts when I was bowling. They should probably warn consumers against that in the packaging (or on the gumball machine as it may be). In any case, these are good but I'd never by them in a store. And the banana ones are pretty gross.
