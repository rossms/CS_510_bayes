Im rating this as a midsize sedan, becuase thats what it is. For an Infiniti, yes it is pretty cheap. But, its more of a redesigned Honda Civic, with just 2 more inches of padding, and other very low cost luxury features. $22,000 is too much for a tiny midize sedan, when competitors like the Accord and Camry are available.
