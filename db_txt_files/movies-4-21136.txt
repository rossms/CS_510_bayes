Along with Diner, this is Kevin Bacon's best early role. He absolutely carries this film. The plot is simple. Bacon's character moves to a small town in the midwest from the big city and struggles to fit in in a town which doesn't allow dancing or music. Sure, it seemed completely unrealistic and there aren't too many movies from the 80s which will seem more dated (after all, you'll see Sarah Jessica Parker as a high school student as opposed to a horny New Yorker). Yet, if you've never seen it, check it out. It will be a pretty quick hour and a half.
