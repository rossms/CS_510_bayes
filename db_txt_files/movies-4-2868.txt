Very entertaining film. You can almost always count on Clancy for a good, complicated premise and Sum of All Fears is no exception. Affleck was a very convincing Jack Ryan--a role which has been botched in the past. The combination of very sound acting, a quality story-line and some ridiculous special effects (when the bomb goes off) makes this film well worth dishing out the $8.50 to see in the theater.
