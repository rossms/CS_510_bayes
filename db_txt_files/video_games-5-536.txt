The best. We just got the deluxe version for Christmas oooooooh aaaaaah! My only problem is that I was always the shoe, now my husband tells me that he wants to be the shoe and that the mom of the family is always the thimble (I have found this to be true..odd) I don't want to be the stupid thimble.
