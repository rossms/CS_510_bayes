A sweet looking ride that has good pickup, lots of cargo space and it was reasonably priced. Those are the good points. The bad outweigh the good. I had my 99 Blazer for 13 months and I had to put more than 2 grand into it. Buddy of mine is a mechanic and he says that the Blazers are notorious for being high maintenance money suckers. I couldn't agree more.
