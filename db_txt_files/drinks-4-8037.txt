What a bunch of morons! Southern Comfort is not, and does not pretend to be, a whiskey at all! It is a liqueur! Southern Comfort is for bourbon what Drambuie is for Scotch. It is intended to be sweet,its an aperatif! FOR A LIQUEUR, it's not bad. But watch out, it's also a rotten red wine and a rotten rum and a rotten lots of other things it's not meant to be.
