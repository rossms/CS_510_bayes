Sorry, folks. I, as an Alien purist, feel I have to drag this sucker down to its rightfuls rank -- SOMEWHERE Below ALIEN. Yes, it's great fun, and has lots of good action, suspense, and some drama, too. But these gung-ho military types are sometimes annoying. And James Horner's score here is one of the very worst mish-mash, bombastic rip-off scores Ever. I like this movie a lot, too, but admit it, this is a less brainy bulletfest compared to its predecessor.
