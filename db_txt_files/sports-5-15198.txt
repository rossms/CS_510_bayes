Why is no one writing comments this guy is a fast runner can catch well he can breack tackles like marshall faulke just because hardly anyone who doesn'tlive in seattle doesn't like the hawks it's no reason to say the whole team sucks I mean Shaun Alexander got over 1'500 yards rushing this year he got two touchdowns not to mention a 30 yard run this guy is probably one of the best running backs of all time
