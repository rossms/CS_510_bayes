This game is Friggin scary!! the graphics are fantastic , it makes the game looks real . its pretty long , yet some parts are a bit disturbing . The enemies look a little hilarious , the pair of legs attatched to another pair of legs , hahahahaha! This game is loaded with enemies having seizures , and there is a part of the game that everyone will remember , the hospital , you know how hospitals are at night . Anyway , if u want to stay up and have night terrors for the rest of your life , play this game or i will be pissed , just kidding , play it please !
