No need to get into the plot, I'm sure it's familiar to most people by now. My only tiny complaint is that the narrator has a somewhat annoying style of patronizing and condescending to kids. Tolkien himself admitted this in the collection of letters compiled by his biographer Humphrey Carpenter. Hopefully, a good film will be made of this book, though it may take a while as the rights to it are tangled up between two companies. A masterful children's classic that teaches valuable lessons without being pedantic.
