The greatest mechanical hitter ever. His fundamentals were flawless. He hit .406 in 1941 (the last player to ever hit over .400), but didn't win the MVP because that was the year of DiMaggio's 56 game hitting streak. Williams's lifetime on base percentage was an alarming .483! He obviously has nothing to do with the debate going on about what to do with his corpse.
