I'm afraid the above commenters just don't understand doughnuts. Krispy Kreme may be a little greasy, and its selection doesn't approach that of its monopolistic rival. But there is nothing more satisfying than biting into a hot, messy, freshly made Krispy Kreme. The raspberry-filled variety easily outshines any of those nasty jelly things at Dunkin Donuts. A person hasn't experienced New York until they have made at least one stop (and you can't stop after just one) at a KK.
