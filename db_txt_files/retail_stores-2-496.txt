I used to love this store 3-4 years ago, but lately, I can't stand to shop there anymore b/c their low-rise jeans fit me terribly (not to mention they are corny-looking) and all of their cotton dress pants stretch out to eternity after a couple of hours of wear! If you like being a smaller size than what you normally are (I'm a 5/6 in mostly every store, but only a 4 in NY&CO) then this is the store for you.
