It took 8 phone calls, 3 letters and 3 months to get a ATM card through our branch. The reason for this was the toll-free telephone Customer Service Center didn't have updated account-holder information which had been given to the branch where the (established) account is located. Branch Manager was not sure exactly who to contact at CCB to enable Customer Service to access the correct information. Branch Manager not returning emails on this issue. Very low level of professionalism in dealing with customers.
