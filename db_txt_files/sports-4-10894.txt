Al Groh is quietly, or maybe not so quietly, putting together one of the best young teams in college football. They spanked the Terps and Mountaineers, and have a boatload of talent coming in next year. At first, I thought leaving the Jets for UVA was silly, but now it looks like he's definitely executing on his plan and that is very respectable. Look for UVA to be very competitive with the Noles and Wolfpack next year for the ACC.
