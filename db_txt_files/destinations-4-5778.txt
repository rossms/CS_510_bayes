FYI: The high temperature in New York for 4 of the last 5 summers has beaten the ALL-TIME HIGH for the city of Miami (98 degrees F). And people complain about Florida being hot? On a negative note, it is hard to rate a state higher than a 4 when it still does not know who it voted for in the last presidential elections before this one...
