I just don't get most of R.E.M.'s music. I recently bought two of theit tapes, Auto being one of them, and I just don't like the music. Everybody Hurts is OK and the other one has Losing My Religion, which I love. Being from Georgia, I wish I could be a fan but it doesn't seem to be in the cards for me.
