Yep, I agree. I am an IT Manager and have worked with OS's right from DOS and Win2000 is the best so far, better than XP because it doesn't try to be too clever yet clever enough to keep your Apps going without any problems and still well supported. No doubt MS will stop support for this in a couple of years and force people to move onto annoying OS's like XP !
