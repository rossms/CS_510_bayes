I have never been impressed with Blockbuster. Rental fees are too high, selection is mediocre and rental periods are far too short. Plus, by having the cutoff time for return set at 12 noon, this guarantees that many people won't get an item returned by then (before work) and Blockbuster gets to charge late fees.
