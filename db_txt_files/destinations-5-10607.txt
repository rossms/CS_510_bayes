Totem Smokes! These are, without a doubt, the best cigarettes around. They are worth the extra money. There is no chemically after-taste and they burn forever. The regulars can get heavy after a couple packs, but the lights and perique blends are just as good. The hand-rolling tobacco that they sell is also very good.
