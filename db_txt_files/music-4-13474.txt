I think that their latest album has more bad language on it than the one before it, (that don't bother me though) and before I got the Eternal 1999 one off my brother I was expecting it to be the same sort of style. I was surprised to find how different the two albums are, the BTNHResurrection album overall is Phat(with a capital P)
