Roald Dahl is one of the most imaginative authors for children's books ever. Matilda is a book that will definitely appeal to children. There is constant portrayal of wicked adults and a little girl who is smarter than any of them. To top it off, she has magical powers so she can control them. This might sound negative, but it's all in fun and there is one good adult present in the story.
