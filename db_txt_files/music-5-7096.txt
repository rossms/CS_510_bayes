The greatest 1980s music video, A-Ha's 'Take On Me' was also the most innovative of this wonderful decade. Who would have thought of mixing comic-sketch drawings with a storyline that takes place in a cafe? The music video spurred hope for many hopeless romantics in that dreams can come true if you truly believe. It is too bad, however, that 'Take On Me' served as A-Ha's one great song/music video, rendering this group merely as a one-hit wonder. But what a memorable hit it was.
