I've flown many times on just about all the different US airlines, but recently I flew for the first time in Jet Blue, this is by far the best around. If you sit in the back of the plane you get a few extra inches of leg room, it doesn't sound like much until you sit in the seat, it really is a lot. Having the TV is great, it really helped the time fly by. I read some of the comment about the flight attendants I found them to be friendly and very helpful. From now on Jet Blue is the first airline I will look for.
