I actually like this album. I wouldn't go as far to say it is their best album ever but, definitely not bad at all. I have been a fan of this band for well over a decade and can't really say that I dislike any of there albums. I don't care what anyone says about this band, they have been around for 20 years now and have earned the respect they deserve. Anyway, for those who say they are sell outs...YOU'D DO THE SAME THING!!!!!!!!!!! P.S.- Check out their newest album American Idiot...SOOOOOOOOO good!!! :)
