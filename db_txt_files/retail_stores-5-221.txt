Love it! I have Banana Republic clothes that have lasted me since I was in high school. The clothes are so classic you can wear them for years and no one will notice they aren't new. That to me makes the high price worth it. I don't understand the people complaining about the clothes being teenybopper, they aren't at all, they have a totally differant target market.
