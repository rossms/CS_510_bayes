They've made a comeback. In the early 90's they were a good chain, then they declined. Something happened, probably the droves of people failing to return, that made them turn around. No they're not the best, or even close, but they have good (americanized) italian fare at reasonable prices. It would be nice to have authentic, home cooked italian meals all the time, but when you can't, Olive Garden isn't bad.
