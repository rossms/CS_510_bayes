Quite possibly the best ever of the Final Fantasy series. This game got me better than when I played FF8, and I LOVED FF8. I love everything about this game: graphics, gameplay, leveling, story, fighting, the damage/hp/mp cap breaks. Revolutionary game in the FF series, leading the way for future FF series games for PS2. (Writing this not having played X-2 yet...)
