I think Nissans partership with Renault has paid divedends, particularly with the Infiniti brand. This car defined the term 4 Door Sports Car in the late 80's early 90's. And it's still a barnburner, though I think the number of viable alternatives is certainly a detriment to its cause. Styling has taken a turn for the quirky. Also it's interior fit and finish is lagging behind others in this segment.
