Much better than its sequel. Good costumes and settings for the time, a simple, but rather good plot, and I love the opening speech by Mako, who is probably best known for providing the voice of the demonic villain on the contemporary cartoon Samurai Jack. Good stuff, and a decent performance by James Earl Jones as the bad guy in this.
