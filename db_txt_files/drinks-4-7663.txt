Best of the small batch stuff. This is about the only type of liquor my sister will drink so I always pick some up when she's going to be in town. To my taste it has very little of what may be called "traditional" bourbon flavor. As a previous reviewer said, it has strong overtones of honey, as well as vanilla and finishes mildly but warmly. A little cloying straight, but because of the sweetness it makes the best mint julep on the face of the earth.
