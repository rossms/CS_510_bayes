He was one of if not the greatest baseball player of all time. He hit many long balls he hit the longest homer ever at fenway park. His numbers were amazing his attributes were not as good as his character. He had a golden heart and an everlasting love for our country. He spent many years in our armed forces, so thats the main reason why he probably isnt considered baseballs greatest player. But i knoiw for a fact if he wasnt in our armed forces there is no doubt in any ones eyes that he was and still is BASEBALLS GREATEST PLAYER
