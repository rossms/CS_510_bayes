This is my second kind of series by R.L. Stine. The title saids it all, you sure get goosebumps after reading one of those stories. It is really interesting to find out what goes in R.L. Stines curiosity mind to see if he can frighten us like Steven King can. I believe he is the Steven King for Children.
