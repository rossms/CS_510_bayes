The perfect choice...if you're a Democrat looking for your party to hold onto the White House. My idealogical differences with him aside, I don't see how the Republican party thinks that Cheney is going to help Bush win the presidency. People keep talking about how this proves that Bush is looking to adults who are seasoned and more experienced. Maybe I'm crazy, but I'd like for the president to be an adult and surrounded by complementary players. Next thing you know, he is going to bring back Al Haig to be his Secretary of State.
