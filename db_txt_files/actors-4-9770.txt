I have seen a few of her movies and Reese did a good acting job in the ones I saw. I liked her in Election where she played the overachiever student Tracey Flick and I liked her in Legally Blonde. I have not seen a lot of her movies since some of them were teenage movies. I think she has a lot of potential though..
