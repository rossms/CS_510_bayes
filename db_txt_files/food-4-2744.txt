This would get 5 stars if it wasn't for cadbury's Bounty bar. The same concept except with better chocolate and coconut. Anyway in both cases the pairing is heavenly. Of course coconut - as some other foods such as cilantro - is a distinctive taste; you love it or hate it. Dont reach for this candy if you hate it, it has a STRONG coconut taste not some subtle flavor accent
