OOOH! I know a line from one of my favorite songs that would perfectly describe his presidency: It started off so well. (The song, by the way, is Save Me by Queen, and the title perfectly describes the situation of the USA under his son.) What the f*** was he thinking, puking on a Japanese statesman?! And he said it was a good thing we had under God in the pledge of allegiance. What a jerk! I am glad he was voted out of office and replaced by Clinto, who, despite what crazy CONservatives think, is a good, kind man. And now, his idiot son with the spoiled brat daughters is in office! So save me !!!!
