Excellent selection of fitness gear for swimming and other athletic pursuits. A little pricey but, their target audience tends to be better educated and well heeled. They sell a little radio to use while swimming. An outstanding concept but, this product (Waverunner Radio) barley rates 2 stars in my book. Unreliable with terrible reception! I ve been through at least four of these buggers in a two year span! Sound quality is good. But, reliability, durability and quality have trouble staying afloat!
