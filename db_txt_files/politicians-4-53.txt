Reading some of the other reviews I am baffled at the complete short sightedness of most of them. The Queen, the royal family probably bring 10 times more money then they cost. Tourisim people tourisim. Any one can have Palaces and Castles but with out royality they are just old big buildings. Also it keeps the country closer to its history while retaining the worlds perception of Britain.
