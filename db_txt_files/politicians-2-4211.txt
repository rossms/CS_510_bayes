Nader would be my second choice, but what is more concerning is the fact, anyone actually believes that Bush is a good candiate. His name is all he has. He wants to partially privatize Social Scurity, his tax cut is for the rich, and I can go on. Gore isn't the slickest Politican I have ever seen, but I find that refreshing. Do you know that the state legislature in Texas meets only every other year? Bush isn't going to get anything done, because he doesn't understand the game. Please do the wise thing and vote for Gore.
