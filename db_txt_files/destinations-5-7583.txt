Zoo Atlanta has made a lot of extensive changes in the past year! It is well worth the money if you remind yourself that it is a non-profit organization, and they are part of great conservation and education efforts across the world! Well worth the visit ... ride the train, climb the rock wall, visit the petting zoo section, see the pandas, and enjoy the beautiful foliage!
