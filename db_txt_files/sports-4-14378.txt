Even though I bleed red-white-and-blue Bills colors, and as much as I have despised and hated the Dolphins all these years, even I know when to give recognition to one of the most talented football quarterbacks ever to lace up a pair of cleats. He was a crybaby at times, and I loved it whenever he got drilled to the turf by Bruce Smith. But boy, was he a competitor. Those Bills-Dolphins games of the 1980s and 1990s were some of the fiercest, mpost bitterly-fought games I've ever witnessed. Way to go, Danny boy, for entertaining us all these years.
