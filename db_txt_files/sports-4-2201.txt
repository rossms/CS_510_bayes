Y'all should update your votes and posts, because this is a very sound team that's going to cause considerable trouble for other squads in the NL in 2003. They have a strong offense, a solid starting rotation, a will to win and a supportive fan base. The only minus is that they play in the most competitive division in baseball, which may make the playoffs a very distant goal.
