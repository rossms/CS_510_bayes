Ok, I get it, Jennifer Garner is a veritable paragon. Apparently, her fans require a 24 hr Jenny TV channel to keep them updated on all her escapades.UPDATE: Look, I barely know who this woman is, but she apparently has an adoring group of acolytes who think she is God's gift to humankind. What are you guys doing with these constant paeans to her-get her nomimated for the Nobel Peace Prize?
