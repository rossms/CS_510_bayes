An interesting storyline and solid performances make this movie worth watching. A taxi driver (Jaime Foxx) was having a pretty good day until he met Vincent (Tom Cruise), who pays him to take him around the town for the night for business. Which is fine, until he finds out what kind of business it is. I appreciated that the characters weren't two-dimensional; Cruise, the antagonist, is still rather likable. I liked the interaction between Cruise's character and Foxx's. One of the better movies I've seen lately.
