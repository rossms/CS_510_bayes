Quizno's makes very good hot subs. I love their smoked turkey. However, they need to make COLD-CUT sandwiches as well. I've lived in various parts of the U.S., and I don't understand how here in the Midwest there are a dearth of good sub shops that serve cold sandwiches where they freshly slice the cold-cuts in front of you! I truly miss those tasty and aromatic oil and vinegar spritzed cold-cut meat subs they serve in states like New York and New Jersey! I am drooling on my keyboard as I type the last sentence...
