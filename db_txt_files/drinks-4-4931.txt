Not as good as Coke but better than Pepsi. Diet R.C. is particularly interesting because it uses the Splenda artificial sweetner rather than aspartame. The flavor is closer to sugar and I don't worry so much about what it may be doing to my liver. I agree with the person that said that R.C. could overtake Pepsi with stronger advertising (but please, not another trashy little chippie like Miz Britney to plug the stuff!).
