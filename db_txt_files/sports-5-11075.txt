Does anyone know that this team is top 10? Does anyone know anybody on this team except for Kay Jay Harris, who recently broke the conference single game rushing record? That answer is usually no. If you can take a bunch of mediocre kids and turn them into winners, like the 1980 US Olympic Hockey team, then you know you have the makings of a great coach.
