Again, a horribly-overrated comedy teen movie strikes. Although this manages to be better than twin terrors that are Bring it On and Sugar Spice, it still stinks. There's way too much profanity, disrespectful attitude in a bad way, illegal acts and hate of school from the protagonists. Can we call Don Knotts, Dick Van Dyke and Kelsey Grammer to give these peeps comedy lessons?
