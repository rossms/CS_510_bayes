a few catchy songs but all the others are horrible. all of the songs are about her and men(or in her case boys because she's so young). the only thing men like about her is that she has giant, fake boobs. the only thing women like anout her is that she sings about guys liking her so all of the ugly girls use it to raise their self-confidance but they end up just being snoty and shocked why guys tell them that they're ugly.
