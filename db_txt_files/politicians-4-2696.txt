Bill Bradley seems to be a man of integrity and honesty. His record in the Congress is pretty exemplary with his education and Health Care initiatives, not to mention his economic proposals. A true-blue liberal. However, I really think that he should stay in the Senate because I do not think that he is electable as he is very much TOO liberal for me.
