One of the best players I've ever seen in the NBA. He's always a guy on the team to count on. He's scored in the 40's about 50 times in his career. He makes amazing slam dunks, has made over like a thousand in his career. The only thing that would make him the best player of all time would be if he worked on his free throws and 3 pointers.
