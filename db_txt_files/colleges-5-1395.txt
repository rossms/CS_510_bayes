Newberry College is a wonderful place to be. I graduated in 2005 and have been back many times. I met my best friends there and learned many life skills, as well as social. You are going to find something to complain about at every college there is you just have to be mature enough to do something about it instead of just complaining. The administration and faculty at Newberry College have one goal, furthering and bettering the College in any way they can. Going there was one of the three best decisions I ever made in my life. Hail the Scarlet and the Gray!
