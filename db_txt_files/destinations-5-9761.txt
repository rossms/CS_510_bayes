I love the taste of Turkish Golds. They were my first cigarette. Only problem is whenever I smoke a Camel now it gives me a pain in my lungs so I did something I never though I'd do and I switched to Marlboro 72's. I know it wasn't a good choice and it was hard too, but what's a smoker to do when his favorite smoke hurts his lungs to the point he has to change brands. The fact that I'm smoking Marlboro's makes me want to quit.
