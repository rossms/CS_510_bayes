There are many things wrong with this beer. First, it isn't a bock but a version of a barleywine. Second, it isn't a particularly good example of the style. Third, it is made with maple syrup and matured in whiskey barrels. All of this creates a very complex yet undrinkable brew that is more akin to wine than beer. While complexity and vineous character is often the goal of a barleywine Samuel Adams seems to have placed their energy in creating more of a showpiece resulting in a really pretentious brew rather than a truly great beer. Final point, save your money and sample a variety of true barleywines.
