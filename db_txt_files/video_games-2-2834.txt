Although mildly entertaining, this game stinks. The gameplay went so fast, I could not even follow where Sonic was going and I always died. The plot was dumb, and the voices were demonic. Plus the added feature of playing as different characters was redundant, the game was the exact same. Sonic was a stinker!
