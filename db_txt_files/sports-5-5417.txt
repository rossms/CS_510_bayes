I love him... I'm sooo glad he got picked today. You know... you guys said Collison could take Anthony... well uhm why didn't he? He had the chance! I would have to say that Carmelo is an excellent player and will be a great player for the Nuggets. The Nuggets could use him... He's a great 3 man and he has talent which is hard to come by. I love Carmelo Anthony!! HE IS THE BEST!! Plus, he's good enough to be a little cocky about it. He knows he's good... get over it people.
