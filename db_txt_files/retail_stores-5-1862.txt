I LOVE WALMART! Just give me what I want, when I want it (24-hr stores) for a reasonable price (always lowest) and I'm satisfied. It ain't rocket science folks. My only gripe is that the lines are too long. But that just prooves my point. People know where to go to get what they need. My favorite thing is in the summer time when they sell BBQ and hotdogs outside. Weeeee! Discount Party.
