I had this album (yep, actual VINYL) for over two years before I ever turned it to side two. Friedman and Mustaine play good cop, bad cop with the lead work, incredible rhythm section (some of Dave Ellefson's finest work)and strong songwriting make this one a KEEPER. Holy Wars/The Punishment Due down through Five Magics is one of the greatest sets of songs EVER on a metal record. BUY IT!!!
