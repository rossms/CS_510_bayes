Without a doubt, this game forever changed the video game industry. It had (at the time) excellent graphics, realistic sounds, and a frightening sense of reality - it was one of those games where one could practically lose themselves in the game, effectively shutting themselves off from the real world. It is also one of, if not the most, customizable games in history. Custom maps can still be found all over the internet, this game has truly stood the test of time even though it's over a decade old.
