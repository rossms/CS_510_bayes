i love smoking these outside, after a while you can really get a hint of a sweet taste, perfect for any where, and goes down nicely with alcohol. if you can order a carton of these and reds online and make sure they are swedish-made. you wont regret it! p.s, i was amazed to find out how many people were smoking these, i didnt think they were common.
