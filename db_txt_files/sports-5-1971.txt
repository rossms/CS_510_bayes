HEY THE YANKEES ARE THE BEST! The Braves and Red Sox are over rated cuz they face the sissy teams. Nobody has a squad that has a whole team hitting the long ball. And the pitchers have championship experience. The Braves have a title for the decade of dominance: who gives a crap if you win 10 straight division titles? World Series during this decade of dominace: 1. The Yankees won 4 World Series, including 2 from the Braves. Pick the Yankees as the best team in baseball.
