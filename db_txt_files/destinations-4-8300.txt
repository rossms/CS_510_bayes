It's adjacent to Olvera Street (also on this list), and near Chinatown and Little Tokyo, so it can easily be part of a downtown tour. Although it's just a train station, it's a beautiful Mission/art deco building (with recently refurbished grounds), and many movies have been filmed both inside and outside it (including Blade Runner, Charlie's Angels, The Way We Were, etc.) for you film buffs.
