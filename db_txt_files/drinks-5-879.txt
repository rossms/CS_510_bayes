A delight when it's fresh. A very smooth, dry beer with a unique taste to it. Flavorful enough to enjoy on it's own, yet light enough to drink as part of your meal. Someone mentioned a skunky quality about Heinekin, and I can taste what they mean; however the brewers somehow contain that slightly bitter flavor and make it part of the overall experience. I've heard Heineken's skunky properties compared to Grolsch, but for my money Grolsch is not half the product Heineken is.
