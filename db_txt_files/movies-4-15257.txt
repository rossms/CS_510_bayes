A 4.5. Very good movie about the Holocaust horrors seen through the eyes of one man. He is a painist who played the piano on a radio show in Poland when his life and family went through the holocaust. Very well done movie well acted by Adrien Brody.we also watched the documentary on the dvd we rented from Roman Polanski how sad to learn that Roman Polanski went through his ownhorrors of the holocaust when he was a child.
