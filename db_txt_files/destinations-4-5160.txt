Colorado has beautiful scenery and plenty of winter sports to take part in. Denver is an intresting city with much to do (take in a Rockies game, go shopping in downtown, etc...). Not to mention that there are many beautiful women roaming about. Where this state falls short is cost of living versus surrounding areas.
