The guy had to have been on the juice. He was great as a Red Sox member, but he got too strong and his body's joints and ligaments and tendons couldn't handle it. Too bad, cuz he was a really great hitter before any of that nonsense. Let's call a spade a spade though. He landed Mia Hamm. And she's about as hot and sexy as it gets, so good for him. She's the bom. Hope her second marriage goes better than her first.
