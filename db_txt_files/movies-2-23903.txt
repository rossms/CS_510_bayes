The battle scenes were generally impressive, it looks accurate and impressive, and Sean Bean as Odysseus, Peter O'Toole as Priam, and Eric Bana as Hector were credible enough, saving it, barely, from being a 1 star movie, though it should be a 1.5. The rest of this movie was predictable in that I kind of knew that one of the greatest stories in the history of the human race was going to be Wolfgang Petersoned and Brad Pitted. It didn't have to be completely faithful to Homer, but neither did it have to be so ridiculously torn to shreds either.
