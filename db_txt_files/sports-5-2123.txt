I really started to follow the Twins when they were in the playoffs last year. This team is awesome! I love A.J. Pierzynski (even if some say he plays dirty ), Doug Mientkiewicz (great smile), Torii Hunter (can that guy run, or what?) Dustan Mohr (good arm) and Jacque Jones (with a genuine love for baseball). I'm going to a spring training game this month -- go Twins!
