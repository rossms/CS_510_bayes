The walk into the entrance to this cave is so awe inspiring that it will cause one to believe in the existence of an almighty and loving God if you don't do so already. The cave is simply magnificent, spectacular and incredibly beautiful. It is well worth the trip. Also, during the spring, summer, and fall do not forget to attend the bat flight program in the early evening hours. There you will see a million or so bats emanating from the huge entrance.
