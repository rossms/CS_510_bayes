The barbecue pizza at CiCi's is my absolute favorite pizza. I rank it above any pizza that I have had at any other pizza chain. There are also several other pizza's that are available at CiCi's that are not available at other chains. Since it is a buffet you can try various pizza's at a price of $3.99 per person, which also includes a salad bar. This is a nice feature when taking large groups out to eat. The customer service is also better at CiCi's than at any other chain I have been to. Thanks CiCi's, you have my business. Kevin Plott
