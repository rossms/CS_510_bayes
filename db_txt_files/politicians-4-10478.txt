A good, God fearing man whom I'm proud to call my leader! I disagree with a lot of what he proposes, but I RESPECT him for standing his ground. He knows he is not perfect, unlike his predecessor, and he relies on the Lord for strength and guidance, something we all could do more of. GW, keep the faith!
