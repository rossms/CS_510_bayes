Watch out for pickpockets and bring sunblock, but Thailand is a great place to visit. Wonderful beaches and incredible prices. The tourist ghetto is Khao-San road - a great cheap place to get a room for your first night. . .in the morning, you can catch a bus to one of a few exotic locations near a beach for a few days. Personally, I find Thai food the best in Asia. Thailand needs at least a week to really soak in the sun and beach. . .just a wonderful place.
