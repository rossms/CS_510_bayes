A visit to the Butterfly Pavilion is like a trip into the rain forest. Butterflies are flying around in a natural environment and, if you're lucky, they'll land on you! (Be sure to wear bright colors.) You also get the chance to hold a tarantula and see a working beehive up-close. There are lots of hands-on activities for kids, but adults will find it just as entertaining.
