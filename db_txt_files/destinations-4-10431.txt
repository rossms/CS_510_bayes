I am a die hard newport smoker. I will say they are stong, even if you have smoked them for 10 years. I do not think they have fiber glass in them. And in regards to not being able to run because your lungs a messed up, thats what smoking does and its something you have to accept.Although,when you smoke newports you can feel stuff in you lungs after a few cigarettes which is kind of unhealthy. I would not smoke anything else!
