I Think That Cedar Point Is The Best Amuesment Park In The World. It Is A Family Fun Place. I Went There All Of My Life And I Absoulutly Love It. It's Got Rides For All Ages From Kiddy Land To The Top Thrill Dragster. The View Of The Park Is So Pretty And Cool As You Drive Up The Road. I Think You Will Love It If You Go.
