Its not the best city in the country but it certainly isn't the worst. It is an ideally located city. It is a big city with a small town feel (due to its many neighborhoods). There is a high amount of crime (like in just about every US city). Philly is not NY, SF or Miami, but it is not the dump that it was 15 or 20 years ago. It is a city that is steadily progressing.
