I've watched him play on TV, seen him play live at the Pro Bowl, and recently went to the Chargers' Minicamp. This guy is incredible!!! He is also a great person, which is evident in his various charity organizations, as well as what he continues to do for the children. Definitely a great player on the field and equally that off the field.
