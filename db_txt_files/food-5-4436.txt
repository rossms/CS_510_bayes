My absolute favorite cheese--this is for the people who like a nice, sharp taste for their cheeses, this is a pretty classic, versatile cheese. This is definately one of the cheeses you can eat on its own, and is wonderful with summer sausage and a good cracker. If you prefer something softer, smoother and milder, this is probably not for you. But, if you're not going to eat yours, I'll gladly eat it for you!
