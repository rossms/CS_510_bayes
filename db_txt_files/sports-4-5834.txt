LaVell Blanchard is a great young player, and he'll be Michigan's backbone this season. Last year Blanchard led the Wolverines in scoring (14.4) and rebounding (7.9) in his rookie season and was honored as the Big Ten's Freshman of the Year by both the coaches and the media. And just recently he was selected to the pre-season All-Big Ten team. After losing some quality players from last year's team (Jamal Crawford, Brandon Smith, Kevin Gaines, Leland Anderson), Michigan is especially lucky to have Blanchard on the court. Let's hope he can help start Michigan's climb back to basketball respectability.
