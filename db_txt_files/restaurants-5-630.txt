Krispy Kreme ran Dunkin Donuts out of my entire region. By far a superior doughnut. The glazed are light and fluffy and delicious when warm. The dough in general has a much softer texture than DDs brand. If you want delicious fresh doughnuts served hot there is none better. Everyone should try a fresh glazed Krispy Kreme doughnut.
