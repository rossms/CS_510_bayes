I have never read a bad book written by Sue Grafton. All of her Kinsey Millhone mysteries are top notch. It is very refreshing to read about a detective who carries a purse. I just wish there were more letters in the alphabet, because I don't want her to stop with 26 novels. My advice, though, is to try and read them in order, because each one builds on the last. And, the endings are always surprises.
