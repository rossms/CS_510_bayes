Westminster Abbey is one of those places that give you goose bumps visiting. The place is steeped in English history in many ways. It is where the king or queen is coronated. It is where many royals, over the years, have been buried. As well, many actors and authors are buried here. There is a special tribute to Britain's great friend: Franklin Delano Roosevelt. I don't think you can visit Westmister Abbey and not be moved by the enormity of life that is represented there.
