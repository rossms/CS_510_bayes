Right around the time this movie was in the theatres, I got a summer job in Washington state, and a family took me in as their house guest. They had a spoiled brat daughter whose looks and behavior were so similar to Veruca Salt, that it was almost scary. If that movie didn't keep reminding me of her, I probably could have given it 5 stars.
