Newport is Rhode Island's gem. Just approching it is grand going over the Newport Bridge which is long and has a magnificent view of the bay dotted with sailboats. Downtown is very charming full of New England seaport type archetecture, great restaurants, and trinket shops. The beaches are nice (even nicer in nearby South County) and the Ocean Drive is stellar. To top it off there are America's castle's. Impressive mansions fit for royalty line the rocky shores of Newport. Surprisingly it doesn't feel too pretentious. I love it here.
