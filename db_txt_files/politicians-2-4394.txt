Hmm...I'd be very wary of this lady. She has style and class but has stated that she fully supports the Administration's hardline policies. Time will tell what her approach will be as international diplomat and representative of Bush's ideas; somehow I think her inexperience will turn to abrasiveness. I suspect Colin Powell knew what he was up against and bailed out before it gets really sticky.
