This school has some very good departments, but has to upgrade its graduate schools if it ever wants to achieve top-shelf status. Very nice campus and adequate facilities. Burlington, VT is one of the most pleasant college towns in North America, and there is a very good town/gown atmosphere going on. The campus is overpopulated with skibum undergrads, as can be expected. It appears this place would be a positively great place to teach.
