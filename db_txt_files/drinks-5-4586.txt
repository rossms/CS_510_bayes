I love Coca Cola. It tastes great just plain, or even with some JD or Vodka in it (for an evening beverage). :) It goes with practically any food, and it's available everywhere. It beats Pepsi hands-down. And I don't understand those people out there that can't tell a difference between Coke and Pepsi. Are you high?? There's a distinct difference. LOL. As for my tastes, Coke wins every time.
