As an adult I am embarrassed to admit this, but I still love Peanut Butter Cap'n Crunch! Its divine combination of peanut butter, sweetness, and crunch lures me back for a second bowl every time (I am convinced it contains addictive properties). Even my cats go to great lengths to steal it from my bowl. This cereal has a very short shelf-life at my house!
