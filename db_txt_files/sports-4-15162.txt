A relentless pass rusher who doesn't get a 5 because he doesn't play the run very well. More than getting to the passer, Douglas seems to get to the passer when it matters. Take his hit against Sean King in the Bucs / Eagles '00 Wild Card game - King and the bucs were never able to recover from that one hit and subsequent fumble. Douglas is apparently a good guy to have in the locker room as well.
