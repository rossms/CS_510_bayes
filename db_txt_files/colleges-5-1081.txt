Actually I think Cartecay was saying that the suicide rate is low at Cornell. With Cornell's larger size with respect to the other Ivies, it's easy to see why many suicides (and rather interesting ones at that) would get big press! I wish there was a way Cartecay could have not rated Cornell, but I guess she thought a 3 was a neutral rating. Not so! A five is a neutral rating for my dear alma mater.
