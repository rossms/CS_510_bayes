I visited Stone Mountain just before the Peach Bowl in 2002. It was absolutely beautiful! I'm from the north, and seeing Stone Mountain really gives you understanding as to why the South has so much pride in itself. The mountain itself is beautiful, and the surroundings of it were awesome. It is a must see when visiting Georgia.
