Hannibal largely failed to live up to its promise and was a lackluster followup to one of the most renowned psychological thrillers of all time. Despite being blessed with an explosive cast (including the underrated Gary Oldman), Hannibal deeply suffers in both plot and direction. The film was much too slow and in the end was quite a disappointment. Furthermore, although Julianne Moore gave a decent effort, the film was not the same without casting Jodie Foster as Clarice Sterling.
