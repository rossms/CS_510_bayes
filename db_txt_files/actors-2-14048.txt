Ironically, the most interesting thing about Anne Heche is how boring she is. For someone who was all over the news a while back, she just doesn't do or say anything especially unique. So she's gay and dating Ellen DeGeneres. So she's done a couple boring movies. So what? I don't dislike her, but I would be perfectly happy never hearing about her or seeing her ever again.
