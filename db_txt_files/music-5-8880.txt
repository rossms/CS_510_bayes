When I first saw this video, I had heard a little about Alicia Keys as an up-and-coming artist. But I was really impressed with how natural she seemed onscreen. She also impresses me with her style - she shows very little flesh but manages to look so classy and sexy. Girl got soul! I love the video and the album.
