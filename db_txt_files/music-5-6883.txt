If you don't like or know much about jazz, but would like to indulge in a good introductory jazz record, pick this one up. Listen to it like you would any pop record- don't consider it to be dinner music, or whatever, just turn it up and get caught up in its serene splendor. Kind of Blue is a beautiful piece of Davis', John Coltrane's, and the rest of the musicians' hearts.
