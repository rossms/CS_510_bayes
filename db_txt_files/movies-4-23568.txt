A ridiculous movie with giant plot-holes. . .but I love it. Manhattan Island as a prison for all of our felons? What a great idea! A cheesy but enjoyable movie. . .Kurt Russel as Snake Plissken is a classic. . .Also notice Lee Van Cleef (the bad from The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly) as the proto-company-man-bad-guy. My wife called this one The Ultimate Guy Movie.
