I really enjoyed this film of a son trying to reconnect and understand his dying father through his stories. Albert Finney was marvelous as the older Edward Bloom. Ewan McGregor was terrific and utterly charming as the young Edward Bloom and Billy Crudup was wonderfully cast as his son. He played the part so well as son so estranged from his father, but yet wanting to be so close. Tim Burton films are usually full of visuals, full of imagination with some humor thrown in the mix. This one is no exception. This is one film that will make you smile, make you laugh and pull at your heartstrings.
