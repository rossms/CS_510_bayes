Again, this is a book that appeared to be a 4 or 5 when it first appeared, but that suffered in the longer term view. The end result/insight was to pare your organization--to shrink yourself closer to the 20 percent who deliver 80 percent of your results. The book has had limited application, as contrast with a valuable book such as In Search of Excellence, which outlines some general principles that will lead a company to success, if not excellence. A good book in retrospect, but far from indispensable.
