This is my favorite whisky. I used to drink Crown Royal, but I switched when I tried a bottle of Ancient Age my dad brought over. It is just as smooth and has a little history to go along with it. Many of my friends now choose Ancient over other whisky's. It is also less expensive than some of the others. Ancient Age mixes well with Coke or 7-up. It has a high alcohol content and is not for the weak of stomach. Give it a try, I know you will enjoy!
