I have used Quicken for 10 years. The program works reasonably well but customer service, both online and in person is pathetic. In person I have much trouble understanding the person on the other end, but obviously outsourcing save them dollars. The online service rarely answers my question. I have just dropped Online Backup as a flash drive does it quicker and cheaper.
