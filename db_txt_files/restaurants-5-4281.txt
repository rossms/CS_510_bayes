One of the best Italian chains out there. The food is supreb, and the prices are less than the Olive Garden (by a lot). THere's no free salad though (however, it's very cheap $1.99 for any), but the bread is great (especially when you dip it in the olive oil). Service has always been great at any Macaroni Grill I've been too.
