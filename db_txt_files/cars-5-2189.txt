Superb car. My 90 TT has a few mods (computer, higher boost, exhaust) and pumps 400HP. I drive it every day with no probs. I paid $20k for it (Aussie dollars - that's about $10k US!) and it smokes just about everything bar Porsche turbos and Lambo's (don't come across those too often). Better value, looks and lineage than the Supra, although the Supra should probably becompared to the Nissan GT-R R33 (GT-R still comes up better). Where is the GT-R in the ratings???
