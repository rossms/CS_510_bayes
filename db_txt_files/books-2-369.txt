I found this book to be drawn-out, slow reading, and full of information that should be common sense for most people. Kiyosaki takes one little sentence and then turns it into an entire chaper. He worked for his friend's dad for free - he finally ends it after 52 pages. He tortures us for another 30 pages on the difference between an asset and a liability. This is a book that will not help too many people. It may change the way you think, but it's not worth the price.
