After Psycho, Hitch's attempt at the nature hooror film, and definitely the best of that type. I love the editing and camera work. The special effects are dated, but it is a very creepy movie. It creeps up on you - very good pacing. Never was much of a fan of Tippi Hedren, but the scene at the gas station where the man bursts on fire and the end when the birds have taken over the town really jolted me. I liked it more as a kid, but I give props to Hitch for his diversity. He's the precursor to people like Spielberg. You also see muchof Hitch's work in Kubrick.
