I don t usually get into the celebrity section, but saw this on the sites front page. It simply made me stop and think how much I really dislike this woman as an actress. I really don t know why, maybe it s her barracuda smile or the fact that she has never truly convinced me she successfully portrayed a part she played. When I see her in a movie, she just annoys me to no end. Even watched that Erin Brockovich thing what a pitiful job of acting, didn t even like the movie itself that much.
