A great city!!!!! My second home. Call it a mini New York. You can get just about anything there. A 24 hour party and the best food in the country. I have walked the French Quarter at 4 and 5 in the morning and never had a problem. My favorite Hotel is the Omni Royal,just one block from Bourbon but more quite.
