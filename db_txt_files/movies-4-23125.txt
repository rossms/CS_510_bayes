A huge fan favorite, bordering on recent cultish appeal, I have always loved this film. Jennifer Connelly in one of her first films is beautiful and shows early glimpses of the great actress she would become. David Bowie is delightfully dark and frightening (although it could have just been the spandex pants he wears throughout). The best part for me was definitely the incomparable characters from Jim Henson's workshop. As always his creations were fun marvels. Not to mention, George Lucas also teamed up on this film. A fantasy classic.
