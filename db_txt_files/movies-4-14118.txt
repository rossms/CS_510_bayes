It was about a little boy who got his own TV show without him knowing it. The whole world had their eyes on him. I didn't like how they planned his father's death when in reality he was still alive. It was cool that they were living in their own little world, it seems interesting, but I wouldn't want to be living in a world where all eyes were on me.
