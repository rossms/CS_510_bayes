Not my favorite state by a long shot. My most vivid memory of being there is the stench of paper mills. Then there's politics: any state where Saxby Bad Knees Chamblis can beat Max Cleland by impugning his patriotism has something seriously wrong somewhere. And then the're the Braves, like the Yankees only not as good. A one is tempting but I'll give em an extra star for Jimmy Carter and Flannery O'Connor.
