The Macaroni Grill is one of the better chain restaurants for Italian food. As some other comments have noted, the bread is excellent, especially with the peppered oil for dipping. The entrees are a step above the Olive Garden (for instance); however, the selection is more limited (if memory serves). The dining experience is a little off. The floor is well lit and cavernous, and the wait staff do this cute thing, writing their name on the table with a crayon. Nevertheless, given the competition, the Macaroni Grill ends up with four stars.
