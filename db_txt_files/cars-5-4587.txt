I own a '98 King Cab, and have found this to be a great little truck. It will be thoroughly tested on a road trip soon. The truck is built well, and stands up to the abuse of the streets in Dallas. It looks good, handles well, gets good milage, and is peppy enough not to get run over by most vehicles on the road. I have owned several Japanese built cars, and remain impressed still with this truck. I'd buy another one (Preferably the Supercharged Model.), if I could afford it. Right now, this truck is the one.
