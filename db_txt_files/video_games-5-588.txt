I love the game. No other game out there can test your intellect and analytical skills like Chess. It's impossible to complete an algorithm which can figure out the game. Chess goes beyond thought. Children should play chess to improve their ability to anticipate problems. It leads them to a concept that a proper defense is imperative before any type of attack, even in life.
