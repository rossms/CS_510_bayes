OK, I more than LOVE Kirk Hinrich. I watched him at KU and I still watch him in the NBA with the Chicago Bulls. If the Bulls didn't have this hottie, they wouldn't have a crowd like they do going to see them play. He always makes these cute little motions and gestures that just make me like him even more! But the thing that I like the most about him is his mouthguard! Kirk Hinrich is what I live for! I LOVE YOU KIRK!!
