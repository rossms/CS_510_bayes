How crazy is it that this guy has become a legitimate politician. It wasn't too long ago that the Rev was leading marches and libeling reputable people as he defended Tawana Brawley who claimed to have been raped and had feces spread on her by a bunch of white men. Utlimately, it was discovered that the entire story was concocted. Did Big Al ever apologize? Of course not. Nevertheless, even if you don't like him, you need to be a little impressed with how he has remade himself (hence, the 2 instead of a 1 ).
