Not a film I would normally rush to see but I'm very glad I saw this one. The cinematography and choreography is probably the best in the genre. It's flawless, exciting and keeps your eyes pinned to the screen. As for the story, it pans out well, keeping your attention but without telling all its secrets. However some of the violence felt a little gratuitous and then again some of it was almost comical. Superb acting from Uma Thurman who I had never really appreciated before. I'm definitely awaiting the next two installments.
