Yep, I love this place too! I'm kind of puzzled though since they have always featured an excellent selection and their high standards have remained constant, I've noticed some stores have been closing in my area. As others have mentioned before me, this is definately the place for those seeking excellent taste without the extreme richness of Haagen Dazs or Ben Jerry. The price is usually a bit more down to earth too since they are not burdened by a designer label. My usual order has always been a scoop of banana and a scoop of cherry. Num!
