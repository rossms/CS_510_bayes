Not that bad, but utterly lacking in character other than that it tastes more like lemonade than tea. Definitely too sweet, for my tastes. Seriously, it has as many calories as a soft drink! One thing I don't like is Snapple's pretentious attitude (e.g. slogans like Made from the best stuff on Earth (R) and things like Real Brewed and All Natural on their labels). They act like they're different from other mainstream beverages. But, as far as I can tell, they're virtually indistinguishable from any other high fructose corn syrup (or artificially) sweetened tea or fruit drink.
