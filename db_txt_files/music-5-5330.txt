The perfect mix of traditional country and great ballads. Actually, lukskywlkr, the song Only in America had already been released prior to 9/11 and this CD was already in the works. There were quite a few good songs on this CD, including When She's Gone, She's Gone , See Jane Dance , The Long Goodbye , There Ain't Nothing About You and a few others. Highly reccomended to anyone who likes this group- it truly is one of their best IMHO.
