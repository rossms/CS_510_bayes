I am thankful for growing up in the city of Philadelphia; not just for the awesome cheesesteaks and Veterans Stadium, but for being exposed to Black Cherry Wishniak. I frequently go to liquor stores, although still underage, to buy Stewart's by the cases. Although Frank's remains close to my heart, Stewarts definitely whets my palate just as effectively. Outstanding soda, dare I say the best!
