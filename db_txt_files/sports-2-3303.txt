One of the more overrated players in any sport. While I admit his strikeouts and no hitters were remarkable, he was extremely selfish. When a ground ball double play was what he and his team needed, he would walk a guy because he was trying so hard to strike him out. And that's nice that he was a family man, but I believe this category has nothing to do with life off the field.
