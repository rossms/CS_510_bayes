It's not bad in the way that Westlife albums are truly dire. It's just that it's all very laid back and one paced offering no surprises. It'd be good to see Norah cut loose and crank up the guitars and do something unpredictable. Ultimately it's anodyne background muzak for poncey middle class dinner parties.
