A rather boring movie. A story about good vs evil? Please. The movie could have been over in 5 minutes if Gary Cooper's character Will Kane had left town with his wife. Grace Kelly was rather stiff. Gary Cooper was fine. The most entertaining was Lloyd Bridges. The whole time I hear how evil this Frank Miller character was and he turned out to be a one note joke. I will say one of the best parts is when the towns people at the church voice their opinions on the whole matter. However there are better movies which deal with the issue of right and wrong.
