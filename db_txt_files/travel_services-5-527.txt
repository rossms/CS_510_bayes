A remarkably well organized airport. Easy to get into and out of - the L train runs from here to downtown in about thirty minutes for $1.75. The United terminal has one of the prettiest moving walkways around, with neon lights shining above. Lots of good food. The biggest problem at O'Hare is that it is prone to delays, because it's such a major transit hub. Fortunately, if you do have a layover here, there are actually things to see and do in the meantime.
