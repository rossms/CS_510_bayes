My friends and I thought this place was so great in high school. We would drive the hour and a half trip to the closest one and shop at the nearby mall, then eat dinner there. We just liked flirting with the waiters and being stupid while we were there. I actually don't remember what all I have tried there, but I do remember it was always good and decently priced. I also remember us dancing and singing very loudly. I am sure we got on most everybody elses nerves.
