This was a truly haunting book that I could not put down. I found myself incensed with some of the sheer stupidity and greed of the more novice climbers that put the lives of the Sherpas and more advanced climbers in danger. In his words I could feel the heavy burden and sense of guilt that Mr. Krakauer had placed upon himself. The novel seems as much as a catharsis as well as a remembrance of those who died.
