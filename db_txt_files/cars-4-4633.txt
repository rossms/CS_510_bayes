Having had the fortunate opportunity to be a professional test driver for both Ford Motor Company and General Motors, I have to give the F series by Ford one of the best trucks on the market today. The testing techniques of each company are so different, they can hardly be compared. The only company that tests as hard as Ford is Toyota. (awesome product in it's own) Take it from someone that knows, Ford makes one of the best pickups in the world.
