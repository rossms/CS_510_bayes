I live in Olympia, Washington, and I'm probably the only Republican in the city. So I like eastern WA because it doesn't seem to support abortions or let off sex-offenders easily like many politicians from the Western half. But other than that, I hate eastern WA. Western WA is awesome because 1) it rains like crazy 2) there's Seattle 3) beautiful Pacific Ocean beaches and 4) great sports (yeah...I said they're great, and I mean it). Washington also has the most beautiful mountain in the U.S.: Mt. Rainier.
