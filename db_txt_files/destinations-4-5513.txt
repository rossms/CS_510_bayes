Very pretty state with tons to do outdoors. As pointed out by other posters, one of the interesting things about this state is how well the very liberal and redneck folks get along. There are even a large number of redneck hippies- kinda of hard to explain, but if you live in Oregon, you know what I mean. Central Oregon is my favorite spot because it is dry. The Coast is very pretty, but very wet. Portland is a nice town. Worst thing about Oregon is the economy which is not great.
