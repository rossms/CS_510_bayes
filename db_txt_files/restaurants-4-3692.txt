The pizza's good, especially the deep-dish. However, they seem to skimp on the toppings. I don't know why they want to be stingy with the sausage, come on....they've got some pretty good sides, though. I'd eat the buffalo wings by themselves with a side of cheesy bread--there's a meal right there. Those new Chicken Kickers they've got aren't bad either. They're not as fast as Papa John's and the pizza's decent, but they'll do the trick if I'm in the mood for some wings.
