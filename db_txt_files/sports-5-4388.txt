Roy Williams is one of the best if not the best coach currently coaching and is one of the greates of all time. He has an amazing mind for the game and is a teacher and a motivator. He has great relationships with his players and he cares about them most players will love to have that kind of a coach, he will get a championship soon, he is too good of a coach not to. I just hope those kids at UNC think it will be the way it was with Daughtery there, no no no.
