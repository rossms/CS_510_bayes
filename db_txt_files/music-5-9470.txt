This is my #1 favorite Album of alltime! Michael is still the king of pop in spite of what has been happening to him in court. This album will never be topped by anyone else, that is how great and how awsome this album is. Who could ever forget the great BEAT IT, how woudl Thriller be great without BILLIE JEAN. It was the right time and a great moment for Michael Jackson.
