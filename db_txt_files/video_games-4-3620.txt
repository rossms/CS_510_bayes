This is a really fun driving game. This weekend was the first time that I have ever played this game and I had a good time after an initial frustration phase. It was kind of hard to get used to because the buttons for turning are very sensitive. Also, you have to slow down right before you go around a corner. It doesn't slow down your race at all, it actually makes you perform better since you don't crash. I really liked playing it. The graphics are great and you get to choose the color and make of the car you drive.
