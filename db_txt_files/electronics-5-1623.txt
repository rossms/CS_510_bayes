Well it depends what year you got your set..in the old days a tv lasted 20 yr. Nowdays you had better buy the warranty and let Circuit city fix or replace it when it breaks down. Anyway I have found these to be good quality sets. I've fixed a few..you have to use factory panasonic parts..otherwise you can have problems later on. So be careful if you take it to your corner repair shop..don't let them put in cheap parts.
