Without a doubt, Russell Crowe is one of the outstanding actors of his generation. His role as James J. Braddock in The Cinderella Man really does a lot to bolster that arguement. But in light of todays news that he was arrested in New York today for throwing a telephone at a hotel clerk and then punching him, in typical Crowe fashion, I have to say I'm really disappointed in him as a man. A couple of years ago he had his bodyguard hold a photographer while he punched him out. Great actor, Lousy guy! Too bad he didn't learn anything from Braddock.
