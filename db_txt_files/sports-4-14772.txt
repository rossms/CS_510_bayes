I hesitated between the 3 and 4. Emmitt was a very good back, could both run and catch, though as a receiver there are a few of his contemporaries who would rate higher. Durable. Though the one stat that makes me give him a 3.5 is something that I' not sure is an official one, but the announcers seemed to have acess too. He was consistently the NFL back who had most yards per carry prior to being touched by the opposition. This shows his line cetainly was responsible for much of his yardage. Definitely not in the same class as Brown, Payton, Dickerson, Sanders, Sayers
