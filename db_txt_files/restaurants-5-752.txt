I love going to Dairy Queen in the summers or in the winter after basketball games. It's much better than other fast food restaurants. The workers are nice, its clean, and inexpensive. There are so many blizzards to choose from- my two favorite is peanut butter Oreo. There are zillions of flavors for sundaes, my favorite being raspberry. And when you ask for extra on something, they make sure to do exactly that!
