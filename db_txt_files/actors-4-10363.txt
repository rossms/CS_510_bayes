A wonderful actress who unfortunately got a little pigeon-holed after Titanic, she now makes wonderful decisions about the roles she plays. Choosing smaller, indie roles, she gives every performance enormous heart and depth. Unconventionally beautiful, she is magnetic on the screen. I hope to see her gain some acclaim and escape the titanic shadow.
