Jim was the best thing to ever happen to Buffalo. He was and is a class act. I have never seen anyone lead a team like he did...no deficit was to great to overcome (even if he was on the sidelines watching due to an injury - i.e., the greatest comeback in NFL history, Thanks Frank!)... Off the field, I never saw him turn away a child...he was always gracious and caring to the little fans. I was there when he walked on the field, was there when he said good bye and was there when he got his rightful place in the Hall of Fame....
