I visited Cozumel when I went on a three day cruise to Mexico. As expected, Cozumel in the spring time is extremely hot. If you plan to go shopping, don't expect the stores to have air conditioning. Bargaining is fun, but the locals will try to take advantage of you if you do not speak Spanish. You will see a stark difference because of the finacial difference between the U.S. and Mexico.
