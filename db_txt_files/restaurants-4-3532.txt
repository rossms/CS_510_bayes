Has its fans, although reputation varies. Known for their thin, specially-seasoned crust and their edge-to-edge plentiful toppings. Not as filling, in comparison to deep dish. Nice for a change, but I always come back to a couple home-based pizzerias here in Cincinnati (Dewey's and LaRosa's) which are more highly regarded here than any large chain.
