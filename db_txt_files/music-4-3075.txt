This 3-record set on 2-CDs album is probably the best collection of Neil Young songs that's available. My only disappointment is that some of his best, like My My, Hey Hey (Out of the Blue) and Don't Let It Bring You Down, aren't included. Otherwise, I would have definitely given it a 5-star rating.
