McDonalds is fine. I love there Big Mac,Quarter Pounders and regular cheeseburgers. Been eating them since a kid.....and believe it or not...Im not fat or in a lawsuit with them because I was so ignorant or shamfull as to say i didn't know that ice cream and burgers eaten every day for years might just make me fat. I do hope the judge holds all responsible who filed this frivolous action which he has the power to do.
