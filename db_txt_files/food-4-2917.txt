Pretty unhealthy, but there's something absolutely wonderful about biting through the delicate, crunchy wafer cookie and tasting all the different textures, from the thin layer of chocolate spread between the two wafers back to the second wafer. The chocolate taste isn't overpowering and the simple but tasty cookies provide a good base for the rich inside. Unlike Snickers or Twix bars, say, where the chocolate and fillings just ooze out, Milano cookies are a perfect, light snack for those who don't care about lots of sugar and fat in their diets.
