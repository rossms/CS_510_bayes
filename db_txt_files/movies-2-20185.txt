 It is sad to say that I thought this was a cute movie. It sure is better than 3-5. It takes a different road away from the same old tired teenagers in all the past sequels and puts us with brand new ones. I laugh my ass off when Carlos says The map says we're fu*ked! and when Freddy says Nice hearing from ya...Carlos! This is good to watch with friends.
