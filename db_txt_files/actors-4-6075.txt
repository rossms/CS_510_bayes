I thought that he was excellent in Traffic as the idealist Mexican cop. His strength as an actor is in his expressions - he was able to convey a lot of complex emotions through his facial expressions and body language. Even more impressive was his ability to master Mexican slang and intonation, even though he was raised in Puerto Rico. Hopefully we'll be seeing a lot more of Benicio.
