i don't like it. i usually drink Coors LIght when i'm going broke and can't afford something better. it tastes sweet, as if sugar were added to it. maybe it's the can, i thought. well, i poured it into a big pint glass and the stuff was still not good. if you have to drink light beer, i would recommend a bud light or miller light. before this junk
