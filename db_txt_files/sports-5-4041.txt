Smith is a slightly weak 5 in my view. His NCAA tournament records are impressive and his greatest asset. Those very records are also his weakness since he had so many opportunities to win championships but did not. In 11 final four appearances he only managed 2 championships. That is a terrible percentage. I will mercifully give him 5 stars but some could argue his teams failed much too often to deserve that high rating.
