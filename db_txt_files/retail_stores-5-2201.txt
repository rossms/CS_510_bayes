PowerBen5000 nailed it. Aldi's is a great shopping option. Yeah you wont get name brands, but you can get the basics for cheap. There are some aspects about shopping there that are outside of the typical Supermarket experience, but that's a good thing. The best thing is the price. Man, after my first trip there I was wishing this place was open when I was in College. $20 can go a long way at Aldi's for pretty much the same things you'll get at a regular Supermarket.
