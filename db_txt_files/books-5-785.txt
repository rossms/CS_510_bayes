Harry Potter the Chamber of Secrets, is a good sequel novel to the first one. It answers many questions readers may have had, after Book 1, such as why Hagrid is the gameskeeper, or the keeper of the keys, and why Hagrid really got expelled from Hogwarts as a third year. I like the Whomping Willow, Erroll, Dobby and Dumbledore's bird, Fawkes, references too.
