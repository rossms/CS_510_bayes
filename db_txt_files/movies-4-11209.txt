I ignored the critics and decided to watch Saving Silverman on HBO. This is when I discovered that most movie critics, like weathermen, suck. The movie makes no attempt to be philosophical, which is fine by me. But critics hate pure comedies. And that's exactly what this movie is. All characters are EXTREMELY funny, and the duo of Jack Black and Steve Zahn couldn't get any better. The corniness of the plot prevents this movie from getting a five star rating. But forgive the plot...and you will be rewarded with some great laughs.
