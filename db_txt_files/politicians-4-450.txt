Tony does a good job as PM. He is managing the economy well with Gordon Brown and steering the UK in the right direction. Now it needs our inhabitants to perform to the same standards in our jobs (i.e. raise our productivity and efficiency) to really make Tony's legacy count in terms of a greater prosperity for our country.
