Bluetooth. Just having that in a phone automatically gets a high score from me. I don't know how I lived before Bluetooth. It made life so much easier. Aside from the Bluetooth, there are other features that make this phone worth every penny you pay for it. It's got a digital still camera that provides for some fun times with friends. It also has polyphonic ringtones, which you can transfer easily with the Bluetooth feature. It's big screen is great for the pictures you take. No real difference between this and the T637. Save some money and find a discounted T616.
