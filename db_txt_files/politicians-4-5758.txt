Hillary defending Black Panthers? I had no idea. It's just one more thing that makes me like her more. I know Rick Lazio's record in the State legislature, he's another brute who NEVER had an original idea, who never wrote any of the laws he sponsored as his own, who has consistently attacked the interests of the poor, and he's a vicious bully. Hillary is a better person and candidate than Lazio. She is just as experienced as any politician (8 years in the White House). And anyway, most politicians don't write the bills they take credit for.
