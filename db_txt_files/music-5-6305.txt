very, very good. admittedly, i don't always listen to the last few (past Lateralis), which is not so much that they're not as good as the rest of the cd, but that compared to the more complex preceding tracks they are a little too simple. i love the cd, i wouldn't change a thing about it, but although tracks Disposition, Reflection, and Triad are well done, they seem to be low-energy songs on a high-energy cd.
