As much as many people hate the Dallas Cowboys. It is not just the fact that this team over their entire history has made so many heart stopping plays or has been so successful. I love the Dallas Cowboys for their traditions, Tom Landry, Roger Staubach and Bob Lilly. The list of incredible players can go on forever. This team was started by a maverick character (Clint Murchison) and this team has represented him well. God Bless the Dallas Cowboys!
