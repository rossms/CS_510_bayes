She is not the worst I've ever seen, but the only time I liked her work was in Scream. She is pleasant to look at I suppose. Her biggest problem is that she has what I like to call a bitch-face . I would be willing to bet my mortgage that she is a supreme bitch off camera, just based upon the look in her eye. You know what I'm talking about; sorry to be vulgar about it but there is no other way to describe that look.
