So far I have only had one bad expereince at a Bob Evans location, ( I waited 10 minutes at the hostess podium to be seated while the hostess sat at the counter and drank soda blatently ignoring me, i eventually left). The manager handled it well i think and i was able to give them another try. I find the food to be good for the price, and the staff and management are usually very friendly. To those who maynot have been to a Bob Evans, try the baked potato cheddar soup with bacon and chives. its my personal favorite.
