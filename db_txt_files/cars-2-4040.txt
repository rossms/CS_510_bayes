This car/SUV bought on price and all wheel drive capability. Horrible piece of automotive technology. 2001 model year with 90,000 miles. Warranty has replaced; 1 Blown Radiator, 4 sets of wheel bearings F R, Rear Differential, Ingintion Coil, Plugs, Wires, Distributor, Front Shocks/Struts, Rotors and Pads all around, rear wiper motor, Timing Belt, rear door handle sticks constantly. I must say warranty is good and most parts replaced free but it spends a great deal of time in the shop. Don't buy one. SunapeeBomber
