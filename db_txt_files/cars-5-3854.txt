This is a great vehicle! Heavy in construction, air bags in front and side, even back passengers! Can pull up to 3600 lbs. Much better than the Jeep, and many of the Chevy SUV's in how it drives. Better safety rating than previous years, this year it carries a 5-star rating. Fun car to drive with heated seats, and lots of other amenities.
