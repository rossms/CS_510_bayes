Without a doubt the best player today...He stepped up on D and finally trusted his other teammates...He has grown to be the best....He hardly has any help...He's accomplished a lot this year...that's why he's the MVP of the league....There's no one close to him...Not even that punk Kobe or Vince....He'll lead his team to the championship one day....A.I. MVP for LIfe
