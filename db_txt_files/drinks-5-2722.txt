For those that say that all roasts taste the same, I challenge you to drink a Breakfast Blend and follow it with a French Roast! All-in-all you get what you pay for; a consistantly great product with generally excellent service. Try getting that at McDonalds, Wendy's, or the icky Caribou Coffee. The fact of the matter is that if you do not like Starbucks - just say the true reason and don't blame it on the coffee with a simplistic reason.
