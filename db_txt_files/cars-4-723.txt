I have always liked Diamondback bikes because they are light, and last forever. The gears have never given me problems and the seat is comfortable enough so that you don't have to shell out an extra twenty bucks to buy one of those gel seat cushions. If you want a mountain bike that will not give any problems, you should definitely get a Diamondback.
