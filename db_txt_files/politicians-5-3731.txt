Dear Governor Bush, I was wonder why you have not chosen any Chrisitans for your cabinet positions? As I am sure you reaize, it was the Christian support that help you win this election. In some voting areas it was as high as 32% of the vote. Plus, at this point it is the Christians who are praying and fasting for God will for your life and this eletion.
