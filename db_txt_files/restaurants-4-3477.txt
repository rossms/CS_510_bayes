Pizza Hut was a 5 in the beginning when it came to pizza, but then they changed their sauce when they came out with the New Yorker and it never was the same. The sauce was a bit sweeter and lost it's luster. My rating would be a 3.5 but since I can't do it I just don't have the heart to give it a 3 after all the great memories!
