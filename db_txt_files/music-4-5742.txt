For cheesy heavy metal schlock of the early 80's, this and Blizzard Of Oz were pretty cool. I remember liking Little Dolls(more specifically Tommy Aldridge's drum intro). It all sounds goofy and dated now, but it was cool when I was a kid. Ozzy never was worth a damn after the death of Randy Rhoads, not musically anyway.-- Johnny Roulette
