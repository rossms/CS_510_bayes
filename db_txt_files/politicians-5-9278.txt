It makes me sick to see how unappreciatively Gerald Ford's duty and service to this country is looked upon. A man of extraordinary courage and loyalty, he sacrificed his career in a single act of courage because it was right for the country, I can only pray that in time he will get the credit that he most certainly deserve.
