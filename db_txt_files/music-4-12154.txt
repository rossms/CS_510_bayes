This was Aaliyah's third and final album before she tragically died on August 25th in a plane crash. The two outstanding tracks on 'Aaliyah' are 'We Need A Resolution' (featuring Timbaland) and 'Rock the Boat'. The rest is good too and was only a taste of what Aaliyah had in store for the future. Sadly, we won't hear any new music from her in the future as she is no longer with us physically. She was only 22. Rest In Peace, Aaliyah Dana Haughton (January 16, 1979 - August 25, 2001)
