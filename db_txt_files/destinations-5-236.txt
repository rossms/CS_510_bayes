Hanoi has charm and energy and great noodle soup ( pho ). Try the corner of Nguyen Du and Pho Hue streets for tasty pho. Hang Gai is called silk street, where you can buy very decent silk at good prices. Most of the trinkets sold are hits with friends when you get home - like the wooden frog instrument. Rent a bike and ride around at 11pm (without much money in your pocket). The traffic is minimal and the air is cleaner.
