Of course Keybank charges a fee when irresponsible customers overdraw their account. EVERY BANK DOES! Get a grip and stop whining about you not balancing your checkbook and blaming it on someone else. Or better yet, get overdraft protection so when you mess up, you don't get charged and end up looking for someone else to blame it on!
