How about a rating from someone who actually goes to the school? By the way, anyone who gives one star ratings to a school that is ranked 9th in the nation is either an idiot or cannot count to 5. Washington University is a great school. The academics are top notch, the campus is one of the most beautifully landscaped in the country, the people are caring and helpful, and the dorms and food are excellent. I hope that no one is deciding whether or not to go to this school based on what some morons are saying on these boards.
