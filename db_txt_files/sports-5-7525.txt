Another underrated player from an underrated era (although not as underrated as his teammate Cliff Hagan, who isn't even listed!). Yes, he was rail thin and would have to lift weights to compete in today's league, but it's not that hard for a player to put on 20-30 pounds with today's weight training programs. Especially a player with Petit's work ethic. He was easily every bit as good as Duncan is today.
