Best freshman college player ever, and top 5 impact players ALL TIME. First and only freshman to lead a team to a national championship. Case closed. And by the way, KU fans, Carmelo only had 7 points in the second half, (with a bad back) so don't blame your loss that it was all Carmelo. It was actually Josh Pace Craig Forth and Billy Edelin that made the difference. (Hakim's block didn't hurt either.)
