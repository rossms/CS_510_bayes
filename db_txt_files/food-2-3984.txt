This came to my local Swedish shop last year as well. Since I had a special occasion to celebrate I decided to spend some money and buy a more expensive brand (i.e Kettle Chips). Sadly these chips were so salty, so fat and so fried that after finishing half the bag I felt a serious need to throw up. And don't get me wrong I'm can finish a 200g Estrella in 1 hour or less. But something about the way these were made just put me off chips for a while. I still haven't given these another shot, and doubt I ever will.
