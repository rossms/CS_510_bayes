The numbers are worth bragging about. How much credit he deserves is an issue with me. Carnell Williams and Ronnie Brown for Auburn make more people miss and split the carries. Would post much more impressive numbers if not sharing the load. Peterson is impressive as a freshman but not the best back in football.
