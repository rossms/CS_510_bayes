When it came time for me to buy my first new vehicle, I chose Toyota because my ex-boyfriend's father had an ancient Toyota truck that he swore by. So I bought a 1999 Tacoma 4x4 extracab automatic and it's been wonderful! I have now put 108,000 miles on it, have been pretty hard on it by doing alot of 4x4 offroading (I still love to play in the mud!), and the only problem I have with it is that the horn sounds wussy. :) Great looking, great running truck!!!
