This is a bought team with a ridiculous payroll, but as far as the players go, they are very good. It's natural to go where the money is. Clemens, Pettite, Wells, and Mussina, all make up a strong pitching staff. Jeter is a decent shortstop, Posada is an okay cather, Giambi can hit homers, Bernie Williams is good, Matsui will learn how to hit American pitching.
