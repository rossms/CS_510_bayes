All of you that put Gardner as terrible.. Hahah..you guys are so ignorant. Jason Gardner is GOD compared w/ the rest of the point guards in the NCAA. He is the greatest! I'm a 16 year old girl and I even know this. And to all of you that put that my boy is great, MUCH props to ya. Just remember- JASON GARDNER = GOD!! GO WILDCATS!
