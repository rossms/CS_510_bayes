What short memories people have. I know his personal life is a whole different can or worms, but this album stands as the flagstone for eighties pop music. With Quincy Jones at the producing chair, Michael Jackson turns in one great performance after another. Beat It, Billie Jean, The Girl Is Mine, Human Nature, 7 top ten singles off an album that just had nine songs in the first place. That, at the time, was unheard of. This thing sold over 40 million worldwide and is the best selling album of all time.
