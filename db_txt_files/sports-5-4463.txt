Whenever I ask any of my friends to name the school that they would choose to go to to play big-time college hoops, Duke is consistently the choice. And, Coach K is the primary reason. Not only does he win year in and year out, but he does so with such dignity, class, and grace. No other coach is able to combine passion and compassion like he can. Whether he is on his knees in front of his bench imploring his team to play defense or crying at a news conference because one of his seniors is graduating, Krzyzewski is the model of what all coaches should be.
