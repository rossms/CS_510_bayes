you had my vote till you picked dick as your VP. knowing the success of assasinations on the presidents of this country, the fact that you are up there in years and heart attacks are common, well the very thought of cheney being MY president scares the holy hell out of me and if you win and something does happen, i'm defecting to europe. i'd rather take my chances there and of coarse never let anyone know i'm american. bad move bush, just bad.
