i love this game. ive been playing this shit for years. its the best 4 player melee game in the world. i used to think the first smash brothers was the best game in the world until melee came out and then melee became the best. i bought a gamecube for this game onlly. ive never owned, rented or even played any other games for the cube. no need when you have smash brothers. smash bros. rules!!!
