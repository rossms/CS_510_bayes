glad we went, and that it was not all inclusive.stayed at harmony suites, nice and not big bucks. fun things- taking the local taxi service for 75cents blaring caribbean music, horseback riding with country horseback thru banana plantations, scuba diving at jalousie. drawback-trying to get a cup of coffee at 8 am.
