I think I want to break something... I think every one of these crummy angst/metal/rap bands that are so popular in the new millenium ate a good dose of 'In Utero' and other Nrivana stuff with their milk for breakfast in their early years and are taknig advantage of it now. So influential and such intense music - that is the only way to describe this record. Kurt Cobain was the one figure in my 'youth' that I can remember where I was when he died. I do have to say that I am pretty darn impressed with what Dave Grohel has been able to accomplish with the Foo Fighter following the demise of nirvana.
