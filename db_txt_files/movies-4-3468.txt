U.S. Marshals is just as if not more compelling than The Fugitive. Jones as always steals the show, with good backup performances by Robert Downey Jr. and Wesley Snipes. Savvy and emotionless Sam Gerard (Jones) must chase an escaped convict (Snipes) who is out to prove his innocence. The plot is much the same as that of The Fugitive, with a few twists and turns here and there. Downey Jr. is quite impressive and he made an interesting (and quite surprising) transformation towards the end of the film. All in all, U.S. Marshals surpasses its predacessor in most areas with a decent cast and a solid story.
