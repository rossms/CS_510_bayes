Who could forget her completely believable performance as Ellen Ripley in the Alien films? She was the perfect protagonist in that film, and I really can't imagine anyone else playing that role as perfectly (can you picture someone like Julia Roberts or Michelle Pfeiffer playing that role?). Good performances in Ghostbusters and Dave as well.
