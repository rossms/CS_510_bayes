Overall we had a great time. Line got a little long on some of the rides. Only real complaint was the food prices. Bring your wallet. My family had a salad, my kids split a chcken tenders and I had the hot dog special. With drinks it was $32.00. Fries cold, salad fair, hot dog ok, very small portions.
