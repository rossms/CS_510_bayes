Marbury has 4 other brothers that played college ball. He is from Coney Island, NY (in Brooklyn), where everything is basketball. So obviously he has a strong background. Marbury is undoubtedly one of the premiere point guards in the league at this time. He has a sweet shot. I thought it was a mistake for the Nets to trade Marbury for Kidd, but clearly the trade has worked out perfectly for both teams. The Suns needed a player like Marbury and the Nets needed a player like Kidd. They are both great, it's just that their playing style is different and one team can benefit from one but not the other.
