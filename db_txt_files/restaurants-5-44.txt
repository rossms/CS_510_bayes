I have been to many coffee shops and I liked most of them, but not for the quality of the coffee. I generally like a place because it is nice to hang out in, or they have funky flavorings. Not so with SBC- they make serious coffee. I went to Seattle once and let me tell you they have a coffee shop on just about every other corner. By far of all the ones I went to SBC had the best coffee. That's when I became a caffeine junkie.
