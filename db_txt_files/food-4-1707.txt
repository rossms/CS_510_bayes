They're not the end-all, but they have a very satisfying texture and taste. Just chewy enough to be satisfying, but not so much work that you don't want to bother. I don't know if it's just where I live, but the Red Vines brand of licorice always tastes stale and my jaw hurts after eating a few pieces. It always seems petrified and nasty. Give me Twizzlers any day. It has a weird, yeasty goodness--but that's what I like about it.
