i went there several years back. philippinas and philippionos (and a lot of other asians) are sweet people. yes, there are some screwed up ones that make really wrong decisions for the goverment, but the ones that feel they don't have a say, the good, innocent ones, they are so giving, even if they only own a loaf of bread, they will give you half. they hardly ever complain and they are so hospitible and welcome you into their home.
