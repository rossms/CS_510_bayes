Overall, this album is definetely an improvement from the two albums before it, though it's still quite a ways from their debut. This album is kind of repetitive and not all of the songs have the same impact as other, but there are some really great songs like Here to Stay, Hollow Life, and Alone I Break. This album is solid, has a good sound and I'd recommend buying if you like what you've heard from them.
