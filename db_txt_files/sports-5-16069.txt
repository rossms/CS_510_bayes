Everyone considers Green a great back yet he is still underrated. Ask someone what constitutes a high fumbles per touch average and they won't know what the hell you are talking about. Well thankfully some baseball fans follow football and can do math. A. Green is actually better than league average at holding on to the football fumbles/touch. Look it up!
