Only the folks that dont know about Jersey give it a bad rap, I have lived in 10 states, Jersey is fine.. where else can you live and take a ferry to the greatest city on earth, we have the appalachian trail to the central park trails to the streets of hoboken to the country roads of bernardsville... give it a break you pessimists, the grass is always greener
