One of the best Psychology schools in the nation. Has a beautiful campus, people are friendsly, dorm food isn't bad at all, dorms themselves are nice (except for the guys bathrooms- BEWARE). In regard to IU being a the #1 party school, what are you talking about?? An idiot took the poll. Sure you can find parties to go to on the weekends, but then again, where can one not find a party?? Get real people. There are going to be lots of parties at any college.
