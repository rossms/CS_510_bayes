Brooks Robinson made the most ridiculous defense plays look routine. Just unbelievable reflexes. 16 gold gloves and no one ever did it better. Just take a look at the 1970 world series when he single handidly won the championship with both his bat and his glove. Pete Rose said Brooks played 3rd like he came down from a higher league. He's the best 3rd baseman ever to play the game. And he's one hell of a human being.
