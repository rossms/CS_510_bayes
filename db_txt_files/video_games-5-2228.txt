While in your dorm room or at your apartment, this game is great for stirring up conversation and friendly competition. Try this ( The Dinner Circuit ): Play 4 player and who ever comes in last place after a circuit has to buy or cook dinner for the other 3 players. I have earned Chinese food and Whoppers from my roomates. Ready, set....EAT!
