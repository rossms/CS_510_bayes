There's no 4 cylinder sports car out there that can compete with a celica Gt-s look wise and/or performance wise. I love driving my car. I have raced so many cars, I can't count on my fingers and toes including, Rsx type S, Integras, tiburons, srt-4, accords, and many more i outran them all, i'm not saying that statistically my car is faster then all of them no, but once i hit the corners... BYE,BYE... Crazy handling, accelerates very fast, especially with the variable valve timing which kicks in at bout 6000 rpms... It's a car you must have if you're into sports cars, TRUST ME.....
