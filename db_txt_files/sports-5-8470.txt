i love jason kidd.he's areally good leader.he always is the one that picks up the rest of the team when they are down.no matter what you can always count on him.he plays with a lot of determination and heart.he's not a cocky show off like a lot of other players.he's always making things happen on the court and 10 steps ahead of everyone else.
