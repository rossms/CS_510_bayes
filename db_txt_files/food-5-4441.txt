A good quality sharp cheddar can really wake up the old taste buds. I love this cheese! Very versatile it blends well with just about anything from soup to nuts. Some tell me it s even good on hot apple pie. I ll take their word for that since I can t stand the thought of ruining a good slice of cheese this way since I don t care for pie.
