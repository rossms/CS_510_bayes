Colin Powell is overrated; is not someone I could support since he was so willing to run with Bush. I hope he can pull himself away from that Republican dark hole; but his military training may not let him change his nature enough to really help America. In his position as Secretary of State., I'd like to see how he helps Ireland, Africa and some of the other 3rd world countries. Katie V.
