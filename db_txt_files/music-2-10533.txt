A lot of 80s bands were bad about doing this - releasing one or two albums and their next LP is a greatest hits package, which only means one thing - he's trying to squeeze out another album so it'll fulfill his contract. He really must be in a creative funk. Not enough albums to have a greatest hits package, simply put.
