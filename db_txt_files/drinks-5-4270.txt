Bacardi (light) is my ultimate drink (always mixed with Coke). I usually add a lime on the side (with the lime, it's called a Cuba Libre). I can drink about six to eight in a night, and have a great time. Bacardi Rum is the only alcohol that no matter how many times I get sick off of it, I can still drink it time and again. As far as alcohol goes, Bacardi Rum is also one of the cheaper name brand liquors you can buy. I've tried many other brands of Rum, and Bacardi is by far the best.
