A family member recommended the first book of this series, and I now have all of the available volumes. I enjoy anything even remotely apocalyptic in nature, and this series is about as 'end of the world' as you can get. The writing style is a little basic, but since the authors are attempting to reach a large group of readers, I've overlooked the 'dumbing down'. The story itself is quite exciting, especially during several key events, and, despite the heavy Christian flavour, I've enjoyed every single book. Ultimately: it's super preachy, but worth a look.
