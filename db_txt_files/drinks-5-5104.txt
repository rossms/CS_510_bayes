Pepsi is by far my favorite cola. It has just the right taste.... I think it tasted alot better in the 16 oz glass bottles however. It tastes really flat in the plastic bottles, how I wished they would reintroduce the glass bottles permanently. But this basically goes with all soda....they ALL taste better in glass bottles. Cans are ok, but still don't beat the bottle flavor.... but it is nothing like Coke, which tastes crappy in everything but glass...
