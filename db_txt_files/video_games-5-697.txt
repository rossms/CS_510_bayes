I love strategy although this game played in it's basic form can eventually become monotonous. There are many rule variations that you can use to make the game much more dynamic. Rahter than list them all I will put in a link to a site that lists them (at least 30) some of which will make you think differently. http://www.edcollins.com/stratego/stratego-rule-variations.htm
