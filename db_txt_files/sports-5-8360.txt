Well, he's now just about unguardable. If he can drop 40 on Tayshaun, he can drop 40 on anybody, and at any time. Not sure if there's a better player in the league. ****Anybody see him elevate and dunk over Jermaine O'Neal last night? Holy smokes... when he gets a little better handle and a little more consistent on the J, he will be unguardable.
