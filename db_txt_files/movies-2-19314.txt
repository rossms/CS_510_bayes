Not a very good follow up to such a good horror movie. But how many follow up are? Friday the 13th sequels are party movies. You watch and laugh and make fun of those kids who haven't seen them before and jump whenever Jason pops up. This movie is pretty brain dead and you can watch it without having to strain your brain for you IKWYDLS fans. Cute follow up though. Just not a good movie by any standards. Fun movie for you and your crew.
