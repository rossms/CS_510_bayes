If I could remember back to the first time I tried this (or any whiskey for that matter) I would rate them all a 2 or 3 - but that was then. I love drinking Jack Daniels straight or with a splash of ginger ale and as much as I love other whiskeys like Woodford or Makers Mark for their characteristics, but there is a very mellow flavor with Jack Daniels that keeps me coming back all the time. I started drinking this as whiskey sours until the sour was no longer needed and never looked back.
