Four seperate games in one. I remember one stage you had to race around leaving trails behind you, trying not to hit the trails of the other racers. In another, you fought tanks. Another had you trying to blast your way trough a barriers that was coming down to crush you. I can't recall the fourth challange. You had to comlete all four tasks before moving on to the next level.
