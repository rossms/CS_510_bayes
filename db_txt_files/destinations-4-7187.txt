It may not get as much attention as Paris or Amsterdam, but Brussels is definitely worth a day or two, especially if you're traveling by train. The city may be a little more dominated by offices and sterile commercial districts, but it still has its old, traditionally European side. Don't leave town without trying Belgian mussels, frites, waffles, chocolate, and beer - all in one meal if you're daring.
