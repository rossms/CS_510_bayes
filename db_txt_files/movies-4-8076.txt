This is a top movie with many classic jokes from the legend Eddie Murphy. Murphy is a smart-allec cop who always has something to say and his two cop friends that he forms in LA are hysterical as their characters (gun-obsessed and unrisky). If you don't like Eddie Murphy's astonishing black-humour with his smart-allec improvisation avoid this. But, this is definate must see for all Eddie Murphy fans. An action-packed plot and strong characterisation, it's a action-comedy flick for the past, present and future. It has awesome music and will have you in stiches.
