Along with 'Dr. Strangelove', 'Full Metal Jacket' is Stanley Kubrick's masterpiece. Who can forget R. Lee Ermey's frightening portrayal of Sgt. Hartman and his bullying of Pvt. Pyle (Vincent D'Onofrio)? This movie pulls you in, and despite the second half being a tad bit lesser than the first half in overall quality, it is still a very good movie.
