OK, this is where the Child's Play saga lost all credibility. The first and second ones were remotely chilling, but this one was just plain stupid. Chuckie's spirit is instilled in a newly manufactured doll, and he is up to his old tricks again. Andy, now a teenager who is in military school, is still trying to overcome thr trauma that he endured years earlier at the hands of Chuckie. What follows is an idiotic storyline which is unlikely to scare a five year old. Pretty good if you're in the mood for a comedy, but this movie is by no means a horror film.
