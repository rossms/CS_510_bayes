I did not think Adelaide was anything special, though the restaurants and nightlife were decent. But the real treasure lies about an hour south of the city -- Kangaroo Island. Its a little pricey to get to, but you will fing the best animal life Australia has to offer on the island. I spotted tons of Koala, emus, wallabies, seals, sea lions, snakes and a host of others. Mahe the effort to visit this island if you are in the neigborhood.
