Hey! It is more than the city. Upstate is great. We have mountains, lakes, and the largest state park. I am from NYC but I get up all the time. Every ethnic group is represented, and we have more Native Americans too (including my family). If you have never been upstate you have missed a great part of geography, history, and people of the New York (and the rest of the US too). Come visit.
