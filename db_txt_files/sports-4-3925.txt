In those dark ages, before the invention of the designated hitter, all pitchers in both leagues were also hitters. Drysdale might have been the best hitting pitcher since Babe Ruth, always leading all pitchers in both leagues in home runs. As a pitcher, he maintained that he needed to own the outside corner. Like Bob Gibson, Juan Marichal and several others of his day, he did that by being unafraid to establish the inside corner and in particular the upper corner. I first heard the phrase chin music in reference to Don Drysdale.
