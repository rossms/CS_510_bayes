As there is no RateItAll description for this software, Excel is a spreadsheet program primarily used for working with and manipulating numbers (eg financial statements, reports and graphs). I have used other spreadsheet programs (ie Lotus and Quattro); however, Excel seems to be the most powerful and intuitive. Moreover, Excel seems to be the standard for most offices which means proficiency in this software is virtually a necessity to survive in the modern office environment.
