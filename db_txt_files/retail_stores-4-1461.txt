meijers dept. store is a very nice place to shop and everything is available. The staff is polite and very helpful. The only concerns that I have is the time it takes to get through the check out line. I was in the newest meijer store in columbus,ohio off of Broad street at waggoner road, The lines weren't that long, but the checkout was so slow. This is the only thing that needs to be addressed. Thank you. Peggy Gaiters august 5,2004
