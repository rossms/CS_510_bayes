Well, the Kings have finally done it - obtained a player as objectionable as their fans. I used to feel the same way about Sacramento as I do Detroit. Namely, the fans are garbage but you've got to like the way the team plays ball. And Rick Adelman has paid his dues in the league. He's coached a lot more winners than losers. Also, it would be nice to see Abdur-Rahim get into the playoffs some time prior to his 45th birthday. The above, however, was all before they obtained Ron "TruWarier" Artest. As far as I'm concerned they now fall into the same category as Fresno State, the Raiders and LSU.
