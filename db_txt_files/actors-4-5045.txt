Matthew Broderick never struck me as a good actor until I saw Glory . His performance as Robert Shaw in that film was so breathtaking- one of the best I've seen. His film, Ferris Bueller's Day Off is a classic that I can watch over and over again and still laugh at the uncanny wit. Let's not forget his performance in Family Business alongside Dustin Hoffman where he and his male familymembers robbed banks for a living. Election , The Lion King and Addicted to Love were all great performances by this modest actor.
