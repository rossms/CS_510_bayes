Kirk is the best of the best. He definitely shows all the talent and devotion he puts into the sport when he's on the floor. He has wonderful technique and gets the ball down the court. He also proves he is the best, because he is able to shoot from anywhere on the floor. I go to the same high school he did!Go West! And he influences everyone there.I've exchanged words with him many times! He is such a hottie too!! P.S. Next time I see him up there shootin hoops I'll tell him about this board.
