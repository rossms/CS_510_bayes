The only reason Brette even got a 2 is b/c he is a gunslinger.He is the most overrated sports figure in the world.He leads the league now (Dec 21, 2005) with INT's(24) and is a career high.What's bad is i like Farve alot but i want to set the record straight and say he was good but not great, I don't care how many MVP awards he has won he has thrown at least 1 INT almost every game.
