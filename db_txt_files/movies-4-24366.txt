Now when I read the books, there were 5 in the trillogy, I had already seen the TV show and it made some sense. If you have never read Douglas Adams or know nothing about the books, I can see why you would get a little lost. The fact that Mr Adams died before the movie went into production could be a cause for some concern but as a whole the movie holds fairly true to the books. So if you a fan you will at least like it, if not you might leave the theater thinking what just happened.
