To All: I am a beer lover and I've tried most of the beers in the RIA Top 50, and I've just recently discovered Abbot Ale (even though its from 1799!!!). This beer rocks! Its like Sam Adams only you can feel to 200+ year history in its taste. Go and look for this beer (where I live, Bennigan's offers it).
