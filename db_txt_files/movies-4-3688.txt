As a fan of the Destroyer books by Warren Murphy and Richard Sapir, I was a little disappointed when I first saw the movie. After a few veiwings, I got it. Not the best depiction it could have been, but a good introduction for the basic non-reading fan. A cop is all but killed and then trained by a non-existing federal agency as an assasin trained in an ancient martial art called Sinanju. Fred Ward plays Remo, and Joel Grey plays Chuin, the master that trains him. Kate Mulgrew has a decent turn as an army officer.
