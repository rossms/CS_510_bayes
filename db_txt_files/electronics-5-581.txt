Wow! I own a Sharp MD 722 (silver) and I absolutely love it. Solid bass, great price now (available for $189.95 after rebates). Front loading (I love that) and great looking. A little big compared to the latest portable recorders, but I love it. Heck, it's much smaller than portable CD players!! Crappy stock headphones though.
