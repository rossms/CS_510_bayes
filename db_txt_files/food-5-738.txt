I can think of nothing wrong with Corn Flakes other than the fact I add Splenda to make it sweet. Eaten plain, it's still not unpleasant. They stay crunchy in milk long enough to eat, and are mysteriously addictive, as some other people have mentioned. I think I could live off these - and they're reasonably priced since it's one of the simplest cereals out there.
