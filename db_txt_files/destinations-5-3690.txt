Why is KC ranked so low? Because there are no mountains? No beach? Not much of a downtown? OK, good points. But it's a great place to raise kids, there's not much traffic, it's cheap, the people are nice, and the bar-b-que is amazing (Gates is the best). I can see why it's not a top travel destination, but there's more to this city than you think.
