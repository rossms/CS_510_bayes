Horrormeister King and novelist O'Nan got together to keep a daily journal of the 2004 Red Sox season, from training camp until the final game of the World Series. It's particularly interesting, because their ongoing angst with the team comes through on every page, and its clear they have done little editing with the benefit of hindsight. Well written, and often funny, King's view of manager Francona are particularly pithy.
