The man Jesse Jackson has all my respect. I am a white 64 yr.old female. I would like very much to say to Jesse Jackson how I admire his dedication to the things that are right. He is the man that brought young men home from war prison. He has done so many good things and get not near enough credit. God bless you Jesse and keep on doing your good work. You are needed so much in this world of hate.
