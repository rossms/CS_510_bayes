THE MAN WAS A COMPLETE JOKE AS PRESIDENT. THE SOVIET UNION WOULD HAVE COLLAPSED ON ITS OWN, ANDWE WOULDN'T HAVE THE TREMENDOUS DEBT THAT HE LEFT US. HE ALSO LEGITIMIZED THE FAR RIGHT OF THE REPUBLICAN PARTY WHICH IN MY OPINION IS AS CLOSE TO FASCISM AS ANY PARTY AT ANY TIME IN THIS COUNTRY'S HISTORY. I WAS A REPUBLICAN MYSELF UNTIL THE FAR RIGHT FRINGE TOOK CONTROL.REAGAN LED THIS CHANGE IN THE PARTY, PROBABLY UNWITTINGLY AND WITHOUT ANY REGARD TO THE CONSEQUENCES.
