Being a Student Athletic Trainer for four years of High School, Four Years of College and eventually gaining my degree in Sports Medicine, I must say that it is the best tasting Sports Drink on the market. However let it be known that, a sport drink is meant to encourage your thirst, not quinch it. Water is the best source for you hydration needs. Sport Drinks are nice sources for electrolites, and cause you to want to drink more water and the players seem to like the flavors. As for tasting better, the need of hydration would be outweighed by the sugar content, if you added anymore.
