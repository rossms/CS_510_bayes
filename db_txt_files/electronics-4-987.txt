The Motorola StarTac is a good model, with a lightweight case, but it is not sturdy. The buttonpad is easy to use and straightforward. Though the above is true, the menu is hard to use, and is better suited for somebody with more time to fiddle around with specifics. Other than this setback, it is a good cell phone.
