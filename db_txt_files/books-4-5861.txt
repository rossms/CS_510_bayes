Every Dead Thing is quite graphic right out of the gate. The story si strong, as are the characters. The book should have no trouble keeping you interested. I assume this to be the first in a series of books featuring Bird, the featered detective. Connolly is an Irishman who definitely understands the genre. This is his debut, and it is very good, but the highly encouraging thing is that will only improve from here. There are an awful lot of sub-plots in Every Dead Thing. It probably could have benefited from better focus on the primary plots.
