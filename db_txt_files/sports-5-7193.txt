Michael Jordan is the greatest player of all time, from his amazing shot to his love for the game. I have the same love infact, inspired by this leader and champion. If not for him I would not have such a great passion for the sport. He made the impossible possible and every time I have watched him I have been entranced. I now realize his love for this great game and if one day I could meet him, I would forever be in debt.
