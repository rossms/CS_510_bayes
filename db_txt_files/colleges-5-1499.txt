Ignore the low ratings - they didn't attend UW or they were complete failures when they did (maybe they didn't like the fact that classroom courses took attendance - even on FRIDAY!). Only one of seven pass the CPA on the first try...UW was my ticket into that select 14 or 15%. Don't expect to come here JUST to party if you also expect to graduate!
