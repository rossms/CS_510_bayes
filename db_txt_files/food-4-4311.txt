I guess I should add to the debate between regular and Baked Lay's...I think that Baked Lay's are ten times better than the regular brand. It is a lot less greaser and the chips are more crunchier, which is something I like in my potato chips. Granted, Baked Lays aren't as good as Pringles, but they are healthier and the BBQ flavor is actually very good.
