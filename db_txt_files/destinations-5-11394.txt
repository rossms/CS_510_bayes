This National Park may be off the beaten track but it is well worth the detour. The excellent visitor centre with its helpful staff is a good starting point. Afterwards carry on to all the viewpoints, especially Painted Wall View. We visited on a snowy spring day and enjoyed the solitude and beauty of the area.
