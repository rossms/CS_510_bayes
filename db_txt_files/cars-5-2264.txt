The entire Z series were excellent automobiles. I prefer the first generation 240Z and the last generation 300zx (Z32). The early 240 broke ground in terms of being an affordable sports car with great styling and performance. The Z32 had a similar affect on consumers and the twin turbo model was a very serious contender to the Corvette and Porsches. Both the 240z and the z32 were ahead of their time in terms of style and execution. These were excellent cars in my opinion.
