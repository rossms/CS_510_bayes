A taut and memorable film, which for me is the most perfect expression of the American mythos: The Good, taking up arms against the Evil, in a world in which all either oppose the Good or are too cowardly to support: therefore the Good goes it alone, no matter what, and of course prevails. Black and white in this film never smudges into ugly and indistinct and oh-so-real gray, as it does in real life as perceived by more mature nations elsewhere on earth.
