What a great school. Not just saying that because I'm an alum but because it is true! Excellent faculty, amazing campus, beautiful town and as the others have said, the price is right. Did I mention the sports program, can anybody say Michael Jordan, how about Mia Hamm?!?!?! UNC is the total package - top notch education.
