Well done! Excellent realization of religion and religious mystery in the far future. The worlds showcased are believable and the characters well developed. I believed the reasons they were doing what they were doing. The shirke, still don't know what to make of this mysterious killing machine whose history would make an interesting novel in itself. Perhaps I'll read the sequels and see, but I rather like the mystery of this dark angel/demon.
