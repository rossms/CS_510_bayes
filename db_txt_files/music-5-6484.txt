This album clearly shows that Rage Against the Machine is the greatest rock band of the 90's. In a world of no more guitar solo's, Tom Morello kills on these tracks, establishing himself as the only guitar hero of the 90's. Zack's meaningful lyrics, they are the ultimate. To mix rock and roll with politics and not be boring is tough.
