You would think Hitchcock came from the grave and secretly took over Robert Zemeckis' (the director's) body. This is a clever thriller that is very chilling, and, even though not original, it's still brilliant stuff. A change of character for Harrison Ford alright. Worth seeing. Summary: A CLEVER, CHILLING THRILLER THAT'S WORTH SEEING.
