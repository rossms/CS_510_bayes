Metal Gear Solid 1 was the best game ever for the Playstation now MGS 2 is the greatest game on PS2 basically because of the outstanding graphics and its extremely realistic, i agree sometimes it can get annoying with the long clips but doesn't really matter as the clips are also good and make the game almost like a Hollywood movie! Great game cant wait for Metal Gear Snakeater where you play as Solid Snake for the whole game:D and have to eat animals to stay alive.Long live MGS!
