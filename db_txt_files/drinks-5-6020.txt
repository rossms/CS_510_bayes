Ale-8 is an understated kind of drink. It's got a smooth ginger ale flavor with a hint of fruit and vanilla and unlike most soft drinks, you're not thirsty again after you've had one. Like other ginger ales, it's also excellent when piping hot-- the ginger feels nice and tingly going down. It is by far my beverage of choice. I'm particularly annoyed by the fact that the reviewers who gave it a bad rating have either stated they've never heard of it or had nothing to say whatsoever.
