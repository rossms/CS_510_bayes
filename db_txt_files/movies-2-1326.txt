Tarentino's first flick. The critics and other artsy types got the vapors and ejaculated in their jeans over this mindless violence tripe. The plot is a gaggle of mopes planning a heist and then licking their wounds after the crime goes bad. It goes down hill from there. The nihilism that is so evident in Tarentio films really got its start here. Did you all enjoy the torture scene? Of course this type of film does have its adherents. Just don't tell us that it's art!
