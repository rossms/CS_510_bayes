I love it! I can get salad with many toppings, many different types of pizza, pasta and sauce, a drink and dessert for $5.00. Tastes better than frozen. The only bad thing- the air hockey games in their gameroom are rigged. I played at 2 different ones and the puck flew off the table each time- almost injuring little kids -so I stick to just eating now.
