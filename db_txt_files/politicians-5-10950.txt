I love Senator Hatch. He's a hard-ball playing devout conservative. He obviously gets the job done because he has been reelected numerous times. Smart man with a good education, good public speaker, as well as respectful and well spoken. You don't see much screwing around with this guy which is rare in today's political arena. Hatch tells it like it is.
