Rick Adelman is extremly underrated as a coach. Every single one of his players can step up and play any role. He lets his players have freedom and coach themselves. He needs to get serious recognition for Coach of the Year. Just because he has not won a championship does not mean he is not a great coach. And honestly, I want to become a basketball coach and want my style to be exactly like Adelman's. Keep up the good work Rick.
