Despite a slow start and a few holes in the plot, The Score is a pretty entertaining movie. It's about a seasoned thief who hooks up with a young accomplice to steal a scepter. There are some pretty exciting action scenes, and the plot has a few fun twists. Edward Norton (the young accomplice) is excellent, especially when he poses as a developmentally delayed person. Robert de Niro and Marlon Brando are very good in their roles, too. (I thought Marlon Brando was dead, but apparently that's not the case!) In my opinion, The Score is worth seeing on the big screen.
