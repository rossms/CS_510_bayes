I feel bad dissing my home team but, lets face it the Orioles are lousy. Four consecutive losing seasons, a foul first in the history of this once great franchise. Lawyers (Peter Angelos esq. owner) and MLB do not mix well! And that old codger Sid Thrift gives senior adults a bad name. The only reason the Orioles still draw crowds is because of the Sport Utility driving rich New Yorkers and Washingtonian corporate types and their yuppie puppies who come for the status and the excellent stadium Oriole Park at Camden yards. It's like the Emperor's New Clothes 2002 version!
