Maybe 4.5 stars, but not a 5. Pete was a prolific scorer, but not the greatest college player. Alcindor, Walton, David Thompson, maybe; but Pistol Pete never got his team the Final Four. Had he played for Dean Smith, he would probably been just a 20 PPG scorer. I will say that taken from an entire basketball career, Pete gets 5 Stars.
