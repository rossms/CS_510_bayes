Jackson is one of the greatest civil rights leader in the history of our nation. MLK and Malcolm X were more influential in the '60s, but he carries on the same civil disobedience and progressive programs as the two. His Rainbow Push Coalition is a fine organization and I am glad to see that the African American community is well-represented.
