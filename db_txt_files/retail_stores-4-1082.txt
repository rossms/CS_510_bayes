I bought my fave pair of trousers from this store last summer. Pink (to me there is no other color) with wide legs (so 70 s but anyway I like it, it goes well with boots and high heels. Not to say, some of those wide legged things should never have left the 70 s. Feeling, I have to end this paranthese. OK.) They look awsome on me. Not that there is clothes that doesn t but anyway. They really do. I like the ads too, using normal people was a great idea. Since there are mostly normal people buying the clothes. AND most people, believe it or not, are very normal.
