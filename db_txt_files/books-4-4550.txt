Seen the movie and read the book. I like that the movie stays quite close to the book. A nice book about friendship and tragic too. George has the difficult task of looking after Lenny a large man who is kind of on the slow side. Lenny is a good person but does not know his strength. they go from farm to farm and try to earn a living and have the dream of having a small farm of their own some day. Lenny gets himself into trouble near the end and george and Lenny must run away. has a sad ending.
