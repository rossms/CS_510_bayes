A great game for kids. Pokemon is just good old fashioned gaming fun. A nice adventure that is complex but simple to use and understand. My kids still needed help but now can usually play them all the way through with very little assistance. Due to the fact Red and Blue are identical in every important way this rating will apply to both.
