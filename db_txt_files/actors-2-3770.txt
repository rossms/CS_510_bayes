This man's only talent, and I mean his ONLY talent, is looking real cool while he's smoking. He smokes real tough, but so does Chow Yun Fat who can actually act. I suppose Bruce Willis is kind of charismatic, but he should never ever try to be funny, or witty, or able to deliver lines. A good role for him would be a guy who stands around and smokes. That would be so badass.
