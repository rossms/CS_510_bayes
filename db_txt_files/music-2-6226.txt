It is a sad state for the modern music industry, reflective both of what is currently being hyped and peoples bad taste, when you've never heard of most of the truly talented bands. This rap/rock craze has allowed this guy to go 8x platium. He doesn't get a one solely on the fact that he has great hair...that said, I miss Axl Rose (a true bad ass).
