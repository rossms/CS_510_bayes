disturbing. very scary. this movie just shows that 1970's and 1980's movie are better than the horror movies now adays. its a cult classic i love the scene when the girl enters the house after her boy friend went in there and did not come back for a while i was on the edge of my seat. and the ending is super disturbing. although not as popular as other horror movies at its time and that came later but this,the exorsist,halloween,and much more are great horror movies my favirote is halloween. i say see this movie in the dark alone i think you woul get the most scared there.
