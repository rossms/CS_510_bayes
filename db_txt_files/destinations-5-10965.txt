I really enjoyed this I think the main reason was we had a very large group therefore I could always go on a rollercoaster (which I love) with SOMEBODY and I got to have some free Michelob beer. It's really a beautiful park. My favorite rollercoaster was the wooden one. The only thing I didn't like was at the end of my day, the sky let loose with a lot of rain and was literally as high as my knee. Don't like being wet in regular clothes, but that wasn't the park's fault :)
