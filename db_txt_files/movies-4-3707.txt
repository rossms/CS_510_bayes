Never knew that Brad Pitt could be funny. He and Julia are a perfect match (sorry Jennifer) in this 4-star movie. But James Gandolfini steals the spotlight as a hit man who has a little secret that Julia uncovers with style and subtle humor. I would highly recommend this to Julia and Brad fans of all ages.
