Little more than little cakes of sugar but one of my favorites. I prefer the old school kind that came in the foil envelopes. There were assorted, grape and the king of all candy flavors, cherry. The long tubes aren't bad (both the blue and green ones are nice) but they don't have exactly the same texture as the old school kind.
