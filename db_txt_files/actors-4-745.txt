The main reason I like him is that after he died of AIDS, the light went on in Ronald Reagan's head. Thank you, Rock, for that! He did some good movies, too, and his acting skills were terrific. I'd like to see more of Hudson. Does anyone have any movies to recommend that feature him? Please send me a personal message if you do. Cause the only ones I've seen are Giant and Pillow talk. Anyway, I feel bad for anyone who dies of AIDS, so may Rock Hudson rest in peace where no Ronald Stupid Reagan can give him trouble. Take care, everyone!
