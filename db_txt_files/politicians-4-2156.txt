weatherdude, I'm sorry about your grandparents, but to characterize their cancer development and unfortunate deaths to something George W. Bush did while in office as Governor of Texas or as President of the United States gives a pass to 535 accomplices (on the federal level, alone!) and assumes a medical corrrectness to the whacko environmentalist lobby that even reknowned medical scientists and physicians are unwilling to subscribe to.
