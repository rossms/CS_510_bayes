The Yamaha Wolverine is one bad a** bike. It is the original sport utility atv. In my opinion the best atv made. The yamaha 350 is very powerful for its size it can tow a great load. It is also very fast I can smoke all my friends on mine. The best thing is its a yamaha, yamaha is known to last forever. My 1986 yamaha moto 4 which is riding on its 8th set of tires and i figure over 150,000 miles still starts up and runs with no problems.
