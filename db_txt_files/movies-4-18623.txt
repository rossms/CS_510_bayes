A little slow at times, but largely good. Kidman is solid, and the film is suspenseful at times. The film unfortunately suffers from an overly melancholy aura that makes the film boring at some points. Had the film been shorter and more fast-paced it would have ultimately been a solid five star rating, as it is well-written, well-directed and certainly well-acted.
