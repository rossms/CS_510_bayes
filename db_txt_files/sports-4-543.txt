Hall of Fame caliber my eye. He's a good looking shortstop for the New York Yankees. I wish people wouldn't confuse looks for talent. He's a solid player, but it's hard to get a real assessment of him given that he plays in New York, and I've come to find that New York makes players seem better. Jeter is the heart of that team though. He's trailing a few players as best shortstop of his generation. In fact, he's lost a step really. I don't think much would be said of him if he played in Milwaukee.
