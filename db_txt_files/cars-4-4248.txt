We have a 1999 Avant, and it has been TROUBLE-FREE at 60,000 miles. The routine maintenance is expensive, but this is not a Chevrolet. The car is really solid with no squeaks or rattles. Its foul-weather capability is tough to beat. We sometimes wish for more power, but have no trouble keeping up with traffic anywhere, especially passing. We would buy another!!
