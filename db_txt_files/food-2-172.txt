I enjoy honey and love oats but this mixture just isn't that good to me. Too crunchy for my tastes for a cereal and not very good at all when allowed to get soggy. I would prefer a regular bowl of oatmeal to this cereal. A biscuit with honey is also much better. I can see how many enjoy this but for me the mix of flavors was not very good.
