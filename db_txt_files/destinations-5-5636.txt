I hear some say here that Mass. has 'narrow minded people' or that any state that re elects Teddy Kennedy is 'bad'- perhaps Mass. is 'liberal' and those ideas are too much for narrow minded intolerant bigots to understand. I live in neighboring CT- and have found the Bay Sate to be wonderful and progressive- which is far more then many other states in the south and lower midwest. TO IHATE MASS take your ight wing hate and prejudice to the deep south- stock market down again- inflation rising- see what your silly mind and dumbness bring to you in the future- the right and the GOP are near dead.
