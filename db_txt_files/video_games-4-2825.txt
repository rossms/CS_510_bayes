As the inaugural reviewer of NCAA 2K2, I'll say it was a fine rookie effort well in line with the tradition of Sega Sports, but it could have been a bit better. I'm not disappointed or anything, and the gameplay is terrific, but couldn't they have gotten licenses for the other 3 BCS bowls? I don't know about anybody else, but playing in the Sega Sports bowl just doesn't get me as excited as the Fiesta bowl does. Anyway, I'm out like the last hoagie on Rick Majerus' plate.
