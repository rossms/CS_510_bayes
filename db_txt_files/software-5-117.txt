By far the most user-friendly and effective software that I have ever used. When April 14th came around, and I had still not started my taxes, I turned to the Turbo Tax Web site, and was able to quickly and easily prepare my taxes for $19.95. Complete with definitions, tips as to how to lower your taxes, and a completely intuitive user interface, my taxes have never been less stressful. Intuit's Turbo Tax software is truly an example of technology that makes my life easier - 5 stars all the way.
