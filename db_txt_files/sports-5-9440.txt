Speedy Clax rocks. He's already better than Tony and you know that that is a true statement by what my wise old friend nacho said at the top. The spurs dump kidd because he's old and isn't really all that great keep parker and speedy and give speedy the top spot. Ashleigh you are cool (even though you like LSU). HAHA
