Reconciling my checkbook used to take hours (I am obviously challenged by basic math!!), but now I can rest assured that my balances are correct because of this software. And it helps me with financial planning because I can get a picture of exactly where my money goes each month. Very user-friendly, as well. I have not had occasion to use the tech support, so I have no input there.
