These type of games are just lame as hell. running around killing a zombie every 3 hours and spending those hours tryin desperately to find keys , seeming to be the most popular puzzle item, is crap. It is interesting though in a way how it shapes it to be in a structure of a horror movie, but thats the thing about it..
