I think that this was a beautiful song... even for people who do not like this kind of music. The music itself... along with the lyrics are awesome. And the video completed the song 100% It was emotional, touching, just a beautiful song. I like a lot of g r, so i can't put it above a few others.. but i will say it's one of my favorites! Slash did kick ass guitar solo as always!
