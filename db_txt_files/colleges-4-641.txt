GULC is making the right moves to move up into the top tier of law schools. Rapidly improving physical site with recent addition to the main building and purchase of a key parcel of land; founding of new Institute for Study of the Supreme Court (more profs at G-town have argued cases before the Court than at any other school); significantly fewer students entering this fall (about 100 fewer, I believe), driving student-to-teacher ratios down and creating a better learning environment. Clinical education is already the best in the country.
