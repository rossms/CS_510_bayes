Alan Rickman is charming, indeed, but his various attempts at an American accent can be downright hysterical (ex.: Judas Kiss -perhaps he was absent that day at English drama school). Though his choice of roles is at times questionable ( Dogma, Mesmer, Judas Kiss, to name a few) and his acting, inconsistent, his talent and personage rival most popular American actors his age. His versatility shines most brightly in films such as Sense and Sensibility, Die Hard, and Galaxy Quest.
