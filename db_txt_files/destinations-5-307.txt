Brisbane is a bit like a smaller Sydney, but without the hype or high costs! Its clean, safe, easy to get around in and is a very modern and progressive city that is thriving in every sense. The weather can be uncomfortably hot and humid if youre not used to a sub-tropical climate, but still makes for lots of great times spent soaking up the sunshine outdoors.
