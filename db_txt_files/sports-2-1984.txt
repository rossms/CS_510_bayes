I personally hate the yankees. Being one of the richest teams in baseball combined with being one of the oldest teams destroys the game of baseball. There is no denying the players have extreme talent. If my favorite team the METS were in the yankees position im surei wouldnt have this opinion but theyre not. I also just dislike the yankees as people. Derek jeter is a sellout. The only one i dont have something bad to say about is Pedditt. A good pitcher. i just hope 27 doesnt come anytime soon.
