Ah how the mighty have fallen. My mom used to take me here atleast twice a week while she shopped. I always loved looking at all the toys, and after she was finished shopping she would take me to the cafe to buy me an Icee. Their prices were really good too, and their products were much better than Wal-Mart's. I hope they make a comeback, but it's not looking good. But 5 Stars just for the good memories.
