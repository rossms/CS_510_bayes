Eclipse are generally excellent. Its a shame not so many people know about them. While the cigarette itself is just good,the advantages of smoking these are really why its excellent. There is little second hand smoke, it dosen't smell, and it may reduce some of the health risks of smoking. Give it a couple packs, its worth a shot. The only disadvantage is that its a pain in the a** to light and after a while they just don't cut it, you need something that you can really taste.
