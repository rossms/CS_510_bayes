He is truly a great man and it shows. I feel Rix is playing on his kindness and clouding Bobby's judgement; therefore, the program suffers. Someone should make Bobby aware how selfish and immature Rix is because there are some very good TEAM players that are playing their hearts out in vain. We can still save the season!
