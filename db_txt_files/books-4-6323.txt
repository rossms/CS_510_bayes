Although I don't watch Fox News avidly, nor his television program, I read his book in tandem with Stupid White Men by Michael Moore, just to be fair and balanced. Surprisingly, I enjoyed the Factor very much, felt at home with his message, and found it to be practically identical with that contained in Moore's book. It's also the same conclusion I reach in Gossip Kills.
