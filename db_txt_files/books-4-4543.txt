This is one of my favorite books. It is written in an almost matter of fact manner. However, Dumas also does a wonderful job of painting an air of mystery around Edmond, the main character. This book has all the necessary sensational elements of a Hollywood movie and those alone (violence, sex, mystery, revenge, romance...) do well to keep the reader involved. But most satisfying to me is all the conflict is resolved by the end which is not always the case with some literature.
