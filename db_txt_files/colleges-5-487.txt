I know three respectable Ateneo MBA grads: former Phil. Pres. Economic Leader Fidel Ramos, AIM Dean Nieves Confesor and De La Salle Dean Echauz. And I know its direct partner institution in the US, the prestigious Regis University of Colorado. Ateneo MBAs are smart leaders who deliver well, demonstrating pure and genuine performance MINUS the attitude of arrogance which might be sensed from graduates of other schools.
