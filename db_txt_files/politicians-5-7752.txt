George Washington was the perfect first President of the United States. He was a wonderful leader to both his men and to his country. He was also a Christian with a strong faith in God. I read recently that as an aide to Gen. Edward Braddock, he escaped injury although four bullets ripped his coat and two horses were shot from under him.
