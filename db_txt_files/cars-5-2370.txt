Well in my oppinoin The Viper in any form gts, rt/10, or vemon is a great vehicle. now i come from a family that would rather buy an importend car from a junk yard rather than buy an american made car. But the minute i saw the viper i feel in love with it. The looks as well as the power is just astonishing. and to all the people who say that the viper is crap and that a celica or supera can beat or is better must of been high when they wrote this. because the viper venom 650rs would smoke there asses let alone a venom 800tt.
