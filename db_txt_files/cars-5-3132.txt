I bought one of these last year. the only problem with it is the acceleration is not so great, however when you DO hit 115 it feels like the car is sitting still. So it gets a 5 for it's handling. Hey, what's with this P.O.N.T.I.A.C. garbage? why don't you just spell the whole thing out for us - you racist hill-billy. And then you're scared to show an EMail address? COWARD!
