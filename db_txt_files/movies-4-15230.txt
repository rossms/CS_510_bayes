A very good movie which refreshes the story of Cinderella. Wonderful acting by Drew Barrymore as Danielle/Cinderella and by Anjelica Housten as the Step-mother. This movie, especially the acting is closer to fantasy than reality, yet isn't that the way it's meant to be? This movie is suitable for young children, yet can also be enjoyed by all ages.
