Some Albertsons can be OK, but the one by my house is horrible. First off, the outside is painted a disgusting salmon color. Not necessarily an indicator of the inside, but I must say... IT IS! As soon as you walk in, the smell of not-so-fresh seafood hits you like a ton of bricks. Kind of odd considering the seafood is located at the BACK of the store. The lighting is low and dismal and the prices are nothing to write home about.
