Outstanding Person, Excellent Coach, Perfect Mentor, Thoughtful Man. What more could OSU basketball and OSU wish for? Sutton was kind enough to call my house and talk to my husband after my husband wrote a heartfelt story about his love of OSU basketball that was passed on to Eddie somehow. He called our house just to thank my husband...how much better of a man can you get?!!!!!! 5 Stars for Coach!
