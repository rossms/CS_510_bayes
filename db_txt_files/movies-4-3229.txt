An aptly named psychological thriller that features unbelievable performances from Nicole Kidman and Alec Baldwin. This movie also features one of the all time great movie rants - Alec Baldwin's hotshot surgeon character explains that he's not playing God - he IS God. According to Baldwin's character, when people pray to be saved, it's him that they're praying to - not the Big Guy upstairs. Malice is definitely worth checking out - if only for the sinister performances of the movie's lead characters.
