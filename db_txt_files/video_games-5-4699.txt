I remember pounding the crap out of run buttons on this game in the 50 yard dash. Great game, but it was hard to find to find a machine that worked properly - mostly because in order to run - I mean really fly - you had to beat the life out of the buttons. I seem to remember that my favorite game was the javelin throw.
