Camel cigarettes have been there with me since i was 15 years old. first the filters, then the unfiltered but never to the lights, and no other brand can substitute. Camel cigarettes are the best for your buck. strong and heavy, but with an almost amazing flavor. 250,000,000 cigarettes im still surprised by the taste.
