This song is pretty good, though it's not the best song on the album. Judging from this song and video, I thought this band had no substance or relevance. But I listyened to the album and I found the songs to be new, inventive and great to listen to for those needing relax from their day. The video could use some work...but hey, all those boy/girl band's videos are the same too!
