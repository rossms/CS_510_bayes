This has been my favorite car for almost a year now scince I found it. I have a paion for 911's and this being the fastest and most performece 911 porsche has ever desinged for the road, of course I love it! If you match it up to other top exotic supercars it would put up a nasty very formidible fight (with the right guy or gal behind the wheel. As I've heard its hard to drive but I'm sure once you get used to it, it would be the best ride of your life! If I had 230 grand it would be the first thing I would buy.
