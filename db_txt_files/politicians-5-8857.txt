The 1990s saw the greatest prosperity of any decade in the history of the US. I used to think that Clinton was in the right place at the right time and managed not to screw it up. But after hearing about what he did compared to the recent revelations about the Bush administration, I have developed a new respect for his administration. Generations from now, history books will report that the country went from one of the best presidents to the worst in 2000.
