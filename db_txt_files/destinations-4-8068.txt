This is probably my favorite zoo, and one is that is most appreciated of any zoo in America. Why? For what it offers to adults, kids, and especially families, it is a bargain. It only cost my wife and I two dollars each, our oldest kids a $1 and our youngest children got in free. I still remember when the Houston Zoo was free, and that wasn't too long ago. The San Antonio Zoo, probably the best zoo in Texas, costs $12 a head. The Dallas Zoo, I believe, is $7 per person. No, Houston's Zoo is not the best, but what a bargain for a great day of family fun!
