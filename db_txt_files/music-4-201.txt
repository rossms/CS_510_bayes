REM's history can be condensed to pre Out of Time, and post Out of Time. This album marked the transition of REM from the best college band that never made it mainstream, to one of the most influential bands of its generation. While this album is very, very good, it doesn't quite measure up with Life's Rich Pageant, Reckoning, or the timeless Murmur. I wonder if they had to do it all over again if they would put this one out...
