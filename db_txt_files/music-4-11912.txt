This album is good because it contains a variety of songs, meaning that the tempo, melody, and lyrics vary quite a bit from song to song. Also, there are two songs on this album that are similar (and flashy) to songs that TLC has made hits of in the past. They are Scrubs and Silly Ho. These songs appeal strongly to the teenage/young adult pop, r b, and hip-hop crowd, and especially to women (because of their female empowering lyrics). Unpretty, another smash hit, has a positive message that many teens/young adults can relate to.
