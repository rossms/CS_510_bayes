I loved the way Good Night and Good Luck was filmed - all that back lighting and so much picturesque cigarette smoke that I thought I was going to start coughing. I do remember those regrettable McCarthy era days, as well as Edward R. Morrow, vaguely, as someone my parents watched, but the movie rings almost too true for today and is worth note. We have to be vigilant, folks, if we want to prevent a repeat perfomance of what happened then. Lets guard our liberties!
