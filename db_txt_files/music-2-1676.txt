I'm not an avid U2 fan but I do enjoy their earlier songs like Mysterious Ways and With or Without You . When I saw the music video for Beautiful Day , I decided to give U2 a chance and I purchased the disc All That You Can't Leave Behind . Needless to say, I was somewhat disappointed. As it turns out, Beautiful Day is the only good song on the album but for $20 I don't feel it was worth the price. If you're a big U2 fan then you might enjoy the album. Otherwise, take a pass on this CD. It won't win any new fans.
