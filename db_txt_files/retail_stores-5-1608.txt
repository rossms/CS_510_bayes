I think Sears is a wonderful store. My reasons are there low prices,good quality, friendly and helpful service,and all the name brand items found throughout the store. Where else can you buy a refrigerator,T.V, clothes,a bed,tools,and a washer and dryer under the same roof.With quality name brands attach to them.
