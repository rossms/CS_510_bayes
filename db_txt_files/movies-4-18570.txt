For an old horror movie, Poltergeist is still a good movie to watch to this day. Most of the effects and action are so realistic that it makes your mind go crazy. That's the best part of the movie, that you think that it could happen to you and that's what makes it worth watching over and over again. Some of the background music wasn't all that good, but everything else I wouldn't change.
