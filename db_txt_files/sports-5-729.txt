You're all fooling yourselves. Every one knows Griffey is one of the best all around players ever. He's like Willy Mays but better. His effortless swing is the most fluid of all time. And as for talk of him being a crybaby, I'd like to see how you react when you tear your hamstring you bunch of pussies. You guys are all talk. Griffey is the man.
