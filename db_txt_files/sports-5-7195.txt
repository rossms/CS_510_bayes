Perhaps I need only say that the NBA is simply not the same without Michael Jordan. I would watch the Bulls just to watch Jordan no matter whom they played. Today, I don't watch the Lakers, Trailblazers or Spurs unless they are playing against another good team. The only exception is the Kings, a team I enjoy to watch all the time. But there is no single player that brings me to the tube nowadays.
