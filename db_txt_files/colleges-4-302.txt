In reponse to fgfgd' s comments, it is really you who should do your home work. The comments given by others here concern Heriot Watt's standing as an internatioanl business school, not it place in the Scottish university system. I work for IBM and they are paying for my MBA there. So are firms like Exxon, Transamerica, Du Pont etc. In addition, of the other schools mentioned only 3 have almost any entrance requirents for admission. This is a well known aspect of Scottish universities.
