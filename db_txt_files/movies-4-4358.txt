Shrek is one of the only cartoons that revolve around something that isn't real, yet it still teaches you something you'll remember forever. It is true, that there are no green monsters walking around (or...atleast I haven't seen any), but it is true, however, that some people have an inferiority problem, and this is what makes this movie so satisfying to watch.
