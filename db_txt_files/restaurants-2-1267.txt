while the food at the Raby's on William Cannon in Austin is fine, the restroom smell would make you lose your lunch. With no paper towels, stench in general and obvious no cleaning of a filthy restroom this to me says much about the general sanitary condition of any restaurant. I won't go back only because with no soap or towels in the restrooms plus filthy restrooms means the employees can not possibly be handling the food in a sanitary manner.
