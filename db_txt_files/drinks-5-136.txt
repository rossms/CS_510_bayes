Definetly one of my favorite beers. I'm from Philly and it is the standard beer that people get; say, Lager and the bartender knows exactly what you want. Its amber coloring and smooth taste make it perfect for anytime of the year. Come to Philadelphia and check out the brewery in Pottstown; it also provides the opportunity to try any of the other local brews that you can only get in the city, but are really good. One of the best beers from one of the best beer making towns in the country.
