Christy needs a top-flight agent to get her out of the Disney trap (which means bad TV-movies, two mediocre albums, a nasty relationship break-up, and eventual employment at Old Navy). Turn up her mike and find her better songs, and she could easily go in that direction. Super sexy, but could stand to put on about 15 pounds (hint: leg presses). WAY more potential than Duff or that no-account Lohan.
