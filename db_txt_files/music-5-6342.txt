Firstly, this wasnt the debut album - Hybrid Theory EP woz! Secondly this is one of the best albums ecer released and if you listen to the songs chester rarely screams. And he has an absolutely amazing voice and his potential is realised in Meteora. This is a must-listen-to if u like nu-metal and like rap-metal. This is a great blend of the 2. Wonderful stuff.
