In addition to being a fantastic University for European MBAs, this is a great institution for Americans who either require a few pre-req type of credits (Finance, Economics, Law, etc.) or who simply want to study overseas to broaden their horizons. Classes are generally in English (thereby, those credits are transferrable to a US institution); classes are also VERY CHEAP on US standards, and economic housing/food is available. Finally, in Rotterdam, you are just a hop,skip,and jump from the following awesome cities: Paris, Amsterdam, Brugge, Brussels, Cologne, London, etc.
