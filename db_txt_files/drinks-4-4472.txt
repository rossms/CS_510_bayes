Wonderful dram. As far as I'm concerned this one is right up there with the MacAllan. This one also tends to be casked in sherry butts, but it's got a personnality all its own. Nose is fruity (Oranges?) and sweet, oily and smoky. Taste is sherried with some wood. Finish is rather long with plenty of warmth.
