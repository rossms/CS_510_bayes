aptly named. i felt like i was sitting in hell while i was watching it. some friends thought it would be good to go on halloween to see it, and maybe it was supposed to be scary.....but i guess it didn't come across that way to me. the acting was decent, and the tone was definitely well set....but that's about all that i can find good to say about the movie. it felt drawn out and slow to progress, and i found myself wishing that it would end so that i could go eat
