Out of all the delivery-only pizza places, this is my favorite. Pretty decent quality food, I love their garlic/butter sauce that comes with each pizza, and fairly priced. The pizza is considerably less greasy than most of their competitors as well. You can also order the pizza online in some areas, too.
