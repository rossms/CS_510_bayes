I used to drink Busch all the time, but when I tried Miller Lite, I kissed that mule urine good bye. Smooth, Light, Crisp. no aftertaste. I managed to get a teeny buzz after drinking 3 of them. If you are not much of a drinker and don't like to get drunk, this is the beer for you. Miller is the Champagne of beers. you can't get any better than that.
