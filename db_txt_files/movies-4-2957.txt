If you are expecting anything near the caliber of Silence of the Lambs, you aren't going to get it with this one. I'm not squeamish in the least, but they really went overboard on the gross out stuff. Also, out of his cell, Anthony Hopkins is not nearly as scary and imposing, and although Julianne Moore is a great actress, seeing someone else playing Clarice Starling just doesn't work. I did enjoy the movie, but it's more bubblegum than a real thriller.
