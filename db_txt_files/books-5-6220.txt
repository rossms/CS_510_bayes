This is a short, intense, true story of an enigmatic student at Emory University who decided to cast off traditional society, rid himself of money and possessions, and travel to Alaska, where he planned to live in the wilderness for a summer. It's written by the author of Into Thin Air, and it has the same clear, compelling style. As different as this Emory student was, it's hard not to sympathize with him as you watch his journey through the eyes of the people he met along the way, who invariably felt drawn in by this kid's charisma and uncompromising ideas.
