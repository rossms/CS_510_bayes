These are my absolute favorite cookies that I usually buy every time I go to the store. I don't know. Maybe it's their simplicity which attracts me most- Chips Ahoy! is just a classic, good ol' fashioned chocolate chip cookie. Nothing more, nothing less. Every once and a while, I'll crave an Oreo, but for the most part, this is my numero uno cookie.
