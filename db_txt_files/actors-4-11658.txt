I would really give her a 4.5. Renee is showing to be a great actress. I have seen her in many roles and she is good in all of them. I think the first one was Jerry MaGuire,as the girl who ended up being his wife. I liked her in Bridget Joneses diary. And one True thing with Meryl Streep. I thought she did a great job as Roxie in Chicago. In the last few years she has proven herself as a good actress. Update: I am looking forward to watching Cinderella Man this summer. AND congratulations to her on her wedding to Kenny Chesney. she seems like a nice lady...I wish them the best.!!
