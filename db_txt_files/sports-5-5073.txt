Are you f$#%ing kidding me. This is some kind of a joke. How is David Thompson not in the top 3. People re-read the criteria this is for greatest men's COLLEGE basketball player. Michael Jordan was a good college basketball player. But even placing him in the top 5 UNC players of all time is not a given. Tim Duncan was again a good college player but give me a freakin break. I cannot even continue with this ranting because this poll is so out of whack.
