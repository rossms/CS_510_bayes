I rarely watch sports on TV and have never watched the NBA playoffs before this last season. I can really say that Allen Iverson got me hooked on basketball. Watching Iverson on the court was really engaging, he has the style and the attitude not to mention being a great basketball player. It seems like it would be much easier to kick butt if you are a giant but Iverson relies on skill, speed and strategy to get the job done. Some of the shots he made in the playoffs took my breath away. You can really see the love of the game in Iverson and he has inspired a love of the game in me as well.
