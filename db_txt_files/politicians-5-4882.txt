My political feelings aside, there is probably no Republican more equipped to be Secretary of Defense than Donald Rumsfeld. His response to the September 11th attacks was very quick and decisiveness, and he has continued to play a vital role in the War on Terror. He has been involved in politics and defense for decades, even serving as President Ford's Secretary of Defense from 1975 to 1977. Again, my political feelings notwithstanding, this guy is definately an adequete Secretary of Defense.
