i love your candy bar, it's my choice 9 times out of 10. the only thing i'm a little disgusted at it the commercial airing at this time. the ad with the guy making the noises while waiting for a massage. i think it's the worst commercial there is, i change the channel everytime it comes on, which is alot. please make a better commercial. thanks for listening
