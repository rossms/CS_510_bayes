Where to begin with Dirk Nowitzki? A 7'0 German, who can dribble better than point guards, play in the paint better than any centre, and hit any jumper better than all the guards in the league. He is the God amung Basektball players... we all need to give respect to the greatest player Ever! Dirk will one day lead the Mavs to the title baby!
