I dthink all those people who gave wal_mart bad ratings need to have their heads examined. I work for Wal-mart and they are great!!! You get good decent pay and benefits. Even part time employees get benefits such as medical insurance. Sometimes, there are problems at Wal-mart, such as too few cashiers, rude employees, and things out of stock but that happens at all stores so LEAVE WAL-MART ALONE!!!
