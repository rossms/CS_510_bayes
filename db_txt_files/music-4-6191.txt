This was Limp Bizkit's first and last really good cd. Every song blazes with emotion and energy. This cd is one of my favourites and made me a fan of Limp Bizkit before they started to suck. From the opening song pollution to the awesome counterfeit to the neat cover of faith , this cd rocks, it's a shame that can't be said for their other two albums.
