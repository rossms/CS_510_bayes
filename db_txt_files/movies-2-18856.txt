An absolutely cheesy movie. It had the potential to be a very interesting horror movie except for two things, the mechanical werewolf and the fact that we don't see the wolf until almost at the end of the movie. The wolf was so completely robotic in it's movements that I laughed throughout the rest of the movie after I saw the wolf. Up until the showing of the wolf, I was pretty much asleep during the rest of the movie.
