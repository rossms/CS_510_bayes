If you want to be an engineer, then it is the best Ivy league school for you if you ask me, plus, it is in upstate new york, it is very beautiful for most of the year and the people are really nice. Go to harvard if you want ot be a lawyer that destroys the economy by helping sue happy people. But if you want to design buildings and bridges that will help people with their daily lives, go to cornell and be an engineer!
