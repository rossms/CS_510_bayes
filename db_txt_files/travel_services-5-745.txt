Great car rental company. Fox in Los Angelers gave a great price on a Civic Hybrid for a 2-day rental. The next day, I needed a second car, phoned Fox at about 7:00 AM from my hotel, at 7:45 AM I was off with my second car for which they also gave a great price for a 1-day rental. I can only praise the drivers for the newer vans that take you back to the airport.
