Hard to believe he once featured in the monumentally crap Aussie soap 'Neighbours'. Has come along way and has show a good deal of versatility: drag queen in 'Priscilla Queen of the desert', by-the-book cop in 'LA Confidential' and amnesiac killer in 'Memento'. A far better actor than most of the current big names.
