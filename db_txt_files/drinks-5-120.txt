I hate beer generally speaking, but took a drink of my husband's stein of Yuengling Lager at Carrabba's Italian Grill the other night and what a wonderful flavor. Full bodied and no nasty bitter afterbite. I immediately went to the internet to find out if we can buy it over the counter in Alabama and wonder of wonders, we can get it at Walmart Supercenters and Bruno's. I'm ready to order a pony keg for a standby supply. Great stuff.
