My problem with Round Table is that they don't listen to what you want. I asked for artichoke hearts and they gave us anchovies. Yeah those are real similar, ones a fish and ones a vegetable. One time I ordered a pizza and they put the wrong ingredients on it again (imagine that) when we got there, about 5 people had their bare hands in our pizza picking off the ingredients that shouldn't be on there. Boy was that appetizing. All I can really say about Round table is that for the price you pay and the lousy service there are far better pizza chains out there. I know I wont be back.
