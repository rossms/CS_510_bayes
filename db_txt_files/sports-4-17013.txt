Lived in Jacksonville when the team was founded and began playing. The town was STARVING for football and really came alive when the team began playing. The crazy twist is/was - These guys are PRETTY DANG GOOD! They are coached by one of the greatest coaches I have ever seen. In a sea of professional millionare cry-babys, this team harkens back to the days when players had to behave themselves, get thier hair cut and show up ready to win.
