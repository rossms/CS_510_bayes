Let's just say Dennis Quaid will not be up for an Academy Award for this performance.As for Tyrese,he had better stick to his day job,he is a lousy actor.The acting in this movie was almost painful at times.The script was absolutely pathetic.I would not have watched the whole thing,but I paid 4.00 on PPV.
