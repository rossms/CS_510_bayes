DS is a really great game. It has excellent graphics and animation along with music and sound effects that make you feel like you are there. Plus the most excellent part is that you can download the programming window and create and add your own maps and towns, and other great stuff. They also have a lot of great chat rooms/groups and a bunch of other features for the game. Check it out if you like sci-fi and mythological type games. Myst Trilogy, Final Fantasy, etc., gamers will love this game as well.
