good movie. It is nice to see a romantic comedy where the two leads are over 50. Very well played by Diane Keaton and Jack Nicholson. Diane Keaton in particular was very good as the playwrite mom who has written off romance for herself. she has a grown daughter who originally is dating the man who she starts to take an interest in. Pretty predictable how this ends but an enjoyable movie to watch.
