Equivalent to the Samoa in the Girl Scout World, the Rolls Royce Silver Seraph of the Automobile Industry, the Cashmere of the Fashion World. I worship the Snickers Bar. It has everything you could every want, the touch of nougat, the subtle stream of caramel, the crunch of the peanuts and that rich chocolate coating. There's NOTHING better.
