A wonderfully crafted book containing brilliant images of a wild and magical world. The backgound is set when the turbulent struggle between the two nations begins. The tragic lead character - a young apprentice named Vilmos - is courageous and determined - attributes he needs in abundance as his world and his life is transformed. Vilmos's determination is remarkable, and his suffering almost unbearable - at times you feel that you must step in to help - then you remember it is just a book!
