I have to say that I am pleased with Kays even though I did have to call customer service to get my situation taken care of properly. I lost my center diamond out of my wedding ring (which was an upgraded ring) and when it was replace there was a huge carbon flaw in the center. After calling customer service and letting them know how upset I was and that I felt cheated out of the upgrade (do to other flaws when purchased), they gave me a brand new ring in the exact style, with a better quality diamond.
