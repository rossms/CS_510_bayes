Billy Sims was an incredible football player! Power,speed, and moves made him a serious threat. He had over 7,000 yards rushing in high school. Injury was the only thing that kept him from being listed as an all-time great in the NFL. Truly an all-time great in college and high school. Trent Pugh New Jersey
