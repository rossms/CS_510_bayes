I just spent two days in Phoenix, and I really enjoyed it. The scenery was stunning, and the weather was extremely pleasant, even in upper-80s heat (I guess that's nothing compared to the temperatures in the summer!). The sunsets were absolutely spectacular. If you're a golfer, you'd probably go nuts in Phoenix. Avid golfers were raving about the courses, saying they were the best they'd ever played. I'd definitely go back to Phoenix, especially in the dead of winter!
