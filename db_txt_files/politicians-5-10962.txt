He's a good senator and a gracious man. I sat in back of him on a airplane once in the late 1980's (he was still a Democrat). He was sitting in COACH class and was very gracious to the flight attendant and all around him. I was impressed by his demeanor. Compare this to Ted Kennedy being drunk on planes shouting ESKIMO POWER!! ESKIMO POWER!!
