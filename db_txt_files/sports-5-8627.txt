Kobe bryant obviously is the best player in the nba. I'm pretty sure everyone saw the game against philadelphia, in which Iverson didn't figure a way out how to get any points on kobe, but that's not really a big deal considering kobe is the best player in the league. Some people say that kobe shoots to much but I think michael jordan shot even more that he does, so for all of the haters out there just look at the dollar signs and the bling bling on my home town teams championship ring. For you kobe much love and keep tapping that booty around the nbal.
