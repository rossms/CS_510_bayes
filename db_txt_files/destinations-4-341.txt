Cold and misty and bereft of an economy as it may be, I have a soft spot for Newfoundland. It has a rugged and defiant charm that is very easy to fall for. The people are as rugged as their home, with a sense of humour and carrying on unmatched anywhere in Canada, and perhaps in North America. It's no accident that the province has produced a disproportional ratio of Canada's comics, musicians, actors and other entertainers, not to mention some of the strangest politicians ever to walk the earth.
