I have (briefly) enjoyed my coffee from Gevalia. I believe that is important for future purveyors realize that I personally am experiencing difficulty with ceasing automatic debit from my bank account by Gevalia. I requested that they stop sending me coffee after three orders - but they continue to debit my account and have ignored my letters! BUYERS BEWARE!!!!
