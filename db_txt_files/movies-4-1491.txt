people always say that this edition of the trilogy is the worst. but despite the grossness of it, i can't really rate it below the others. they're all kinda equal in my eyes cause they all have their own redeeming qualities. the exotic eastern settings and the supporting characters (the girl and the kid) were well done. out of the three movies, the girl in this one was my favorite cause she was funny enough to like.
