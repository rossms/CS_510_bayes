Surely there are others out there who, like me, still have these old 60 s commercials emblazoned into their psyche Sometimes you feel like a nut, sometimes you don t. Almond Joy s got nuts, Mounds don t. Effective ad not only because I ve remembered it all these years, but also it s how I remembered which of the two had the nuts (okay, the word almond should have tipped me off - but when I first heard the commercial I was too young to even know what an almond was.) BTW: both are equally as good - especially if you like coconut.
