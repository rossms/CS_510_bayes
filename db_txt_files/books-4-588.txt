This is the first of a series of Little House In the Big Woods set, and it basically is the almost true story of Laura Ingalls Wilder's family, narrated by herself. It provides a little historical knowledge of the time when families were migrating west. It has a more personal touch than school books by providing stories of daily life. While being informative, it is also pretty amusing in a simple way. The only problem I would have with it is the few, somewhat racist view of Native Americans.
