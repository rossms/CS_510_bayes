The Texans are bad compared to other teams, but don't forget that they are an expansion team. Give them time to work out what they need to do with the team, and they will someday be just as good as any other team in the league! Oh yeah, give a couple in-yo-face laughs at the guys who predicted 1-15 and 0-16. I'm not a big texan fan, but I wish them good luck with the new franchise.
