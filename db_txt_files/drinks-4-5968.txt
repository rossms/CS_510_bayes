As far as diet sodas go, this is the best tasting I've had (so far). It actually tastes like original Dr. Pepper somewhat, although the flavor is partially masked by the famous Aspartame aftertaste. If you can ignore the slight chemical taste due to the sweetener, it's still a pretty good tasting (diet) soda. I'd choose Diet Dr. Pepper over diet pepsi or diet coke anyday if I want a 0 carb soda. Or I'd have a Fresca, which is pretty good, too.
