I've read this book no less than four times, though not since the early eighties. It's about a girl who gets left alone on an island when her family is carried away on a boat and she accidentally gets left behind. She makes friends with a wild dog that she nurses back to health and makes a life for herself, hoping all the while that the ship will return and take her to her family. It's an extremely good book and I would recommend it to kids as well as adults.
