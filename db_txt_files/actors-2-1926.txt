He sucked on 21 Jump Street, was good in Edward... Donnie Brasco and Gilbert Grape, but was totally lame in Chocolat, Sleepy Hollow, Cry-Baby, and that Beat Generation semi-documentary. Very uneven in his performances and his judgment in selecting roles is questionable. He is also a greasy, diseased-looking little runt, which doesn't help.
