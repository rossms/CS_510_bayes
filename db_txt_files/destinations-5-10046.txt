Incredible smoke, probably the best I've ever had. These cigarettes come in a scarlet/maroon tin box, with a gold foil covering on the inside. The presentation itself is outstanding. Inhaling you can already taste the subtle vanilla and cream undertones. After the inhale, you can smell the cream and rich Turkish blends. On the exhale, make sure to pass the smoke thoroughly over your tongue, to get the best of this smoke. It is on the exhale you will get the best of the cream taste. Just an incredible cigarette- both original and high quality.
