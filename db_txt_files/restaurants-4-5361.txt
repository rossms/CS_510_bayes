I have good memories of Friendly's from my youth, and a recent experience in Albany, NY, affirmed my good feelings. Had a real good burger and then scarfed down a Jim Dandy sundae -- wow, is that great! The only problem was the very long wait for the check at the end (and I don't think that's an isolated incident, even back in the day the Friendly's staff weren't the most motivated characters...).
