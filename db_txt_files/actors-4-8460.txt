I think that Doris Day is a better actress than she has been given the chance to be. She always seemed to be in those light hearted movies where she was the virginal gal, who got the guy in the end. She has been in a couple dramas that showed she has some real acting ability such as Love Me Or Leave Me with James Cagney.It really seems unfair that she did not have a chance to have more heavyweight dramas that could show her acting ability. She also has a great singing voice.
