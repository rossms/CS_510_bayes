Just goes to show what happens when the marketing virus invades the ice cream world. The ice cream itself isn't good - it's really gummy. The mix-in selection is great (their only plus) but sometimes they skimp on them. It's pricy, and you're basically paying for the privilege of watching them make it. Lines are long and stores can be a real mess. I'm normally a fan of chunky ice cream, so if they can't win me over, they've got problems.
