I love this game It is one of those games you could stay up all night playing. It so far I have all of the expansion packs. In this game you can create a family and buy an existing house and just decorate it for them or you can build a house from scratch and decorate it for them Also you can control their lives and tell them what to do. Thefun thing is you can have sims interact with other sims in your area. If you like strategy/role playing games I would recommend this to you.
