I've seen Mel Gibson walk through plenty of films. Sometimes he does it well(think Maverick and Payback) but other times it's the results are horrible(Air America). This movie kind of falls in between. Mel does his best mugging in this and i'm sure once the sensitive thoughtful man bit began, feet started squirming in the theatre. But it's no kind of film. Mel is bad, Helen Hunt is her usual flat self. So is Marisa Tomei. actually the only person i liked in this film was Ashley Johnson, as Mel's daughter, who did her best work since she played the new Seaver kid on growing pains.
