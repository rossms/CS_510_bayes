London is one of the most fun and interesting places I've been to. There's something for everyone. Clubs, theatres, restuarants, museums, and practically everything one could think of. The people are friendly and the drinking age is 18! The theatre abound is excellent! The cost of living and traveling is generally more expensive than the U.S., however there are ways of getting around this. An overall GREAT place to go.
