I have only been to Yosemite twice but I plan on visiting again and again as long as I live in Northern California. The valley is breath taking, unlike anywhere I have ever been. I have also hiked in the back country and found it beautiful and peaceful. There is so much to see in Yosemite that one trip will not do it. My goal is to see it in every season, for it changes drastrically, becoming a new wonderland with each visit.
