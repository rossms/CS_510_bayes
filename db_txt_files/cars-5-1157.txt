An excellent choice for a compact. Its half gas, half electric. Sure, it won't win any races; but it does have enough power to get you around. Enviormentalists will love it. The Prius is much better than the Insight, it actually has a trunck and a back seat. But don't think you'll save any money when buying an electric- The Prius starts around $20k, deep in midsize sedan territory
