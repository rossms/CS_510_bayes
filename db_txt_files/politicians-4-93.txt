She is married to Prince Edward. Her father was a retired tire salesman and her mother was an Irish-born secretary, so she has some good qualities, I'm sure. She got a little ink when her topless photos were run in the press. I guess she (ahem) posed for them before she married Eddie. The famous My Eddie's not gay, line is attributed to her.
