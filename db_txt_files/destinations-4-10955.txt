Built as the first Six Flags Park. Six Flags Over Texas. Themed to each country that once owned Texas (except the Gotham CIty section). They have Mr. freeze which is a VERY VERY good coaster. Batman: The Ride..ehh it's not that great. Texas Giant is pretty good too. Titan..Well thats' a really awsome coaster. 265 feet tall. And Judge Rot SCream i think is a fun ride. It's a Six Flags Park so don't expect it to be well, anything but thrills. They got Shockkwave near the bakc of the park. That's a VEry good ride. A MUST RIDE. It's notthe tallest or fastest. But it's REALLY good.
