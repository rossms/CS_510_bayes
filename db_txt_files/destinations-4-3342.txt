New Orleans is FULL of culture and has many more attractions other than Mardi Gras (ie New Years, Sugar Bowl, and The Jazz Festival, just to name a few). I enjoyed my visit quite a bit but I would have to admit that I would not like to live there. Oh, and if you will be there for a visit may I suggest the Hilton Riverside!
