Great if not the best campus in Boston. They have the newest dorms/apartments, facilities and the admin puts a lot of money back into the school. Not to mention its a fun school! But the cost is way too much by the time one graduates you will owe around $70g+. Suffolk University is half the price but the campus is much smaller.
