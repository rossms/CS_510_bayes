Japanese cuisine is probably my favourite in the world. Their culture is baffling, but kind of quaint and cute. If you aren't of asian appearance though, prepare to be openly gawked at everywhere you go. If you are blonde and female, people of both genders will just walk up and touch your hair and grope you, since they are one of the most ethnically uniform societies in the world. Still, you will never visit a safer and cleaner country, even though Tokyo has more people most countries do.
