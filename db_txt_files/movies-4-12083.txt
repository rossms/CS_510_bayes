 Summer Catch really was one of the better romantic comedies to be produced by this new generation of teen WB actors. I thought that the plot was solid, and Matthew Lilliard as usual was whacky and hilarious. A great performance (very unusual) by Freddie Prinze Jr. I reccomend it if you're in the mood for romance, comedy and baseball.
