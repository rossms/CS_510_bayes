To brie or not to brie! If it is to brie, make it St. Andre! I love it lighted dusted with flour, then put into beaten egg, rolled in crushed almonds and sauteed in olive oil until golden brown. Drizzle with a bit of honey mustard and serve with a warm toasted baguette, apple slices and some grapes and a glass of bubbly. Bon appetit!
