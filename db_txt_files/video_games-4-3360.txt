Final Fantasy VII gets you emotionally involved in the gameplay. The story line, graphics, and battle system are excellent! Unfortunately, the character development is a little stagnant. Except for the main characters, (Cloud, Aemis...etc.) you are not interested in using the characters you acquire.
