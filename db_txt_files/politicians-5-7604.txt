Abraham Lincoln was a very strong United States president. His goal was to preserve the union and he did that with every molecule of his body. He led the union into the Civil War to preserve the nation and abolish slavery. Abrahham Lincoln was assassinated five days after Confederates surrendered. He is one of the presidents sculpted on Mount Rushmore in South Dakota. May this great president never be forgotten!
