As a Midwesterner, Philadelphia is my favorite East Coast city because it is an eminently cosmopolitan without being overwhelming. The museums are numerous and outstanding, the orchestra is one of the world's finest, and the history of the colonial and early federal periods is everywhere in evidence. Unhappily, in a post-9/11 defensive frenzy, the great landmarks of our nation (Independence Hall, the Liberty Bell, etc.) have been surrounded by hideous barricades.
