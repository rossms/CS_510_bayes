Jon Gruden is the best coach in the NFL, no matter what anyone says. He may still be young and have some things to learn but nobody has done what he has done with his teams and he is only going to get better. To all of those who think he is terrible or has no talent need to lay off the pipe and actually watch the game or remember what coach brought the Bucs to win their first ever Super Bowl!
