This book tells a simple, yet beautiful story which will always be a classic. Every kid I know who has read it started it reluctantly and ended up loving the book. It provides good morals for children. It has themes of perseverance, value of a good attitude and selflessness, and the value of friends. The only negative thing is the very blatantly racist references toward Indians. It should be remembered, though, that the author was a product of the time.
