I'm prejudiced because I was born in VA, but I will agree with an earlier post-er that there are two Virginias...around MD/DC (where I also lived for 7 yrs and despised) and the rest of the state. Even Richmond is not that bad. Great for history (Charlottesville,Jamestown,Williamsburg,Richmond) and scenery (Saltville,Marion,Chilhowie,Mechanicsburg,Manassas) my pick would be southwestern Va where I was born in the Clinch Mts due to its bucolic nature...rich in folk and musical heritage.
