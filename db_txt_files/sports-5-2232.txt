Redbird294, I got 2 words for you: Yankees Choke . They have been doing it for 2 straight years and it looks like we are heading to another good ol Yankee drought. by the way weren't your Yankees considered one year wonders in 1996?? nobody knew they were gonna win 3 more in 98, 99, 00. Who knows what can happen. season hasn't started. besides...nothing wrong with one year wonders, we had those in 1980s remember?? no repeat champions, no Yankee victories...yet we saw some of the greatest World Series games of all time.
