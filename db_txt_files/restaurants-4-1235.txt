Great assortment of delicious donuts (as long as you get them fresh) Their Apple Fritters are the best (stick them in the microwave for a little bit) Of course, I have heard the horror stories about the rats in the display window (in NYC) and the poor food handling and storage conditions..but, hey they make a great boston creme.
