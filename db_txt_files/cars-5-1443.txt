This is a great car. I've had mine for a year and haven't had a single problem. It is great on gas...I fill it up about once every week (at the most) and it costs about 14.00 to fill. Music sounds great in this car, there are 5 speakers set up throughout the car. Lots of compartments make it easy to keep the car clean. It is deceptively big inside. I have no problem fitting 4 people comfortably in the car and that's always their first comment. The trunk is also huge. The biggest thing I can say about the car is that it is very reliable.
