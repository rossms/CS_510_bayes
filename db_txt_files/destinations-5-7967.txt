Great place to watch a game. The park has a beautiful view of the Rocky Mountains, and because of the high thin air, balls tend to fly much further here. The area around Coors Field is called LoDo and has become a very popular area of Denver, with lots of bars and restaurants. The overall feel is very similar to the area around Wrigley Field in Chicago, which is a nice compliment considering Coors Field is only about a decade old and Wrigley has had 100 years to try and accomplish that same feel.
