You know what? I dunno what to put. There aren't words to express how much I love this album. People who say that limp bizkit sucks, please just sit down and listen to it because most of the time you're cussin' without a reason. And to the people who say that this album is too similar to Significant Other.... are you deaf? It does not and so what if it did? It doesn't make it any less brilliant. My favourite track on this album is either The one or Hold on. They are both really powerful. It just blew me away.
