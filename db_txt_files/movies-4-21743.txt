I thought that this was the best movie I had ever seen until the last 30 minutes. GOOD GOD! Then I said, I have never seen a worse ending to a movie. How could they be so dumb as to put one final ending on the movie, after the elves had sailed off into the sunset? Sam was not the protagonist; it was not important for us to see that he lived on and had a family and etc. If I had it my way, every single one of the members of the Fellowship would have died to dispose of the Ring. That scene where they all jump onto Frodo's bed made my eyes roll. A 6-star movie, taken down 2 notches by its horrible ending.
