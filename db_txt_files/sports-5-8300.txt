His acting is cute. I think he's under rated if anything due to his inability to be a ball hogging showman. All these people 'n kids have ADD now and have to see sparks 'n flash. This is BASKETBALL, not a gay glitter show, and Tim has the GAME down to a perfect T. This is a man to look up to, rather than an accused rapist and a big fat guy who can't stop from cursing(whining) on tv about the refs. He is some of the only LIFE LEFT of the NBA. The realest. Not Hollywood.
