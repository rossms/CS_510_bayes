i got these cigarettes because it was buy one get one free so i said, why not. i usually smoke anything menthol and i dont like to say anything is bad unless i try it. what i ended up doing is giving the rest of the pack to my friend and i'm keeping the other one unless i run out of cigarettes when money is low. they were much too strong for me and i figured why it was buy one get one free. i would rather get a cheap brand like GPC's or Silver before I buy these again.
