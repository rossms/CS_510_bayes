This is the place to go for Americanized Mexican food. Nice sized portions and a wide selection on the menu, including vegetarian meals. Great chips and salsa too. The fried ice cream is a good after-dinner topper. A few years ago I was eating some of the abovementioned ice cream and found a piece of glass in it! Needless to say we got our dinner for free and many apologies from the manager (probably thought I was going to sue them after biting into a piece of glass!)
