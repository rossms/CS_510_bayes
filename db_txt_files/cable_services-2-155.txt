It gets 2 stars only because it is cheaper later on after you pay an arm and a leg to get it started. I used to hate how you couldn't get the local channels, too. But I guess you can get them now. But I still prefer my cable, thank you. If DIRECTV gets a little cheaper later on, maybe I will give it a better review.
