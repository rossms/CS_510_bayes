(Rating based on a single trip to the Baltimore Inner Harbor location): I was a little daunted by the rows of expensive cheesecakes which lined the displays by the front, but oh well, it was worth a shot, and I'm glad I took it. Despite it being rather busy, the wait staff was courteous and friendly. Fairly reasonable prices were also a bonus. The portions were pretty big and well-presented. I can't find a thing to complain about. Worth going again.
