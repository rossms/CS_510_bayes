You have to keep in mind - he INHEREITED a state with a huge debt projection. Romney took over a state where liberal democrats spend money like I drink beer. Romney is faced with finding the funding. The liberal State Congress wont cooperate with him. When there are tax dollars to spend, they put it towards handouts and pork. When the money dries up, the cut essentials but leave the waste alone, then whoever is in office gets the blame.
