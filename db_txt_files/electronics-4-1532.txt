I think these are perhaps the most underrated speakers on the market. I feel like I am a pretty jive guy, and when i put on my Boston Acoustics, my crib be bumpin . People be knocking on my door sayin, you so crazy . Great sound quality at a various range of volumes. Excellent clarity at all frequencies.
