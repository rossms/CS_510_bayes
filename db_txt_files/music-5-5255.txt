What a nice, soothing CD. I don't consider myself much of a country music fan, but I can recognize that this CD is something special. Most of the songs seem to follow the theme of heartbreak and the difficulty of moving on from a relationship, but Lucinda manages to cover this relatively tired theme in a unique and touching way. I would recommend this CD for listeners who have experimented with Americana style music (e.g. Wilco, Blue Mountain, Son Volt), but do not consider themselves full fledged country music fans.
