I have to admit, tied for the #2 place I'd want to visit in the world (along with India and Russia, #1 Germany). To just talk about Cuba as a vaction spot is horrible, not that vacationing there is horrible, it is just they have so much more than pretty beaches and beautiful scenery... like culture, food, dance and drink! Amazingly so close to the USA, but somehow (unlike Canada unfortunately) has managed to keep its rich culture despite the extremely strong American influence on the world.
