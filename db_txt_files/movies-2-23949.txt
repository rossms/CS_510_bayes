Ummmm . . . ignoring the impossibility of it all, and the lame title (I mean, come on! This could be a runner-up for worst movie title, especially considering how ridiculous it sounded when they tried to make it sound scary in the previews . . . funny, though . . . ) it was a pretty average disaster movie, except instead of focusing on one type of disaster, they make one big one that encompasses several. Good special effects couldn't save it from a fairly dull story. Nothing special.
