I like Gatorade because it is not controlled by one of the soft drink giants attempting to control everything from entire cities like Atlantic City to our schools and sports programs. Now they are even trying to control price as it relates to weather. Gatorade is owned by a big company, but is making it on its own reputation, which is based on a great product.
