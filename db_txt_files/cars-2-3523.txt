DavidTx - I bought my 1994 Pathy in May 2004. I like the way it looked and test drove in town. I live in Wyoming and drive to work all over the state and it is dissapointing me in performance.Going up hills it loses power, it shifts down when it should not.If someone could give me some input as to what kind of power it should have i would appreciate it.
