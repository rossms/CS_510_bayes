Pakistani people had not seen a leader who cared about the country in a long time and they are glad they found musharraf. He is so much better then the previous leaders pakistan has had, and people are actualyy releaved to see a leader who cares about the country and is not interested in lotting it. Right now, he is a wave of fresh air; even though I do not approve of him giving american troops permission to stay in Pakistan. He is going to stay in power for a long time. God Willing.
