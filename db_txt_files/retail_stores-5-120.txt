A terrific place for finding more obscure or out of print books, and the reviews from readers are a terrific bonus. However, I find I still buy the majority of my books at physical stores. There's something about being in an actual bookstore, with the books and the atmosphere, that you just can't get online. Amazon is absoultely terrific if you're looking for something specific, but for general browsing, I'm not sure it's as useful.
