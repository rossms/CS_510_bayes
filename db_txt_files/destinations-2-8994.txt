Tried this just the other day, just to see if its as bad as people say, well its way too sweet,the flavor dosen't last, it lacks the punch of skoal straight, and the numbness spreading across the jawbone of cope fine-cut (my two staple brands), but these would all be forgivable if it weren's so damn hard to find fresh, in Canada at least, the one i got was nearly a year old, so what you basically have is saccharine, short lived, character-free crap thats nearly impossible to find fresh, I was generous giving it a 2.
