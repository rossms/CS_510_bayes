Probably my favorite silent-movie comedian. His movies have a few more subtle jokes to contrast his incredible stunts, which he literally risked his life for. I don't care for silent movies very much, but spending a little while watching Keaton do his inventive gags for a half-hour or so provides some pleasant entertainment. Both Steamboat Bill Jr. and Sherlock Jr. are classics!
