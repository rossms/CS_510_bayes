All Great Lakes cities are great places to live, Milwaukee is no exception. The only reason for its segregation is because all of the white people live in the southern part of the city, and all of the Black people live in the Northern part. They are both at fault for it being segregated because neither side will budge. But other than that, great place, just like all Great Lakes cities (except detroit & cleveland)
