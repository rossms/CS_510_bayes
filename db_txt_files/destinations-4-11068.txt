While no theme park I've been to yet has been perfect, this one is good. The roller coasters, especially the excellent Scream Machine, are exciting and fast. The other rides, from the amusing bumper cars, the thrilling airplanes and the relaxing chairrides are great. The food is overpriced. I only ate at the McDonald's branch, where the prices were roughly 25% higher than they were outside. The lines were long for some rides, but the wait was worth it. I just hated the bugs. Overall, a good quality experience for a good time! Have fun!
