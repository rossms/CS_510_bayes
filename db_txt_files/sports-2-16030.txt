There is one word that describes the creature who is the topic of discussion (and it's not primetime either!): BRAGGART!!!!! He would make great friends with Muhammed Ali. This will be a great surprise for many of my friends from the north who know about my southern whereabouts. I really don't care how allaround he was, the point is that many baseball/football players are better even if Deion Sanders thinks he is primetime !
