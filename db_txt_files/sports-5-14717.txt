Johnny Frickin Ballgame....The Winningest QB of all time. Enough Said. Ok, I'll say more. He never had a supporting cast until TD came along. But TD was just that...supporting. Elway carried the Broncos since he was drafted. He had a cannon for an arm and a the passion for success that can only be rivaled by Brett Favre (who idolizes Elway). Marino never even made it to the Super Bowl and had 50 some rushing yards. Montana had an outstanding supporting cast. There is no comparison...watch The Drive and you'll feel the same way.
