They have dominated(execept for a close call at LSU) and may just be the best team in college football. They play in the SEC which is the toughest conference and if they remain undefeated they will be part of the top 4(USC, OKlahoma Miami, Auburn). All of which are currently undefeated and deserve a orange bowl berth. This is why they need a playoff or extra bowl to pit the top bowl winners.
