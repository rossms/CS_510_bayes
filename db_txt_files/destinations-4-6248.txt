Everytime I go to Georgia, I love it more and more. The people are great, as is the food. Most people really think of Atlanta as the only place in this state, but if you go elsewhere, you will find all kinds of wonderful things to see and do, and best of all, the people are just awesome almost everywhere. I do like Atlanta however. My greatest friend in the world lives there, and it really is a beautful metro city. I also highly recommend Savannah.
