I loved Sarah for the first 3 seasons of Buffy, and then of course I have liked her acting in all of the movies she has starred in. I think she has a very promising future ahead of her. Now that Buffy has been cancelled, she needs to quit playing around and start doing more serious roles just like she did in Cruel Intentions. Which is her best film to date. And I think her sexiness is very underrated. She is a screen siren !
