I strongly dislike the football program, but if we're supposed to be rating teams on results, you have to give Florida State five stars. It's amazing what Bobby Bowden has accomplished there. Every year they dominate, and every year they attract another top recruiting class. Sure a lot of the players get into trouble, but it seems like that's happening to almost every major collge athletic program these days.
