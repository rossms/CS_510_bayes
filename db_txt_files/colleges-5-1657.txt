I was in the College of Arts and Sciences, English major. I do not believe I could have had a better education. My professors were extraordinary. The size was just right to me - not too big, not too small. And, I loved the campus so much - leaving was really really hard. To me, Georgetown was home. My one complaint is how conservative the student body was at the time - not sure if this is still the case.
