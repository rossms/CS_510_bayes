He should be ahead of Jefferson without a doubt. Probably tied with Lincoln. Without him, there would be no US, none of these other presidents would matter at all, they would probably not have even existed. WE WOULD ALL BE BRITISH AND HAVE REALLY BAD TEETH AND DRINK TEA HOT!!!! But seriously now, the original American Patriot, all of that pride that we all have now, he was the first to have it, and the reason that we all have it now. AND HIS TEETH WERE MADE OF HIPPO BONE, NOT WOOD. He never chopped down the cherry tree either, but everyone knows that.
