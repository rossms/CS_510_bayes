Ah the beauteous Trent. How staggering that not only does T Reznor posess one of the sexiest voices ever to bless recorded soundwaves but also continues to write brilliant, innovative and creatively dangerous records. How ingenious and brave to not succumb to the no doubt, expected, pressures of writing another 'Downward Spiral'. Another boundlessly beautiful album from an artist we are blessed to hear.
