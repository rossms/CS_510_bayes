I've been riding for 12 years. Have owned a Honda Interceptor 500, Honda CBR 600, Honda CB500four, Yamaha XS750 special, Yamaha XS650, Suzuki GS550ES, Kawasaki Ninja 250, BMW K750 all nice bikes. I just recently was in the process of buying a 2005 Kawasaki Ninja ZX10 when at the last minute I came across a 2006 Harley Davidson Sportster 1200 Roadster in racing Orange. Immediately I fell in love with it, bought it on the spot. Had a stage 1 screaming eagle kit installed. All Ill say is I will never go back to the rice burners!!
