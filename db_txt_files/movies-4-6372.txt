Audrey Hepburn is perfect as the unhappy princess who just wants to be a regular person. she escapes while visiting in Rome. and meets a reporter played by Gregory Peck. At first after finding out who she is he tells her he will take her on a tour of Rome with the intention of getting pictures and writing an article.by the end he finds he loves her and does not do the report. at the very end he sees her at the embasssy where she had to go back. sad because as much as the audience would like for them to get together we know they cannot. good movie.
