I agree with Seraph, Old Navy does have more flare. But Gap has better sizes for smaller people than Old Navy. Old Navy's styles is all about funky and wild, while Gap is more preppy. I like both. Gap has good sizes, the stores are clean, but they're pricey. But I'm willing to spend more for a comfortable fit.
