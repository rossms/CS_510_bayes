Lousy actress who won her first Oscar for NOT dying in the London in 1961, and her second for playing her loud, vulgar blousy self in Virginia Woolfe. She was beautiful when she was young but now resembles a fat old Christmas tree fairy. She never had any class or taste and even with all those diamonds she still looked like a walking Woolworths.
