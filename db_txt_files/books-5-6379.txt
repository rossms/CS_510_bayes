Ann Coulter makes some good points, but she also is a knee-jerk conservative. Ironically, she's just like Jesse Jackson; she interprets every issue through her myopic, tunnel-vision, viewpoint. Instead of thinking, she puts each issue within her conservative framework, which is why she sometimes is right on target but hopelessly wrong other times. She is very intelligent, but also dogmatic. She tries to be funny, and I seriously doubt that she really means everything that she says in her book. It's entertaining and thought-provoking. She's also a very beautiful woman, and an interesting person.
