Swiss is a fun cheese, with all the little holes in it; it's a mild cheese, it can really compliment a good sandwich. Depending on the brand, it's also pretty good cubed and eaten alone. This isn't for those who prefer something sharper, and sometimes it really depends on mood on whether I want it or not, but overall it's a good cheese!
