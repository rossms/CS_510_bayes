Spyro is a very good game all around. It has great gameplay and very good graphics. The puzzles in the game are challenging enough to make you think. Most are not hard, but some do take a while to figure out. The different worlds in the game is also very interesting. You start off in what looks like the courtyard of a castle and may end up in a desert, or a land controlled by a Jack-O-lantern.
