A must see if you are in Dallas. Probably the best view of the skyline from this 560 foot tower. You can have lunch or dinner at the top of the rotating sphere. The viewing deck is just above the restaurant and admission is just $2.00 and it is opened till 10:00. The elevator to the top is quick and it is glass enclosed so you can see out. Tower is connected underground to the famous glass Hyatt Regency hotel and rail system. It is just a couple blocks from the Sixth Floor museum.
