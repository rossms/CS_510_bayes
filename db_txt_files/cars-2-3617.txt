I have the 2002 and cannot wait for the lease to be up... I like it (note: not love it) it's rugid and very truck like (which I like) but it handles terribly in snow (light in the back and heavy up top) If you live where it snows, I would NOT reccommend it!!! I have had so many close calls (with the 4x4 on!)
