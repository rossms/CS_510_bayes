yes sds has a good point about hollywood always making americans the big heroes (which is why i thoroughly appreciated proof of life). and i'm well aware that it was mostly the british that went out capturing those encryption machine thingamabobbers. but as a movie, i'd have to say this is definitely a classic submarine action movie...a silver-medal cousin of some of the great sub movies of recent times (red october, crimson tide, etc). less drama but definitely a good ride.
