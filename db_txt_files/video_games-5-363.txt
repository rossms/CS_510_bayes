I loved MYST. It did not operate properly with Windows ME, it gets through the first board lets you go into one other world and does not work. Although, MYST works exceptionally well and beautifully with Windows XP (Professional). I loved the game and I would play it again, It is a definite keeper to hand down to my daughter. I can not wait to try its siblings...LOL.
