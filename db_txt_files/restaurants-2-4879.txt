We had reservations here for a small group and they refused to let us sit down 15 minutes before our scheduled time EVEN THOUGH the place was half empty. Our party included two elderly women (in their 70s 80s) who could not stand for long periods of time. It was simply rude. On top of that, the food was badly prepared and we were quite unhappy.
