The best ride out of all the big bore atv's in this class. Best overall looks as well. 1300+ miles on mine so far. ZERO problems. I ride mud, hard pack, creeks, mx tracks, snow, etc. This atv also will not wear you out after riding all day. It is just a joy to ride! Swap out the stock tires to any aftermarket 6-ply tire and the bike performes even better! No low range, but what people forget about this 650 is that it has a torq converter to make up for that. It does just fine pulling heavy trailers, rock crawling, or playing in the thick mud.
