He has the speed but if he went up against kobe, francis,t-mac, etc.!!!Those real players would contain kirk!!Forget it!!!He doesnt have great handels!!All this guy has is speed!!And he gets rejected a lot!!!When hes not scoring inside, hes shooting a bunch of 3's!!I'm still waiting for him to bring his game out more!!!I'm not impressed yet!!!
