When i was a young lad, i loved the museum of science so much that my parents bought me a season pass so i could go whenever. although it still brings back old memories, the stuff there is getting kind of old and lots of it you can probably go online to find out about it. But going to the omni theatre is a great experience, as is the electricity theater. I love playing the virtual volleyball there!
