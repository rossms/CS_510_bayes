The beach itself is great. ONE IMPORTANT REMINDER: Do not use www.pirentals.com or Padre Island Rentals to book. I booked for Aquarius for $970/4-nts then I asked to move to Bahia Mar which was around $1270/4-nts. They offered Saida Towers for the Bahia Mar price since Bahia was booked. When I got home, my bill was $1560/4-nts -- the actual Saida Towers published rate. Up to now, none of those lying fat pigs at front desk and reservations would like to acknowledge and correct the issue. Other than these pathetic dollar-faced low lives, the place is an absolute charm.
