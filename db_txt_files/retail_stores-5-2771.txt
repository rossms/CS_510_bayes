I bought my fiancee, Diana, a terrific 2.0 carat ideal cut diamond engagement ring in a platinum setting from Reeds Jewelers. Althougth the web site was very easy to follow and gave a lot of information, I still wasn't sure what I wanted, so I chatted with their experts, who helped me understand the options and pick the best ring for the money that a) Diana would love, and b) wouldn't blow my budget. It came on time with all the documentation, and was just as impressive as I'd hoped. I highly recommend Reeds.com.
