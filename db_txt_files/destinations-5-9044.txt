A dazzling place to be in, Zanzibar is. You will be begged and harried and badgered constantly by the salesmen and women at the nearest bazaar to buy whatever beads, drinks, fortunes, or whatever else they are selling. But the little island itself is absolutely magical. Went there a year ago on a vacation...and recently found out that I may have walked right by the birthplace of Freddie Mercury while wearing my FM sweat! How unfair that I didn't realize it at the time! Take care, everyone!
