Ragu spaghetti sauce is usually the one I like to buy.they offer many different flavors in several sizes. I like the meat flavored one myself. For prepackaged foods this one tastes good.An almost 4. not too bad for packages sauces. Not great either. but if someone does not want to make homemade Ragu is not too bad.
