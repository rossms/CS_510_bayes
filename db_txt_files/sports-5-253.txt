Not only is he a great player, he is a great person. He is a throwback kind of guy who jsut enjoys playing the game of baseball. He does as much in the community as he does on the field. He is as clutch as they come, and is better than Jeter in absolutely every category. And none of this Jeter is a winner crap, put Nomar on the Yankees and he comes with better stats in a padded line-up, and the yankees still win those rings. I can only hope the Sox sign him when his contract comes up.
