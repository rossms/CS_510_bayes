Bill Clinton was undoubtedly the smartest President the US has ever elected. Despite his weakness where the opposite sex is concerned, this man knew his thing and was very influential in turning the US economy around during his tenure. If you want to see the proof in the pudding.. just look at the job that Bush is doing compared to Clinton.. Bush is wrecking pure chaos on the economy.
