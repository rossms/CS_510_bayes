Fran is great coach, just look at his record, what is there to argue with. Fran has turned many programs around including Alabama, so get the chip off your shoulder. He left ya'll in alot better shape than you were when he got there. Anyway, I don't see how you all think he left for more money when he left a clause in his contract saying that if a few schools, including A&M, offered him a job, he had no legal binding to stay at Alabama. Fran just knows how great an atmosphere there is at A&M and wanted to be a part.
