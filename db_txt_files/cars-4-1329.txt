I have 2002 passat GLX 4-Motion. I look forward to driving this car everytime I sit in the driver's seat! Fairly quiet ride-some wind noise on fwy. Smooth most of the time-tire noise on rough roads, but better than most other cars I've driven. Interior and exterior styling can't be beat in this class!
