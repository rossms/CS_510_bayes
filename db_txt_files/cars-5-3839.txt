The Escape is a great little SUV for zipping around town, dashing to the beach, or scooting up to the mountains. I've had compliments from folks age 8-80 on how stylish and comfortable my vehicle is. I'm getting about 21-22 mph with about 60/40 city/highway driving on my V-6, 2WD, XLT. I think Ford has a few minor details to iron out (interior lighting is a little lacking, drink holders are too shallow), but for a first year vehicle......it's the greatest!
