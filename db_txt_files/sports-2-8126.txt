Vince Carter is the biggest pansy in the league. Last season he ran into Stan Van Gundy (Heat coach who is maybe 5'9 165) and Carter went down like a ton of bricks and rolled around on the floor for a while. Van Gundy didn't even go down and after the game he had a black eye to show for it. Carter has no desire and no heart to go with his skills. The Raptors should dump him now while he still has some value.
