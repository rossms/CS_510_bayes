Most of what I've tried in this line has been okay. On the upside, they make them convenient for dieters and diabetics alike. On the downside -I kind of have a problem with the mega-company that produces them. It's like they have a built-in group of consumers they can almost force (or suggest very strongly) to buy their stuff. Kind of creepy.
