There is nothing better than going to a movie and expecting the worst, and getting something half way decent. The cinematography was excellent, the storyline interesting (if simple), and Leo was tolerable. If you have ever had the travel bug - and not the 1-2 week vacation kind of travel - this movie will awaken it.
