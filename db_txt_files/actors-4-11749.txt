Interesting actress. I really enjoyed her in the Tomb Raider movies, Girl, Interrupted & in Taking Lives. Quirky & different, she definitely has her own drummer (whole band?) to march to. Love that she doesn't try to fit into the mold of all other actresses. THANK GOD!!! The worst thing an actor/actress can do, in my book, is bore me. Looking for more good work from her. :)
