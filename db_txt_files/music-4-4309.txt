Excellent overview of the Stones career. There are a couple of songs that I don't consider to be in the same class as their greatest , but most of the songs deserve to be on here--Satisfaction, Under My Thumb, Paint It Black, Beast of Burden, Start Me Up, Mixed Emotions, several more great ones. My main objection is the fact that they released this as a two-cd set and couldn't find room for Time Is On My Side or Harlem Shuffle .
