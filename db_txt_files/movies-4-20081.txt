I thought this movie was very original. No one ever thought of trying to trick people into believing this movie was real. Although the writers didn't necessarily tell everyone it was real, it was very much assumed. It was an early feeling for the simple fact that if it were real it would be pretty scary. I would have given it a 5 but the ending could have ended better.
