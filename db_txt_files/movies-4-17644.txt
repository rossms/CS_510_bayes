A Danish family and friends assemble at a hotel to celebrate a prosperous businessman's 60th birthday.When a prodigal son turns up uninvited,the tributes don't proceed as planned.The first film made according to Dogme 95 principles of pure cinema (Hand-held camera,location shooting,natural lighting,direct sound) is a ferocious attack on Bourgeois respectability.Director Vinterberg allies Bunuelian wit to merciless rapier precision,for a superb satire which has sharp teeth and bites.Be warned!
