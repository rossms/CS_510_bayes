We will start out with the most important thing, the pizza itself. Unlike Papa John's, it offers Deep Dish, which is always a bonus! Their sauce is good and alot like Pizza Hut. The cheese is also good, but not as good as Papa John's cheese. They also over soft drinks and the delicious Cinnasticks! Their delivery service falls square in the middle between the lightning-quick Papa John's and slower-than-the-Pokeiest-Pokemon Pizza Hut and typically take 30 to 45 minutes. Their prices also quite good.
