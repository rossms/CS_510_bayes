A fine all around bourbon. It has a smooth long taste. This or any other fine bourbon should not be mixed with anything. If you are going to mix Makers Mark with coke why don't you just drink some warm Pabst Blue Ribbon straight from the rusty can? Seriously, a few ice cube and maybe a splash of water. Enjoy it for what it is.
