Although I'm not from The United Arab Emirates, I find Dubai a safe haven where children, business people and the elderly can live happily ever after ..... it's not only the cleanliness or the modernism of Dubai that makes it heaven. Rather it's the way the rulers and the citizens of that emirate treat the expatriates ... with utmost respect .... without no discrimination ....
