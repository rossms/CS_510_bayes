I use to have a 86 Mazda B-2000 . It was about the best little truck I've ever seen, even pushing an old lady (in her car) off the ice at an intersection, going uphill. Had alot of guts for a little truck. I need bigger now, but have respect for these Mazdas. One person here says they're a Ford not made in the U.S...well, my mechanic looked up the numbers on mine it was made in Japan imported here. Not ALL are the Ford type. Another says if want want to haul this ain't the truck...well, if you knew you wanted to haul big time, why didn't you buy a bigger truck. These ARE mini trucks.
