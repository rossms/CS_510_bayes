Excellent series! Picks up 15 years after the end of Farseers trilogy and delivers a splendid portion of action and intrigue. Not as grim as Farseers, but still genuine. Fitz's stuation improves, but Robin Hobb still seems to have a different sense of Happy Ending compared to the most of the genre. Maybe that's one of reason of series' success... Fitz and Fool, Burrich and Chade, we will miss you!
