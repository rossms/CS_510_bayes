hands down the best QB ever, considering the team he was working with. If joe montana didn't have rice and craig, hell all of the 49ers roster of the 80s and 90s; he wouldn't even compare to marino. even steve young has posted better stats then montana. I mean come on, no other QB (besides Peyton Manning) has thrown 48 TDs in a single season, let alone more then 5,000 passing yards. Give Rice to Marino and i garauntee everyones all-time favorite QB would be Marino.
