Visited Tucson in May and it was over 100 degrees. Windy, dusty and extremely hot. Seems more like a large suburban area than a large city. Strip malls and fast food places galore. I know it was hot but the city seemed deserted. No one walking around, just people driving with their windows rolled up. Not much going on downtown. Not much culture either. No thanks.
