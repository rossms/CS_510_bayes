dunhill king size filter tastes great, pretty smooth, it does feel a bit too light for a full flavour though but its still very good. i just like the flavour better then most of any other brands ive tried, doesnt have a chemical taste or anything, i was pretty surprised about the nicotine though( not that i care) it was 1.4-3.0. anyways best thing next to marlboros and sometimes better. and as for pureatuer, r u kidding a bit too strong? how long u been smoking like a week, these r actually a bit lighter then most other full flavours.
