Boring, overrated, and strange. This has to be one of the most overrated movies of all time. I rented this movie because I was told it was a classic and very good, but I was very disappointed. And the ending was so weird, after I watched it I though, what the hell was that? A classic? I mean, it wasn't that bad, but I definitely expected it to be better. I like Jack Nicholson, he was great in As Good as it Gets, but this movie was not very good. If you want to watch a movie about a mental institution, Girl, Interruped is better.
