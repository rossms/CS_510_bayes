quality actually just depends on the individual store itself. but they get 4 because they stand by their policy if you are not happy they will credit you for the next or replace it right away. you dont see that too much in alot of companies any more. in fact one pizza place that we use is locally owned but they deliver all night from one end of our valley to the other. it also costs a little more but the quality is at the top but nobodys perfect but this pizza place thinks so if they happen to make a mistake no use complaining they wont believe you any way. but despite that its so good so its worth it
