Hi Kurtvedder here. I must say that this filmclip typifies the pain and suffering shown by the tortured souls who don't conform to what is cool. By portraying him as a tragic artist they are almost making a mockery of the whole elitist attitudes shown by some. Also by picturing the fellow students in a still shot we can see them being portrayed as lifeless, cold, and unfeeling. I feel that this filmclip shows so much. I think it is also important to point out that their is a bible passage in it. This is Genesis 3:16. Look it up if you get a chance it adds even more insight.
