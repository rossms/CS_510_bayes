bravo. this game deserves a 6 not a 5. the story was preety cool. ico and yorda had a cute little relationship. its also preety cute when you load your file up the game starts again with the 2 of them sleeping on the couch together. the ending was beyond beautiful. if you hate this game your simply heartless.
