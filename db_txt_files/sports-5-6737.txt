I saw Tim Floyd when he was coach of the UNO Privateers in the late 80's (or early 90's). He had a team w/o a player taller than 6ft 5in. and won the conference. He can flat out coach. He had comparable success later at Iowa State. He would have won more games with the Hornets if he had been kept on. The man who followed him sure (Byron Scott) sure hasn't gotten a lot done with that team. USC is gonna be a lot of fun to watch this year!
