Its a good song.... it actually makes you think. Its a song with an actual story line that goes along with it. Elton john made this song great.... I love the song with Elton John in it... I think it has to be the most mixed up pair to ever sing at the grammys.... but the song sounds so great it had a lot of emotion and it really got me into Elton John and made my view point of a corrupt discreminating white rapper it to a person that i learned to accept and some how respect.
