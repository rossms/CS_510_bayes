Mandela has read the signs of the times: reconciliation and forgiving as the ways to peace. Even though it seemingly was't possible to fully put it into practice in his political life, he leaves a great legacy. I regard him as one of the great personalities of the 20th century and a inspiration for us in approaching the 21st.
