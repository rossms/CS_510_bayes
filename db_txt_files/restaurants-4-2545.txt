The most popular of the fast foods. I used to love getting the Happy Meals. I've always liked Chicken McNuggets but Wendy's nuggets are still far better. Their burgers are horrible, worse than Burger King's, and a thousand times worse than Wendy's. I like their fries a lot, more than Burger King's, but not quite as much as Wendy's. I like the McChicken too. They should bring back the mozzarella sticks!!!
