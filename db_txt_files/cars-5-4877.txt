I have a GMC Sonoma ZR2 (Highrider). It's been a great vehicle thus far. I haven't had it off road but have been through some nasty snow sleet and rain with it. Gets me where I want to go and looks great doing it. I had a Jimmy before it and it was good too. Did'nt get another because I needed the hauling capabilities. Has a very good engine with the vortec 4300. Have been pulling a 4000 lb trailer with no problem. Can hardly tell it's back there. Would buy another Sonoma, but figure this one to last me forever.
