Derek Jeter is a 4 in my book. He is an average hitter .320-18-80, but for $18 million a year, that is way too much. He is way over paid, and a bit overrated. His offense is average, and his defense is below average. You can't knock the guy, I mean he has 4 rings and is as clutch as you can get. He is definitely an average player in Kansas City, Pittsburgh, or Milwaukee. He seems to be a nice guy and has a nice personality, to bad he is on the damn Yankees..ha ha....
