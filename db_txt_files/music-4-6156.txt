I am really not a rock fan, and I think Limp Bizkit and his Significant Other CD definitely falls under that category. Yet, I bought the CD for one track, Shut the F**k Up, featuring Method Man. I really respect when artists cross genres to create a new sound, that can be appreciated by a bigger audience.
