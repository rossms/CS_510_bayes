One of my favorite movies! Beautiful songs, beautiful costumes, beautiful set design, beautiful people, beautiful love story, just beautiful! That being said ... The best thing about this movie is the love story. The second best thing is Ewan Mcgregor and his beautiful voice. I could listen to him sing all day! There are a couple of things in this movie that kinda left me with a bad taste in my mouth like the scene where they sing like a virgin. I'm still wondering why they put that in there. But overall, a very good movie that I enjoy very much.
