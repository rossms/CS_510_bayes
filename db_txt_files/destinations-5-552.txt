I'm from LA, and I stop by in SJ on my way to St Croix VI, wihthout great expectations, now my opinion it's completly different. It's a a large city with a charm, full of history, and friendly people. Goodlatin an international food,a lot of art (good contemporary an classic), beautifull beaches, a great bars....I know the Caribean very well, I been there many times, actually it is my favorite vacation, but this was (by accident) my 1st time in San Juan...Whithout a doubt, best and most cosmopolitant city of the islands....Go there, it is much better than most of our plain cookie cut cities.
