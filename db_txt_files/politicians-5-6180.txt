Best Representative the 5th district has ever had. He's been servicing Wisconsin for more than twenty years and receives much support from his constituents; he won 86% of the vote in the last election. Sensenbrenner also helped incorporate the patriot act but tried to make it more moderate. And he does not way that much. I've seen many people who weigh more than him.
