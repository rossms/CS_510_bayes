The prices are low and its good enough for beer and T.P. but they are playing the people are sheep game and we're being manipulated. First they discontinued the express lanes for folks with just a few items, now they've eliminated the hand held baskets. What genius decided making life less convenient for shoppers would make them buy more! No gourmet items, just cheap bread and big oversided carts for our shopping pleasure. Lame but at least it isn't Albertson's, now they really suck!
