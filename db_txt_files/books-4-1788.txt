I used to skip FBOFW when reading the comics page of my newspaper. Every strip was either serious or a poor attempt at humor. But when I started checking out the collections from my library, I began to develop a liking for the storylines, nice artwork, developed characters, and the cool fact that the characters age over the years (a pretty rare phenomenon). I haven't checked out any of Johnston's recent work, so this rating goes for her stuff from the 80's and early 90's.
