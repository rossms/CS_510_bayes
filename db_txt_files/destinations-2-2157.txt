oh china. im conflicted on you. first of all your government sucks major donkey nuts, what with the systematic destruction of tibetan culture and your more than prominent practice of slave labor (mainly for nike and various toy and textile compaines) and your willingness to accept the US's outsourced labor. but then you have beautiful 5,000 year old culture and amazing scenery. for now im going to have to stick with my much to be desired status.
