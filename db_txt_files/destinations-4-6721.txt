In terms of scenery, this state is gorgeous, with two absolutely beautiful national parks in the southern section (Bryce and Zion.) Salt Lake City is a pretty city as well. The biggest problem, as so many people have pointed out, is the politics. There's a certain sense of feeling unwelcome, as a visitor - especially in Salt Lake City - that is very disturbing.
