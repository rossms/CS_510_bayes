Good movie about the teens attending the High school of performing arts. the first part is around the characters trying out for the high school. it takes the talented teens through the four years of school there. There are a lot of talented young actors portraying the teens.It gives kind of a birds eye view of what it would be like to be a student at the high school of performing arts. the good with the bad.
