A great president. All the trash talkers should take a good look in their wallets and see what his successor has done. Yeah, that's right! Talk about role models, how about telling our youth that stealing elections and rigging ballot boxes (that means YOU Jeb and Catherine) are ok. I'll take Bill over that dolt we have now. Wait until YOU lose your job and YOUR son's start coming home in flag-draped coffins. So, why don't you all go kiss Rush's ass and do what he tells you like the good sheep that you are.
