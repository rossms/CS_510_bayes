I give Oliver Stone a lot of credit, both for his movies ( Platoon, Wall Street, The Doors, JFK, etc.) and for the fact that he's willing to make fun of himself (remember that cameo in the Kevin Kline movie Dave, where they cut to a news clip of Stone theorizing that there was a conspiracy to replace the President with a body double?).
