We thought this was a funny movie. Not the greatest movie I ever saw., but it did have great scenes.Robert DeNiro is terrific as the dad who intimidates, Ben Stillers character.I liked the scene at dinner time and the conversation that took place, the dad making the boyfriend take a lie detector test.A lot of good scenes. Ben stiller plays the boyfriend who is trying to get enough nerve to ask his girlfriends dad if he can marry her.Robert DeNiro is so good at playing the kind of character that can scare the H***out of someone. Not a perfect movie,but an enjoyable one.
