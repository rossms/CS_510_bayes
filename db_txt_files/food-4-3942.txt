I think taste-wise, I would prefer a few other snack foods over Rold Golds. However, when you begin to incorporate health aspects, pretzels are definitely the smart snack foods. And, RG pretzels are definitely the best. They are light with the perfect amount of salt. They also taste great when thrown on top of a bowl of vanilla ice cream (or frozen yogurt for you health-nuts).
