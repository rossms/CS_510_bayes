I think skoal should come out with a tasters six pack. instead of havin a sleeve of one flavour, they make a sleeve with six different flavours. Apple, Peach, Mint, spearmint, vanila, and a berry or cherry. I have been hearing somthing about a watermellon flavour....anyone knwo anythin about that ??
