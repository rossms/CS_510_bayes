I just got a Sprint PCS phone about a month ago and I like it. The best part is that you don't pay extra for long distance service. You pay a set fee and you get that many minutes of service whether it's local or long distance. Unfortunately, however, with digital, you are much more limited as to where you can be to make calls.
