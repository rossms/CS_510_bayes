I brought back a bottle of the 18 year old Appleton EXTRA and a bottle of the Appleton 21 Year Old. Let me tell you this stuff is phenomenal. I have yet to opent the 21 year old because I am saving it for a special occasion, however, the 18 year old EXTRA is outstanding and tastes similar to a fine cognac. The finish on the EXTRA lasts for a long long time - an hour or tow. no exaggeration
