I have a 2004 Jetta, and have been completely happy with it for the first 11,000 miles. I haven't encountered any of the maintenance problems that other people have, and it drives great. Mine's a stick, and it is a whole lot smoother than any other manual transmission I have driven. And I bought the base package, which was surprisingly much cheaper than the Civic, yet it comes with standard features that makes it feel like I paid for upgrades.
