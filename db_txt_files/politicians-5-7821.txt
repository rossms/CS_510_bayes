A great man who managed who still managed to become President. A rare occurrance. He was also a visionary. Not to mention a man who wasted not a second of his life and used his intellect and talents to the fullest. A family man to boot. Yes, a few of his positions I would question but all in all the American people got the most bang for their buck with this leader, author, enviormentalist, linguist, soldier, nobel prize winner, athlete, orator and cowboy.
