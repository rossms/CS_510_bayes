It all depends on which campus you attend. U-Mass Boston is really good but there is no housing. U-Mass Amhearst also really good but the local town (off campus)is very racist and it is a dry city, meaning no keg parties and hooch is limmited! All the other U-Mass's are under funded and are one step up from community college.
