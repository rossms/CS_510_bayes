The Western Bacon Cheesburger is my weapon of choice when visiting Carl's Jr., and I like the fact that they kept the old Hardee's breakfast menu. I will say that the sauce they put on their burgers is something you have to be in the mood for, so I am not a frequent Carl's Jr. customer. When I do go, the food has always been very good.
