Victoria's Secret IS a little overpriced but the clothes are very sexy and practical. Most ladies i see are wearing it, and that's why I myself went into the store. They are cute and comfortable, and come in a variety of sizes(the undies)! I've never tried bras, but i am sure if i wanted to, they would BE GREAT. Try it if you have some money...but even if you don't, IS there a place you can go to anymore for 2 for a dollar?
