Sam's Lager is fine stuff -- an exquisite compliment to unwinding at the end of the day, watching Seinfeld re-runs and eating take-out in front of the TV. If you're really going to taste your beer, my favorite is Sam's Cream Stout, but then its not good for summer drinking. The Lager is always appropriate.
