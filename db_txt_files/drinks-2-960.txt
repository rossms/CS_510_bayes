Watery and unexciting. I don't think I've ever bought a six pack of this and have no intention to either unless of course I'm hosting a bad beer night again, but it's getting harder and harder to convince people that that's a fun event. Everyone is so beer conscious these days they don't see the novelty in a bad beer extravaganza..shclitz, shaefer, mickey's, pbr, genesee, old mill...
