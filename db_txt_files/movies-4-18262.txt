 The Lost Boys is a very tongue-in-cheek look at both the vampire and teen angst genres. It's not quite a parody but still employs lots of semi-dark humor and some wickedly funny lines. The film has a very 80's feel but without getting stuck there and is really unique and fascinating enough to draw you in more than once and probably several times. Worth checking out if you enjoy an occasional laugh in the face of either of the two topics listed above.
