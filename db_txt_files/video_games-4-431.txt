I played this game right to left and left to right (and right to left was easier) until I ran out of time. I could never prove that the game is in a loop and you go back through the start. I wished there was a way to add more time as you played...I got every damn possible point I could get and no time...so what's then the point? for its time it was like visual crack replaced only by Pitfall 2 (but that game had flaws). The game had experinced me going down the pit on purpose to see how many times I can jump the scorpion before luck ran out.
