Don't they cook anything anymore? Doesn't seem like it, everything is pre-cooked and just warmed up. McNuggets are a now a very strange texture. Best item is still the french fries (when the oil is fresh, and the fries haven't sat around too long, and they are properly salted). Of the reheated sandwiches, the McRib is eatable (in small doses), and a double Big Mac still reminds me a little of the old days.
