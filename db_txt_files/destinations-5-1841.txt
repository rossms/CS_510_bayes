If the US is so bad why do people swim, crawl, beg, steal, plead, and otherwise do anything possible to get here? I for one am sick of apologizing for the things we do and our past. America's a great country and anyone having a problem with that can kiss our red, white, and blue behinds... (except France.. who knows where their lips have been)
