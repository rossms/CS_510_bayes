I was rather skeptical of this restaurant when I first heard of it - throw your peanut shells on the floor?? - but was pleasantly surprised after my first visit there. Not only is the good great, but the waiters are polite, friendly and patient, and the atmosphere is like a nothing else. While it's not a place I'd want to eat at EVERY day, it's always a good experience.
