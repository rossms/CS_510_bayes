I'm not an Errol Flynn fan. I agree with CastleBee, from what I've read about him he was rather an arrogant jerk. I give him 2 stars because I liked him in the movie Gentleman Jim about the boxer Jim Corbett, the first heavy-weight champion of the world. The character of Jim is very lively and Flynn actually does a good job bringing him to life. The movie has some good character actors- Alan Hale, Ward Bond, Jack Carson and William Frawley. I could also watch The Adventure's of Robin Hood, but not for Errol Flynn, I'd watch it for Claude Rains.
