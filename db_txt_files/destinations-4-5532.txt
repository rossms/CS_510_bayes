New Hampshire is a good state- politics are a wee conservative for New England, but it is changing and becoming more open and liberal. Nice towns and small cities that offer a high quality of life. Winters upstate are a wee harsh, however. People tend to be a wee cold and reserved, but genuine and 'up front' with you, which is generally what you find in most of New England. Lots of 'outdoor' things to do. Great food and resorts. Some decent beaches on the short shore of the Atlantic.
