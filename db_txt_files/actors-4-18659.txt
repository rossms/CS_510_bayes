I agree with Ruby... Calling Zemeckis great isn't quite appropriate, but he's made some extremely likable films over the years. Romancing the Stone was entertaining, as was Back to the Future. And I really enjoyed Forrest Gump, despite the fact that people seemed to get a little carried away with it. Cast Away was a little bit of a disappointment, especially the ending, but I can understand the argument that the film had to end in that ambiguous way. I don't think anyone would ever describe Zemeckis as edgy, but he makes good movies.
