He was the first truly great movie comedian. He had a style that none of his many imitators could quite capture. He was multi-talented. He directed and even wrote the musical scores for many of his films! My favorite movies of his are The Kid (1921) City Lights (1931) and any of the films he was in with Mabel Normand.
