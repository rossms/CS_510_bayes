Compared to everyone else i may seem like an odd rating, but this movie was nothing special and was soooo weird and boring! It was hard to follow the story and even though it was funny, I still found it to be based on nothing and had no point. All-in-all I thought it was a waste of time to watch it, totally absurd and stupid, but not even a funny stupid (like J.Carey) just silly. ONe of Clooney's worst films ever.
