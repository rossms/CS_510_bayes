I got an 01.The car is OK, but Toyota service and sales is terrible! I wanted a rook rack and was told they would not be available for 6 months and if I wanted one now it would be 2000 dollars! Felt like I was decieved and Toyota does nothing to alleviate the problem. Good car, but shoddy job supporting it.
