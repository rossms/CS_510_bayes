I discovered E.R. about 6 months ago and am amazed at its sweet vinilla overtones. Simple and delicsious because of its smooth finish. The pallet changes lightly through out and never is never boring. One cube and a few minutes to mellow will reward you with a nose full of fragrences and flavors. I have turned all my friends to it. Even one that is a dedicated scotch drinker appreciates this treat!
