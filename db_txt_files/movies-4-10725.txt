I am so upset to see Dodgeball got such a low rating. . .c'mon guys! Give it a chance! Dont let dodgeball live in the shadows of Anchorman! I for one, thought dodgeball was great (and will be even better on DVD). Vince Vaughn managed to pull off the 'nice guy' role pretty well and Stiller's character was as ridiculous as ever! Plus I loved all of the cameos, and lets not forget the water skiing squirrel (also seen in Anchorman). And for the record, if ESPN 8 'THE OCHO' were real, I probably would not mind watching that sports center!
