I read I, Robot because I heard they were making a movie about it, and the summary of plot I read sounded really good. I thought the ethics of murder by a robot would be something interesting to think about, but that storyline was nothing at all like the plot of the book. I was sorely disappointed, although I did like the first story, and then the ones about the robot cult on Venus (?) and the mind-reading robot. The last story was one of the worst ones ever, though.
