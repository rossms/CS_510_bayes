If you ever wondered what happened to all the money you spend on those overpriced Hallmark cards, look no further. This is where the cash comes home to roost -- and it is an impressive hotel/shopping/dining/residential multi-block complex of buildings in the heart of the Kansas City and, being Hallmark, everything is rendered very tastefully. If I were a Kansas Citian, this is where I would want to live.
