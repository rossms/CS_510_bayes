One of their better albums with classic cuts like "Ripple," "Box of Rain," "Truckin,'" and "Sugar Magnolia." On this album, and the predecessor "Workingman's Dead," they pretty much gave up on the psychedelia and endless jamming in favor of rootsy, country and folk inflected tunes that owed a debt to acts like The Band, Creedence, and C,S,N&Y. The results were more commercially successful and artistically more significant than their prior material was.
