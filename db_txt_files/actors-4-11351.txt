I think she is beautiful and a good actress. I've liked most of the movies I've seen her in; however, she does tend to be a little full of herself. She's intelligent, yes, but she seems to eager to fluant her intelligence instead of wearing it gracefully. If she can outgrow this, onscreen and off, I'll enjoy her work alot more.
