I consider this a great alternative to having a sugary soda, when I get home after a long day at work and feel like drinking something other than water. Its taste is smooth and a little rich, with almost no bitterness and a slight tangy flavor that might be the lemongrass. It's got decent thirst quenching capacity, and has a flavor compatible with a wide range of foods. Highly Recommended!
