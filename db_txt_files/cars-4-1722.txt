I own a '98 with a little over 40,000 on it. The car has perform very well, have not had it in the shop once other than recalls. Sorry to see the line end, have always like Olds. Was thinking of upgrading to the Aurora. Now GM has lost another customer to the foreign market. Way to go GM. Bring back the Olds line with another quilty car & you could win me back. You had a winner an let it go.
