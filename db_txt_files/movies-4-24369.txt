Now entering the ring from..... oh sorry!?! Roddy Piper as an actor.... hmmmm.... Actualy a good move for this film. Carpenter must have known that before he started. The script is tight, the casting worked well, I love Meg Foster!, and overall the movie clicked even with cut-rate effects. Worth a watch.
