This past summer we spent 12 days in Wichita and fell in love with the place, especially the Old Town area. This city is a undiscovered treasure, with much to see and do. It is not to big and not to small, with much western heritage. The Hotel at Old Town is a Four Star / Diamond facility, try it out and fall in love with this special place.
