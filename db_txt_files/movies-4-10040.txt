In my book, Adam Sandler's best movie to date. He truly emerged as a star in my view in this film, as it was probably the most serious film that he has done. I'm sure that many people can relate to his character (the slacker named Sonny), who is unexpectadely handed the responsibility of taking care of a kid. The antics of Julian are truly hysterical. Kudos to Adam Sandler!
