I have T-Mobile for about a year now. Quite satisfied with service. You can't beat no roaming coast-to-coast, web-based account service and coverage. Sometimes, of course, you get a dropped call or two but, whoever suggests that other services has no such occasions, better watch his nose, it is begining to grow. I find this operator VERY satisfying.
