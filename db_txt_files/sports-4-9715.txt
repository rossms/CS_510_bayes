I have to say the sixers are a great team, and I know during the playoffs everyone seemed to fall in love with Al. But the Sixers probably won't win a championship to soon, but they will probably always win the east for the next few years, but to win it all, they're going to have to get another player to help out Al when he's not on his game, man, they never should of gotten rid of Stackhouse.
