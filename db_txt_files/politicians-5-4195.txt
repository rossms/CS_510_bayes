Today, in the aftermath of the election, I am still firmly in Nader's camp. If he cost Gore the election, that's firmly on Gore's shoulders. Gore killed himself with a weak stance on progressive issues and an apparent disrespect for the people of America with his constant lying. It's time for the Democrats to take a long, hard look at themselves in the mirror, and scrutinize their plutocratic presidential candidates like Clinton and Gore. As the world gets warmer and America's corporate overlords squeeze the nation tighter and tighter we will gain more support. Hopefully, it won't be too late.
