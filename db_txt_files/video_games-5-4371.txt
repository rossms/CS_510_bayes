Finally tossed my Starcraft game disks in the dumpster, and erased the game from my hard drive. Not because it sucked, but because it had consumed nearly three years of my life. Starcraft is the Chess of the modern era. And it is the one thing in this world that the Koreans totally dominate. Starcraft players in S. Korea (even if they aren't Korean) can achieve fame and wealth if they are gosu (great) gamers.
