Don't Get Me Wrong, I LOVE the red sox! I am there BIGGEST FRIEKIN' FAN!!! But Nomar tries to dominate, he screws up in important situations and Frankly , his teammates don't like him! I have met Ortiz, Mueller, Timlin,Jones, Ramirez and Kim, and NONE OF THEM LIKE HIM! Please! nomore nomar! I admit he has talent but USE IT!!!!
