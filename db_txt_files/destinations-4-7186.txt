My expectations were pretty high when I visited Venice, so high it would have been very difficult for the city to live up to them. Also, I was there with a college friend instead of a girlfriend, so it may not have been the ideal situation. But I spent three days there, and wished I'd left after two. Tourists everywhere, expensive food, expensive hotels, and some not-so-great smells floating around. Still, the city is beautiful and unique, and I really enjoyed walking around some of the thin corridors through the residential parts of the city.
