The most creative, imaginative, thoughtful book I've found. Robert Stanek gives you great insight into the people, places and things in his world. The world is called Ruin Mist. I had this instant connection with Adrina. That's never happened to me in any book I've read. She has very real pain and it drives a lot of her actions. I also like Vilmos, Seth, Galan and Emel. These new friends come off the page. They all have unique personalities and aspirations. I enjoyed this book a lot. I think you will too.
