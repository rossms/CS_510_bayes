I was just wondering if the rumors that Johnathan Taylor Thomas is gay are true. He certainly seems to be gay in my opinion. After all, he did star in a few gay-oriented films and he did a good job portraying a gay teenager in them. Of course, he knows all about the way a gay teenager acts from his own life experiences.
