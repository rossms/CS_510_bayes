I don't understand why people don't like GC. I am a first-year student here and I love it. I can't imagine being anywhere else. The academics are great, sports are a little bit of added fun, everyone is friendly, and the food is delicious. How many other schools serve foods like mussels and crabs? Some do, but not many. GC deserves a much higher rating, but hey, at least I know I'm right.
