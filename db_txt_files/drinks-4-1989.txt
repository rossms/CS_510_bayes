A delightfully sweetened green tea that's sweet enough to take on the big mass market iced teas, yet still tastes enough like real green tea that it should satisfy most purists. Much more appealing than their Community Green, IMO. In short: sweet & refreshing, with just a touch of bitterness. 1/4th the caffeine of coffee. Cane sugar & honey give it 68 calories per 15.5 oz. (plastic!) bottle.
