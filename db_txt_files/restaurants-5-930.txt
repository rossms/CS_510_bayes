This is probably my favorite fast food chain. It's actually a pretty healthy meal. I used to work there, and here's a clue for all you people coming in and saying that you're starting a new diet: If you cover your sandwich with cheese, mayo, and oil, you aren't starting a diet. Also, I'm seeing this place getting a lower rating because it's being compared with shops that are, most times, more expensive and NOT fast food chains.
