I have been riding motorcycles for twenty years. This is the first harley I have owned (FXDWG 2003). The wide glide is great to look at, and even better to ride. The fit and finish is as good as the metric bikes I have owned. The realy big differnce is the ride, you will love putting alot of miles on this bike. By the way I get alot more looks on a HD.
