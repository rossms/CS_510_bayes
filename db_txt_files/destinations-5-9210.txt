I love the church, even though it is still incomplete. Guadi's work adds sooo much character to the city. His work is so full of detail that one never gets bored looking at it. From far it may appear like a melted sand castle, but once up close, the time spent to detail is amazing. Views of the city from the tower is great as well.
