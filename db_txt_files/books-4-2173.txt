It seems like the cartoonists will *never* run out of jokes. Such is the nature of parenting the very young. The kids do age, though not quite in sync with our time. As a result, we become emotionally attached to them and continue to laugh at their cute little ways. The parents, Wanda and Darryl, make some frustrating mistakes, which I'm sure will make the frustrated parental readers feel better. I wonder how long they can keep this up? One warning: babies do get pretty gross sometimes.
