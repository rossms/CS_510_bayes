As you will see in my comments of Detroit Metro, I used to really hate going somewhere on Northwest. I used to hope that I could get a flight into Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky on one of the Delta subsidiaries, or on US Airways to Pittsburgh, but Detroit revamped their airport, so Northwest became a lot better in my mind then.
