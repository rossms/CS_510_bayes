Serves some of the best steak I have ever had. The T-bone was excellent, cooked just the way I liked it. Great service. Everyone is freindly, from the hostess right down to the busboys who clean the table after you eat. I can highly recomend this resturant. A bit if a wait, but that only prooves how popular this place is, and rightfully so. The prices are moderate and the food is excellent.
