This cereal is fun to eat, no matter how old you are. It's colorful and tastes good.When I was younger I used to eat it plain and save all the marshmallows for last. That seems to be the most popular way to consume it on this board. I'll admit, it doesnt contain sugar and there are more nutritous cereals out there, but those arent as much fun to wake up to in the morning. Lucky Charms Rule!
