This year's victories over Penn State and Michigan were very impressive for one of the bright spots in the sagging PAC-10. The Bruins' victories proved they were a force to be reckoned with this year. Despite the loss of greats such as Skip Hicks and Danny Farmer, the Bruins look toward a stellar year and rebirth under the leadership of Danny Farmer and Ryan Mcaan. I expect big things from the Bruins, and hope they make it to the Rose Bowl.
