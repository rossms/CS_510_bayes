Jolly Ranchers have to be, no doubt about it, the ultimate hard candy. One thing that bothered me, however is Frank15's comment that all the flavors, except grape, are EXELLENT! I don't see how anyone could not like the grape flavored Jolly Ranchers. In my opinion, the grape ones are one of the best flavors. Oh, and the teeth sticking together thing, just don't bite them! I mean seeing as how they are so great, you should really savor the flavor and suck on them untill they are just a memory of delicious flavor and excitement. Enough said.
