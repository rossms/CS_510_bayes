star wars games mostly dont fall with the main story but this one has a story of its own! i very well enjoyed this game and i would surly say this is a fun game! you can choose what force powers you want to use witch is really awsome! most of all why i liked this game was the characters ive never played such a game where you can really feel as the characters are there and just them makes you not want to put the game down ever! if you really have played and liked most star wars games this is one you sould think about truly COOL!
