Our family just bought the Jeep Liberty Renegade, which is just superb! We had to special order it from the factory because it was extremely difficult to find one with manual transmission. If you are looking for a beautiful vehicle with the soul of a true jeep, get it! I'm tellin' ya, you won't be disappointed!!
