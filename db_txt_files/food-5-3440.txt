I love pizza! So for me, when it s just not possible to get out and visit my local pizzeria, then I head for the oven. Red Barron Pizza s get two thumbs up from me when it comes to frozen pizza. Not that frozen pizza s are usually anything to get excited about, but the three cheeses version of the Red Barron Pizza is a great substitute for going out when that pizza craving hits.
