A one dimensional actress with, well there is no other nice way to say this, creepy looks. Her acting is cold, and she comes across as a stuck up person. What a dissappointment to find her starring in the television series of BUFFY, when the movie was so much better. Kristy Swanson is better looking, more talented, and would have been a better choice to bnring the role she created to televison.
