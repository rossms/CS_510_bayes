I got stood up by 2 different companies for my move. I was moving on a Tuesday, so my friends all had convenient excuses. I called these guys on Monday afternoon as a last ditch effort to help - they had 3 guys there the next morning at 8am and they had the job done in 3 hours (one house to another across town) for $399. The movers who stood me up were all quoting $500+. Mark in their customer support center took great care of me! 2 thumbs way up!
