Although it wasn't as good as generations, it was still interesting. The only problem with Star Trek now is there theme is getting a bit boring. When ever they can't think of a good episode to write, they just put the Borg in. Data was funny how he beat the borgs, Picard was his usual good self. But Counsellor Dianna Troy was a let down. She was acting like one of those pub bimbos rather then this respectable Command Officer. At times, it did get a bit boring.
