I like this album because of the good bass melodies. The guitar is usually overpowering in rock songs, but in this album the guitar sounds like the support of the bass. I also like the harmony of the bass and guitar, like in Californication, Scar Tissue, and Otherside. Sometimes I can get annoyed by how many times he sings about California though.
