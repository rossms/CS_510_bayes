As a fan of x-men for 15 years I know a lot of the original story lines and find that the movie is lacking. They changed alot of stuff, like Rouge coming to the professor as a teen. But being a new generation and a new spin on the show I still loved it. I thought Hugh did a good job as Wolverine, and I liked the desention between him and Cyclops. But they didn't show enough of the crap between him and Jean. I hope next time they show Beast and Gambit.
