I'm so proud of our Jim Jeffords. Proud that he finally came to his senses and switched parties. He's a loyal Democrat now, and I think we should all give him a sincere pat on the back. Only reason he gets a four and not a five from me was that I don't know much about his political career as a Republican. And I know some of you will call him a traitor or a hypocrite or something, but he is one politician that I feel I can trust. To quote a song: Be gone with you, you shod and shady senators! Move the heck over and let this good one in!
