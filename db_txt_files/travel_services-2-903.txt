penske truck rental did an ok job with the truck, but the directed me to moving help from moving staffers. this company shafted me. didn't stick up for me when their local mover broke my things and overcharged me. they at first told me that it was not their issue and that it was between me and the provider once i booked my move. now they won't even return my calls. very poor customer service. i am goin to charge back my card but consumers beware of moving staffers
