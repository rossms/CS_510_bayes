I have loved Life Savers my whole life. Sadly though, some of my favorite flavors have gone the way of the dodo. My all-time favorite was the tangerine and when I was really young I loved the lime ones. I do like the newly revised selection in the assorted rolls but I would really like to be able to get full rolls of pineapple but in the meantime I will have to make do with rolls of the wild cherry. (And I am never without a roll in my car to help stave off starvation and keep my car from turning into a fast food joint.)
