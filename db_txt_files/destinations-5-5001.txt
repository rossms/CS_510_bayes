Old fishing villages, sea breezes, lighthouses, home of Stephen King and the Collins family of Dark Shadows fame - what's not to like? Seriously, I have never been to Maine but I am very intrigued by this very woodsy northeastern state by the sea. It just has a kind of romantic old charm that has been calling me for a long time. I hope to take a trip there soon.
