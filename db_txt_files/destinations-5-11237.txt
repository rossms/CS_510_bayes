Bar Harbor is beautiful in October. Don't go much later than the 2nd week as things start to slow down. The leaves are awesome. There's plenty to do. Acadia National park is right next door, Cadillac Mountain is majestic, and of course the waterfront is goregous. If you're looking for some great food, check out South West Harbor, a restaurant called Dry Dock is fantastic, a real unexpected treat. The Oceanarium is also a fun place to visit, great for kids and a good way to find out about the lobster industry.
