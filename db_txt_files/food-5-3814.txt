Muir Glen offers tomato products made from organically grown tomatoes! Their ketchup is the best I've ever had. I pay too much for it at my local market, but Wild Oats often has it on special. Their canned tomaotes and paste are delicious. That said, the pasta sauce isn't my favorite, but on the merits of their other products I still gave it five stars. They earned that just by being organic and affordable. Besides, the company is named for John Muir. What's not to love?
