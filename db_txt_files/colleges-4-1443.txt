FSU vs. UF has to be the stupidest college rivalry in the country. I can't think of two schools with more in common than these student factories. As an out-of-state student who has done coursework at both, here is my opinion: You can get a solid education at either school, but FSU students tend to be more interesting people. There are more artists, musicians, etc., at FSU, and UF kids tend to be full of themselves.
