I HAVE never, ever been delinquent in payment... but their credit department keeps making mistakes OR SOMETHING?? I have tried to pay with checks 3, yes 3, times for the same payment. All my checks to other people are fine, but they say it's a problem with MY BANK??! Uh, NO! And, yes the late charges are piling up for NO REASON== this is the worst experience ever.
