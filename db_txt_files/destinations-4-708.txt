Not colonial, like Antigua Guatemala, but quaint if you really want to know the country. Good people, skilled pick pockets. Get coffee and tortillas with cream at Nuestra Tierra accross from the artisan market. If you spend the night, ask your taxi driver to take you to "el Tobogan" a dance club near "el Pueblo". Watch the locals and some international famosos, and try to salsa and merengue yourself. Live music friday and saturday nights.
