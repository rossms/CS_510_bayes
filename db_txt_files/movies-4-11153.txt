i think this film was realy good! i never thought beyonce would be such a good actress,she is a very talented woman and i respect her.austin powers has always been funny,but i would say this one is alot better than the other two! it is funny but in parts its kind of sad.me and my friends realy enjoyed this,so i went and bought it on dvd, it was well worth it because you can watch it over and over again with out getting board of it! definately one to watch!!!!!
