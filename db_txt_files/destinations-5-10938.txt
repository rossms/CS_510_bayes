If you're in the LA region and you've never been before you've gotta go to Disneyland, I don't care how old you are. I went when I was about 18 and even though I hate crowds, and that's one thing you're sure to experience, I still had a great time. I don't know that I'd go back again and again but it's just such a wacked out place with so much going on it's almost worth going just for the people watching. Not to mention that they've got some great rides there as well.
