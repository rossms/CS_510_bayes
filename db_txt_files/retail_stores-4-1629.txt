Sears certainly has a stigma attached to it no doubt. Unfortunately, all I've ever bought at Sears are some tools and tires so I can't give an opinion on the rest of the store but for both of those items Sears was excellent. Can't beat well known trusted tools that are guaranteed for life and tires..well in my opinion for the kind of driving I do tires are tires all that really matters to me with them is that they're decently priced and possibly guaranteed. I once bought tires there that soon after had the sidewall blow out and they replaced them with no hassles, easey, peasey Japanesey.
