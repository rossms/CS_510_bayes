Not the best Feature Back for Washington, but good enough. He's fast, tough and a very good Pro RB. Not really a good NFC East RB though. He's not the guy who pounds on defenders and wears down defenses. He should be traded to Oakland for LaMont Jordan. Jordan would be a great Redskin ( former UMD Terp) while Portis would be a great Raider. Portis is a flake too. He dresses up in wacky outfits for press conferences.
