I don't usually like cowboys, but Vince made my whole opinion on that do a complete turn around when i first saw him in Clay Pigeons. I have seen every movies he has been in, and i admit, i really enjoy his presence. He is a very sexy man, but he has a boyish charm and goofiness to him that is nice too.
