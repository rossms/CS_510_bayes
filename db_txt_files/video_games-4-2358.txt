I'm not one for fighting games but this one had just enough twists in it to get my attention. Graphics and music are quite good. When playing solo, you don't always have a single target to fight. Some fights contain gangs of characters. Sometimes you are even given a partner to help you out too. There is a good selection of characters to play as plus the opportunity to get some secret ones.
