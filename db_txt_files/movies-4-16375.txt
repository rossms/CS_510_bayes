A pretty good movie. I did not think it was as good as I thought it would be. The actors are all good. Haley Joel Osment as the boy who wants to do as his teacher suggests and do kindnesses for others.The movie has good moments but it really does not have the feel good nature that I thought it would . The ending is too sad. And some of the characters were boring.
