When this song came out, I had to buy the cd. I had their old cd, Sunburn, and I have to say that Fuel is a great band. Not heavy, but very melodic. This guy's voice (Brett) is amazing. This song is so touching. I love this song. I didn't really like the video...I owuld give it a 3...but this song is amazing!!! Definetly one of the best from them!
