I don't really care for any kind of microwave popcorn because it never cooks right. What little I do get out of the bag has a nice flavor, but most of the time I am stuck with at least a couple of hundred unpopped kernels. We've had a couple of different microwaves, and neither one has been able to cook this stuff right.
