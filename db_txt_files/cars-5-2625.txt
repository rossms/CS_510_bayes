All time favorite car! Looks and style wise is very exotic, yet its a car you can drive to work everyday unlike some of its competitors. The sound of the engine will not help your police record mind you. Handling is just amazing, hugs the road yet its not as stiff as you might think. Power wise, it def. doesn't have as much as other exotics (something that it gets knocked for allot) but having driven in a few it sure was some serious power. Keep in mind the weight to power ratio. Its a pricey one, but seems to be holding its value.
