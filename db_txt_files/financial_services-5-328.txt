I dont know what these guys are talking about but I really recommend this card to first time card users, Capital One was the first to give me a chance and give me a card when the other companies denied me. Now i have excellant credit with over 4 credit limit increases since i got the card. Customer service is great, easy to read online statements, i have more than enough time to pay off my balance, and i feel extremely secure with this card, i have not had a single problem and i am completely satisfied.
