I haven't had much of a problem with it, except that the Paperclip guy is really annoying. Even if you hide him he'll still try to tell you that you're doing it wrong by popping up a light bulb on the standard toolbar. Microsoft needs to make their software less annoying and more user-friendly. The other issue I have is when it tells you that you have a grammar mistake and it tells you the rule, and the rule is exactly the same thing as the mistake. Their grammar help is confusing at best.
