This is a really fun album to listen to. It has a hard sort of sound, but you can dance to it. Most hard music you can't really dance to, but this one you can. My favorite song is Sleep Now in the Fire . This album is a tribute to the janitor's strike in Los Angeles. Rage helped them out and they won. So, it's a good album and has a certain type of meaning.
