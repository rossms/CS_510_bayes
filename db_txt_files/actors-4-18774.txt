Most independent directors are vastly overrated (not that the tripe Hollywood produces nowadays is any better). But Jarmusch is a director who lives up to the hype. His movies are funny, original and 'weird in a good way'. Hasn't done much of note since the early 90s, so I'm dropping down him a star.
