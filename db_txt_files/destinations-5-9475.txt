The Duomo is one of the worst visible buildings of Florence. It's elaborate gates showing Biblical scenes is awesome and entering the ball, one feels as if they are going back in time, witnessing not only figures of history but the work of outstanding artists. Too bad that the air pollution is taking its toll on the marble covering but hopefully preservation will prevail.
