Have owned a Chevy Tahoe Z71 for one year. I absolutely love this truck. We tried every SUV out there and this was the most comfortable, easy driving vehicle we tried. We travel a lot and on the highway it just about drives itself. It turns on a dime and is easier to park then my minivan. I highly recommend getting the Z71 version over the regular Tahoe.
