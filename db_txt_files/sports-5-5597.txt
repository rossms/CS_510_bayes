Possibly the greatest offensive player to ever play in Chapel Hill (at the college level). Definitely the best offensive player in the country currently. He is misunderstood, but that is okay. Haters do understand that their favorite players can't hold a candle to him, and that's all they need to understand. Oh, I have a menacing look on my face, do I? Oh, I said this and this, huh? Well, guess what, I just dropped 30 on your team's head. Catch my drift?
