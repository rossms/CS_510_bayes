I like Johnny Depp and most of his movies. As far as his views of the United States, some would criticize his comments and his politics but obviously movies stars live in a different reality and perspective than most of us hard working middle classed people do. I don't judge people and the comments they make until I learn more of the perspective of life that they have grown up with and developed as a result of their surroundings and lifestyle.
