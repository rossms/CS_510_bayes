Still a quality guy and moving over to the NL should help. Obviously he got the ball over the plate too much in 04 giving up 26 HRs (25 combined the 3 previous seasons) nearly 200 hits (less than 150 each of the last 3 seasons) 3.90 ERA was not a good year no matter who you are. Still, can't argue with 227 Ks.
