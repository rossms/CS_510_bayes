It is less-informed Americans such as Mr. Reilly who are responsible for the stereotype that all Americans are stupid. Most Americans do speak English today, but as you un-inentionally pointed out, are very prone to typos. I'm curious through as to why you gave him 5-stars. Then again, everyone is entitled to their own opinions...in most countries that is. Anyways, George III did rule for an astounding 6 decades, and like today's prime minister, had some great difficulty in foreign affairs. Although history seems to remember him for more of a madman than a king.
