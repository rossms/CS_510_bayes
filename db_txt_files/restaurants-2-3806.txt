well i agree with alot of people i too have stood for hrs and get no break... (they tell me to open my mouth and ask?) hmm thats management for ya...i have worked there for over a year and they have had maybe 8 or more mangers... they cut hrs send ya home early but when the college kids come home for holiday breaks they get hrs! and i have been called not so nice things by managers who don't know how to treat there employee's...
