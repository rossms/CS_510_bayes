Good movie about a man whose entire life has been a TV show and he is unaware of it. when he gets to be about 30 odd things start to happen like a stage light falling from the ground, and the radio goes off station and he can hear someone describing where he is driving. He slowly starts to realize that things just are not as he thought. by the end he finds out his whole life was a tv show and he gets the chance to decide if he wants to stay or go. Jim Carrey did a good Job as Truman the man whose whole life had been a lie.I especially liked how this movie ends.
