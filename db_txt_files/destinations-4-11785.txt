More hype than what I saw. I would love to go behind the exhibits that were "closed" but couldn't. What I was able to see put it on parr with a good zoo but certainly not the great zoo that I was expecting. The things that they were doing in the closed area maybe is what makes San Diego great and is something my children will appreciate it. I put it at OK.
