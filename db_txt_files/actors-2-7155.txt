I don't agree with his politics, I don't really like his acting and I don't really find much of him worthy paying attention to. However, when he went on the O'Reilly Factor, I was expecting to see a bomb throwing, radical left winger who didn't know a thing about politics. He actually expressed himself pretty well and didn't bash Bush as much as his counterparts have in Hollywood.
