This film is quite bad. I found it a bit boring at times, but the chemistry between Jackie Chan and Chris Tucker was very good. Made simply for people between the ages of 9 and 13, Rush Hour is a stupid movie with not much of a story, mostly witless dialogue and flat direction. Rush Hour 2 was far superior, but never mind. Certainly not a must-see. Summary: A BAD MOVIE WITH BAD DIALOGUE, NOT MUCH STORY AND FLAT DIRECTION. GOOD CHEMISTRY BETWEEN J.C AND C.T.
