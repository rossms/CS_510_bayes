I'm not saying she's a bad person but i really see thru her. Everything she claims to be and represent she is not. She's a mediocre actress getting by on her cute funky girl persona, but with age that is wearing thin. She is not so young or cute anymore. Face it Drew, you're lucky to be here. So is the equally mediocre airhead cast of Charlies Angels.
