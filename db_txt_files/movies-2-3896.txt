As well as this movie is made, I have to give it a poor rating for being racist. At first glance we see a kingdom of good versus an empire of evil, but at closer inspection there is a white suburban elitist theme here, with the good characters sounding a bit like the Beaver and the villains voiced with inner city black dialect. I despise any kind of political correctness, but this is one film that is just too obvious with its subtext.
