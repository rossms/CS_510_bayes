One of my favorite Hitchcock flicks, Rear Window is about a man with a broken leg in one room, with one window only, doing one thing. The amazing thing about it is that despite the fact there's an obvious lack of action, Hitchcock makes it feel as though the action never stops. Great suspense. Jimmy Stewart was much better than Christopher Reeves.
