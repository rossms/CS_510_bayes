For a children's cartoon based on a biblical story, this is really quite good. The voice overs were terrific as was the animation by Dreamworks. The score by Hans Zimmer was also fantastic. It smudged on the biblical storyline but it keeps the true theme without becoming preachy. Fun for the whole family.
