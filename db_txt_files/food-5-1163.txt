If I made a list of the Top Ten Most Highly Addictive Foods, peanut M M's would rank number one. I find their delectable, salty/sweet taste irresistible, and there's something about their bright, shiny colors that's really appealing. I could eat peanut M M's non-stop and never tire of them. For that reason, I don't allow myself to buy anything larger than the individual-serving package. I cannot be trusted around peanut M M's!
