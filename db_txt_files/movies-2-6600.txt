Alan Ladd must have been Kevin Costner's predecessor (by about 30 years) as the most mind-numbingly boring actor in Hollywood. This movie sums up and reflects everything about his acting for me. It is so sleepy and so not what I want to sacrifice even a couple of hours of my life watching. Proving that one person s classic is just another person s ticket to dreamland.
