Tea anywhere. That s what you have when you buy this wonderful tea. From time to time when I m rushing about doing errands or on a bit of a vacation, I love to reach for one of these out of the cooler instead of the usual soft drink. This tea has a nice tea flavor, but it isn t over bearing as some of these types of drinks are. It has a nice balance between the tea and sweetener. It s a great drink.
