Intelligent, leggy blonde actress best known for being the only good element in several mediocre films(The Truman Show, Congo, The Mothman Prophecies). SHe really showed her stuff in House of Mirth and You Can Count on Me, and the MooCow can always cownt on Ms. Linney to light up th screen with her skills as well as her face. Don't be surprised if this capable young actress wins an Oscar very soon.
