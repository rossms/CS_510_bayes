a walk is like a triple ...henderson in his prime would be the leadoff hitter on ANY all time team, NO leadoff hitter ( rose, and cobb included) had anywhere near the combonation of speed and power, rickey tired more pitchers by 1 looking at the most pitches 2 taking walks 3 drove the catcher to distraction while worried about the SB, henderson made everyone hitting behind twice as good when he was on base...which was at a career .400 clip
