 Spy Game is worth seeing in the theater. It's a fast-paced, engrossing action/thriller starring Robert Redford and Brad Pitt. Redford is retiring from the CIA when Pitt, a fellow agent, gets into some serious trouble. The movie revolves around Redford's efforts to help his old friend out of a sticky situation. The plot is action-packed, and it moves along at a brisk pace. It was an added bonus to watch both Redford and Pitt on the big screen. If you like action and excitement, don't miss this one.
