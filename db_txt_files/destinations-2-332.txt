If I owned Ontario and Hell, I'd rent out Ontario and live in Hell. There are actually two Ontarios, one in the north and one in the south. Geologically, politically and socially they are no more alike than Greenich Village and Biloxi, Mississipi. As far as I'm concerned, a volcanic eruption would improve Toronto and environs no end. The north can be majestic, particularly around the shores of Lake Superior.
