Quite fun, even though Vice City and San Andreas are also out. GTA3 started the whole buzz on open-world games, and you can see why. It may not be as big as San Andreas, but I prefer that. It's just big enough. San Andreas, it's huge to the point you never can remember quite where to go, but GTA3, just right. I memorized every location and every street in the game, which made me feel like I WAS Tommy, and had been fighting to stay alive myself. No GTA game beats the city and setting.
