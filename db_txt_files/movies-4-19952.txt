Ok, so it was predictable, it was as they all seem to think, a typical slasher movie, granted, but it was definitely thrilling to watch. It was fast paced, good solid acting, and exciting. The hick inbred family of serial killers has been done before, but I believe this to be one of the best of those type movies. No, it's not texas chainsaw massacre, but it is also not meant to be. For one, It wasn't based on a true story. I think if you like this type of movie, you will enjoy this one.
