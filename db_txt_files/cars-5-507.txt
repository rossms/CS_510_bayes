Today I dusted a Yamaha sport bike with my 2002 Dyna FXD. Granted, my bike is slightly modified for racing, but the Yamaha should have had a 300 Lbs weight to thrust advantage over the FXD. He had me on the curves at about 120 mph with a nice groove line and lean angle but I dusted him on the straight. When was the last time you made 620+ pounds of cruiser motorcycle perform like a sport bike. Cruiser-HD-Yama-Saki, who cares. Its not the bike, its the rider.
