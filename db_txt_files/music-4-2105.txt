I think that DMB is one of greatest bands these days, meaning the the musicians on this album are amazing, not just Dave. If anything, Dave is the least talented musician !! this album is all about the dynamics between musicians, and it works perfectly. the songs aren't as strong as ,say, Finley Quaye's new album, but they are really strong. AN album worth buying.
