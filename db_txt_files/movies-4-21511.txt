In comparison to the previous two episodes, and for the last maybe hour or so of the movie, I give it 4 stars. I thought the last portion of the film was very powerful and I was definately moved by it. Granted I'm not a difficult person to be moved by a movie, but I still think it held up. Hayden improved his acting a bit, enough to make him at least bareable as compared with Episode II, but Natalie just seems stiff and unemotional, as she had throughout her reign which is a shame because she performs so well in other films. Overall, however, I did enjoy the movie, and I'd probably see it again.
