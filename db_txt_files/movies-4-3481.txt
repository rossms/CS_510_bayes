James Bond movies are exciting, especially the newer ones. Pierce Brosnan's second movie as Agent 007 is better than GoldenEye, because he does more action and he actually kissed Teri Hatcher. Still, I think he is good for playing the role of James Bond, and the action was more thrilling than GoldenEye. Plus, he kisses a cute Chinese girl.
