One of the great athletes of the 20th. century. And, a working man. Johnny U. is the epitome of what a professional athete should stand for. The man is a real Meansch (all round great guy!). Still lives and leads a productive life in his adopted home town of Baltimore. Johnny U. is our number one Raven's fan. Long live Johnny U!
