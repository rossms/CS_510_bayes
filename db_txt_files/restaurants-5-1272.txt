Arby's is another superb restuarant chain. This one has awesome chicken fingers, great curly fries, high-quality sauces, well-mixed fountain drinks and more. Service is great and even though prices are slightly higher than something like McDonalds, it's worth the extra dollar. Only avoid the Arby-Q, which is made from the extra shavings of the roast beef. Internal designs are good, and they often play oldies music inside. Lately, their ads--involving the Oven Mitt--have been great as they show QSRs (Quick-Service Restaurants) can be just as good (and oft times better, than sit-down dining chains.
