One of the best headhunters in the game. You needed a quarterback to eat turf on a regular basis, send LT. A regular selection to the Pro Bowl during his career for scaring the opposing QB to death just by looking in his general direction before the snap, not just for making good on the implications. Loses one star for his very recent involvement with Blitz. Making a game to show off the bad 10%'ers, as opposed to the 80% in the middle like EA does, smacks a little of poor judgement, very out of character when compared to his on-field work.
