marlboro reds are the cigs i started on and the one i will always smoke. i started smoking at 14 and im still young but i think that they are the best bold full flavor cigarettes on the planet. people cpmmenting about how people who smoke are dumbasses well you know its your life do what makes you happy and besides we all do things that are bad for us. no ones perfect. indians smoked pure tobacco but i bet it wasnt as good as marlboros. lights arent half bad but i can't stand those nasty ass menthols. all the people i hang out with smoke those and they cant take how i smoke these heavy reds.
