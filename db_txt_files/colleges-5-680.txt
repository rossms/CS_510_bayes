I am not a graduate of UF, I graduated from UNC - Chappel Hill (law). My wife did graduate from here with her law degree though, I fee that she reveved a much better education than I did. Not to nock UNC but UF is a much better school. If you are thinking about going to Law School This is a Must Check Out. I Would receomend it to any future Lawyer.
