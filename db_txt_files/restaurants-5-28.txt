I have been to 2 locations of Caribou Coffee- one in an airport in Minneapolis and one in Dayton, OH. The one in Dayton was pure heaven. Not only is the coffee good, but the atmosphere is extremely relaxing and comfortable. They have big comfy chairs, books and games (like chess) and a fire place. Not at all what you'd expect from a coffee shop. After I was done drinking my coffee I didnt want to leave!
