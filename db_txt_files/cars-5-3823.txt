I have owned my Escape for over a year now and would not trade it for the World. As for the Recalls the other reviewers were talking about My Escape has had NONE. I Love the Power the V6 engine has, It will pass anything untill the computer stops it at 107mph. Its also has GREAT handling in the snow, which we have up hear for 4-5 months out of the year. My only complaint is the road noise the tires pick up on some roads, My Explorer was quieter.
