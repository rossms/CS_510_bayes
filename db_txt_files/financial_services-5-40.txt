I like this bank. They have provided me with great service for 5 years. I'm surprised at the negative comments- but lets be honest. If you write bad checks, you aren't going to like any bank. I highly recommend USBank. They have a great website too and free billpay with your checking account. And you can earn cash rewards on your Visa checkcard.
