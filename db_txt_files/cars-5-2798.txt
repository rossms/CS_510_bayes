The RX7 is an affordable sports car. Being an RX7 owner i could brag up the twin-turbo engine and tell you about all the times i killed civics or mustangs in a race, but to get the true feel of an RX7 you need to upgrade the twin turbo with a GREDDY T3/T4 hybrid turbo and push 600HP out of the RX7, then you will truly know the power of the triangle.
