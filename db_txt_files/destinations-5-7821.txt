The newest attraction in Chicago and one of the best. Millenium Park is just north of the Art Institute and contains a stunning metallic bean structure that reflects the skyline, a gigantic fountain with faces on it that spit streams of water into a pond that children splash in, an amazing soundstage where free concerts are played in the summer, and a cafe that turns into a public skating rink in the winter. It was millions over budget and four years late in coming, but you know, it's actually worth it.
