I have 1999 cougar that I got for graduation. It was what I always wanted. Now, I wish I would have chosen something different! It has been recalled numerous times, the ac has had to be fixed twice, the trunk doesn't open as it should, and it has so many dents that you'd think I was an awful driver, however, I've never even been involved in any type of accident. Just leaning against it leaves a dent... I think its made of tin cans... But I must say it does get good gas mileage.
