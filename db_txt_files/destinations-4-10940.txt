Although i live in Ma. my family still manages to get ourselves down here each and every year. I love the way it is set up. It has a great theme it has great shows great food ok prices. The rides are the best rides I have ever been on. So if you live in the Virginia are please get your self to Busch Gardens. It is Amazingly fun.
