Sacramento is the most exciting team in the NBA, but they really had a rough off-season. They lost Clark, Turk and Pollard, and picked up a very pricy Brad Miller, who put up good stats (not great) in the Eastern Conference (not Western). On the other hand, Webber's legal issues have cleared up in a way the Kobe can only dream about. Unfortunately, Webber is the most injury prone go-to guy in the NBA and the Kings will inevitably falter in the playoffs, but you better belief it'll be worth watching.
