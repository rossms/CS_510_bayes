In this Size Matters and Smaller is Better. No one has mentioned Wickford or East Greenwich or totally cool Narragansett, Waterfire in Providence, Federal Hill - much cheaper to live in than New Jersey, Conn and New York, really nice people, close to everything - beaches, Providence, Boston, New York, Great New England feeling with an artistic twist!
