I don't know what is wrong with me but I seem to be the only one who doesn't like this board game. I don't know if as a kid I had a short attention span or what but this game used to last like 3 hours. I just didn't care to play a board game that went on that long. I would have rather been outside playing. I am sure if I played now, as an adult I would have a different opinion but I just didn't care about property or money when I was younger. It held no meaning or significance to me. Now i am scared to play because I used to really not like it, and I don't want to give it a second chance.
