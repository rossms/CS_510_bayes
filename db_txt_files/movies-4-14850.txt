This was one of those movies that if it wasn't a true story it would be just to good to be true. Denzel Washington was extremely good as the new black coach and Will Patton was equally as good as the demoted white coach. Probably the only thing this movie lacked was the things that it could not have. It was a little to much of the 'fly in the sky' everything is peachy story. Just not a 5 star, but still a great movie for the kids and for the parents to.
