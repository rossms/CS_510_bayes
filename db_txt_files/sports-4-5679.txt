GO CHRIS PAUL!! Way to show that cocky p*ssy Julius Hodge who's boss! Man I agree that he should have been punched harder! And how can anyone call him a punk, I mean Julius deserved that and someone had to do it sooner or later to bring his cockiness level down a couple of notches. Personally, I think he is a wonderful player with alot of talent. We are lucky he didn't play in the ACC tourney cause it would have made Duke's win a little harder!
