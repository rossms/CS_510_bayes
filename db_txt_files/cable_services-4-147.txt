Great for people who live way out in the middle of nowhere. I cannot get cable at my house, so I had to go with this. I get all the locals except for two which I get due to an antenna that you can put on your DirecTV dish (not much $). The guy came out and installed it and everything and I think the thing is great. The only downside is that whenever it rains... the signal is lost. No longer than 5 minute though, so it's not a big deal. Other than that I find nothing wrong with this TV service.
