As a tourist from the East, I was enchanted by the Plaza's ambience -- not just the shops and restaurants, but the art and architecture which is really Spanish (not fake Spanish-Mission) - and the setting beside a lovely stream is charming. The only downside is that K.C. has a pathetic public transportation system (a few mystery busses meander about the city from time to time), so one must drive to the Plaza. However, parking is plentiful and free. The many high-rise apartment buildings (and hotels) surrounding the Plaza area appear to be very upscale. Lots of wealth here!
