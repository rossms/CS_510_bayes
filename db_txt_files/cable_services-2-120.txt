I bought it for Serius Left so I could listen to Mike Malloy. Aftetr I bought the system they started carrying all NBA and NHL games. In November they preempted the Malloy program about 80% of the time. They changed the deal after I plunked down over $400 for my system and their subscription and I feel ripped-off. Other than temporarily losing signal nearly every time I go under a bridge, there is a good selection of items. If they had not changed the deal from what was promised, I would recommend them. The way it is, I would say, caveat emptor .
