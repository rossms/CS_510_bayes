I only ate here once but I really enjoyed my meal and the general atmosphere. I wish we had a Cracker Barrel closer to where I live. They have great side dishes so you'll be very clueless if you're indecisive like me.... Amazing Mac & Cheese too! They also give you biscuits and corn bread... mmmm... AND there's a cute store with lots of random items. I bought a harmonica, silly putty, apple butter and a homemade chocolate lollipop there! :)
