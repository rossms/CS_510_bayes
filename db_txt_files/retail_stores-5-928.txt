I am in total agreement with you Anna. A and F is definately the best clothing store out there. The clothes are great, and very high quality. They are not overly expensive and always look good. I also think the music and the cute guys on the wall are a great bonus while shopping. Superb store...nothing can compare to my A&F !!!
