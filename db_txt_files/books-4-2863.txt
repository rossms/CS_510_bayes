Beevor's Stalingrad is an impressive work. For those who are unaware of the savagery of the WWII Russian Front, it is a useful and concise work. But more importantly, it portrays the desperation and bestial qualities of both sides' leaders and High Commands: Hitler's insane abandonment of the Sixth Army and Stalin's order to shoot all suspect Russian soldiers (which resulted in the deaths of approximately 15,000 Russian men -- more than all the Allied Soldiers who died in combat on June 6th, 1944 in Normandy under fire!).It's a good read by a good writer.
