A beast from the freethrow line and behind the arc.I have not seen this kind of range from a shooter since that guy from Indiana State.Update:Some of my fellow UNC fans are looking extremely foolish on here.Wake up guys!J.J. is a great player, even if it is for DUKE.One flaw I will give J.J. is he seems to force the drive sometimes and fails to kick out for an open player.
