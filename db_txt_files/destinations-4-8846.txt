Kodiak is slay, no question about it. Ice Bear is good too, a little less burn but real nice flavor. After 4-5 years of spittin' Kodiak I've moved to Skoal. My teeth feel like they're gonna fall out when spit too much Kodiak. Whenever I'm bass fishin' and I want a better buzz, I'll fire in a loaf of T$han's K'Bear, but when my gums start hurtin' it's back to Skoal...
