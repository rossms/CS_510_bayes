i guess part of the reason i liked this movie is because of duchovny. i don't normally like driver but she was alright in this one. it is a rather predictable and lukewarm movie. but what's great about it is that bonnie hunt took today's disappointing romantic comedy genre and went back to the heartwarming fairytale values of the old classics.
