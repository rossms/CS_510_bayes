Entertaining yes. Cheesey and hammy up the wazzoo yes but hey it's Hollywood so what do you expect. Is the book better?.... oh yeah. Definitely read the book it goes into much greater detail and gives a lot of technical data about storms, waves and how big they can get and the damage they can do, the process of drowning and accounts of people revived from it etc. Very interesting and much more enthralling than the movie. The movie had good effects and was certainly engaging in a tense action way but the screen was dripping with cheesey scenes and lines. All in all it was worth seeing.
