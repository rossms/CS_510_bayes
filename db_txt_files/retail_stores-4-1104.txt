People should stop hatin on Hot Topic. Isnt it good that kids who shop at HT are just victims of conformity. Cuz then, you can be one of the few that r truly different. So quit yer bi**in. If everyone stopped shoppin at these stores then what? We need people to follow mainstream so we can seperate ourselves from them. So shhh, u noe im right.
