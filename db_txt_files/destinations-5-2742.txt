Oh I love the paradise sceries of Hawaii. I have visited the Big Island and seen the Hei'aus and the Volcano National Park with the lava flowing out of the Kilauea crater. I also enjoyed Honolulu and the Hanauma Bay beach. I don't care much for surfing, so I never went to the northern part of O'ahu.
