A good actress and beautiful too, however I guess I'm still a little upset with her about the vietnam war. Let me explain....I don't mind that she was agaisnt the war and spoke out about it...however she tried to get us servicemen to go along with her....she did'nt seem to understand that we did'nt have a choice, had I refused to return to my ship I would have been thrown out on a dishonorable discharge. I guess this is'nt the proper forum for this...sorry if I upset anyone.
