Ontario like Virginia and the Carolinas is the bastion of British Civilization in British America. They fly the Union Jack, the Flag of the British Empire - the sentinel of Freedom and Democracy. The only problem with Ontario is that it is scarred of Quebec, so the wealth of Ontario flows into Quebec to keep Quebec going. Ontario - stand up and be counted. It is time to stand up to Quebec! Don't let the tyrants walk all over you! Sic Semper Tyannis! Remember Robert E. Lee!!!
