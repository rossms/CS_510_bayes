For those of you unfamiliar with Papa Murphy's pizza (formerly Papa Aldo's), this is a great concept. The pizza is cheaper than you will find anywhere, and you bake it in your own oven to make it as soft or as crispy as you like it. It's really good tasting pizza and, like I said, the price is right on!
