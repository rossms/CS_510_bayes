It is time for America to realize that reverse discrimination also exists. And that there needs to be laws to protect the majority race as well as the minority race. Much more enforcemnt is needed. Special government organizations need to be set up to check and enforce those rights. If we cannot come to terms on true equality, then separation is the only answer. Separate but equal; however, if the civil rights law was amended to include protection for the rights of the majority race, then maybe true equality or civil rights as it was intended to be can be more realized.
