In a word- DARK. This is one of the weirdest films ever made. Funyn at times, and at others just downright sick. Peter Sellers is fantastic in his portrayl of 3 different characters. But the finest performances come from Sterling Hayden as Colonel Jack D. Ripper and from George C. Scott. There is much comedy and some moments of true sadness. Definitely a cult classic of epic proportions.
