Since her debut in Once Upon a Time in America Jennifer Connelly seems to have mastered her acting craft to a T. Her choice in movies are good, but my only problem however is that too many of the roles she chooses are way too depressing. Requiem for a Dream, Pollock, House of Sand and Fog, A Beautiful Mind although excellent films all of these characters were too troubled and seemed to carry the whole weight of the world on their shoulders. It would be nice if she balanced her choices and did something a little more light and entertaining as shes well prooven herself to be an outstanding actress.
