Win or Lose, These are my boys. I have been a Redskin fan since I was a little kid. I am 37, and unlike some football fans, I love my team no matter what. They will always be a 5-star team in my eyes. Yes, they have struggled. They have changed head coaches, players, and even football arena's (only 5 minutes from the house I grew up in, and is still owned by my family). Hail to these guys! Now and Forever!!!!!
