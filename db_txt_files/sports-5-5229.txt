He was the greatest college player of all time hands down. Who had a career like him? No one. Every body hates him cause he dominated their teams. But you know, if your a Blue Devil fan he was the second coming of Christ. People need to give the man is props and let it go. He made the greatest shot in NCAA history and probably made the biggest clutch free throws in the greatest upset in NCAA history when the Devils beat UNLV in the National Semifinals in '91. We all witnessed greatness.
