You'll notice a trend with this list and the ranking of an original movie, and then it's sequal. I saw Final Destination long after it had been out, picked it up from the $5.99 rack at Walmart. I really liked it. So naturally, I thought, hey, I need to see the sequal, as it was clearly left wide open for one. And so I went ahead and bought that too. Ouch. The only thing this one had going for it was some rather creative death scenes, which, unfortunatly don't equal a good movie. The plot was semi-interesting, but really a carbon copy of the first movie.
