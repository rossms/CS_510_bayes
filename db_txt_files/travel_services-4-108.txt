I flew Alaska several times last year between LA and Portland. The flights were ALWAYS on time, the service was good, and the people were generally nice. The planes aren't anything special, but you will definitely save yourself alot of money. The frequent flier program is by far the best out there. Given the choice, I'd choose Alaska over any of the bigger carriers.
