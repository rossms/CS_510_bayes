These days Barnes and Noble (Borders, too) has become almost a library as well as a bookstore. When I lived in NYC, I would spend rainy days sitting in the aisles (with dozens of others) reading for hours. The selection is huge and diverse. In addition to books, they have a great rack of magazines and many out of town newspapers. The prices are reasonable and the service is generally helpful.
