Now you have a guy who becomes boss of one of the most troublesome peoples (apologies for the generalisation) in the world, has to fight an upcoming maffia and has to regain Russian confidence after the end of the cold war. What does he accomplish? He is definitely better than drunky Yeltsin, but that does not say a lot. What he has accomplished is that he is doing something about all the afore mentioned issues and lets people know this too!
