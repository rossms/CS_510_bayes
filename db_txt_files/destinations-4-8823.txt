Although I don't chew tobacco I did try it several times in high school and this was apparently the chew of choice. Man does this stuff knock you for a whirl! I remember taking a very modest wad and slowly chewing it on the side of my mouth and within probably 5 minutes I was spinning like a top. The last time I tried this it had the exact same effect. I was at a friends wedding about 6 years ago and a bunch of us decided it would be fun to pick up a pack of chew, drink some beers and play some poker in our hotel room. Let's just say this was a big mistake, I was green like the Grinch.
