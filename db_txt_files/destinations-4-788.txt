I was shocked and surprised to find Toronto and Montreal to be more happening and exciting than many cities I have been too. The cities are very clean and well-preserved. There are lots of different immigrants in each city. Plenty of interesting clubs, bars and restaurants to visit. Canada is a great place to visit.
