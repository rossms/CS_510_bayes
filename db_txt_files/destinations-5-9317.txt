El Moro Fortress in San Juan is a must see there. The history of the place is very interesting. The Spanish built this magnificent fort to protect their interests in the New World. It was part of their strategic defenses throughout the new world. In my opinion, it is the most beautiful fortress in the Caribbean. It is set on a precipise overlooking the Atlantic and old San Juan. Visit it for the views and the history.
