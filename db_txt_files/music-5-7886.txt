Livin' On A Prayer is a very genial song. It comes from some very deep feelings of Jon and the Guys. I love that song, and so all the others. The video is very simple and that makes the song even better. I like the idea of a video-concert 'cause you can appreciate the song for itself and not just for some nudities or other stupid things like all singers like to do now.
