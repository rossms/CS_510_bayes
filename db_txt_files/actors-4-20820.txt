There is nothing wrong with this womans body. Jessica is fit and healthy (except for the smoking), isn't that the goal of most woman who care about their appearance. I am naturally thin with an athletic, yet feminem build. There is no dieting or fasting in my lifestyle. People who consider Jessica to be unhealthy looking and thin are not healthy looking or thin - to bad.
