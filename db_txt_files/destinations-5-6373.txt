I've lived in the Nashville area for almost twenty years. Not only do we have easy access to some of the best entertainment in the country, we're home to the Tennesee Titans, excellent shopping, state of the art medical facilities (Vanderbilt Medical Center), beautiful residentials with tree lined streets and sidewalks where neighbors can walk their dogs after dark without fear of being accosted. Our school systems rival the best of the best (despite what you may read down below), and the scenery and lakes are all incredible. But dont just take my word for it, come see for yourself.
