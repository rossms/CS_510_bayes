This was a pretty good movie. It was better than the first Nutty Professor movie. You see a lot more of Sherman's Klump's family in this one and that's one of the things which makes it funny because the family are one of the funniest features in these movies. It was a little boring in some parts, but overall this was a pretty good movie.
