this is a great product I think that portable cd players was a good invention its great how you can listen to your music and go into different rooms in your house and still be able to hear it very well because the headphones are in your ears! sony is a really good product, there stuff never usually breaks (no of mine) I think sony's portable cd players (any of them) are made really well and are hard to make skip around, so I give sony D series a 5!
