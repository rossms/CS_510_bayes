This was one of my favorite books as a kid. It was one of the first books to take me in so completely that I was totally immersed in the world of the book. I was genuinely scared when reading it for the first time. It is exactly the kind of fantasy that kids love - close enough to their own reality to make it believable. Really sensitive kids probably shouldn't read it until they're older, but if your kid isn't that prone to nightmares, this is the book for them! (Adults should read it too. It's a quick read - only a couple of hours. And completely worth it!)
