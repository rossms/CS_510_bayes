A decent state with some good things. The DC suburbs although rather frenetic have a good degree of social sophistication. Ocean city has some attributes that are positive. The Cumberland is another culture- one that is not good- seems more in tune with West Virginia and the rest of backward Appalachia But take the good- not the bad.
