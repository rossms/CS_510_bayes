Dickerson was like a thoroughbred. He ran high and didn't have any spectacular moves. He just was faster than anyone else. He just ran and ran like a horse. Just give the guy a little opening and he would bust through and just keep on going. Single season record for yards in a season with 2,105 yards. The only running back ever to top 1,800 yards in 3 seasons which is amazing if you think about it considering only a handful have even reached 1,800 yards. If not for his attitude and selfishness for money, he might've been the best ever in alot of people's eyes.
