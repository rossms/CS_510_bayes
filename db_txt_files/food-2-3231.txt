We love the frozen dinners and the chicken pot pies w broccoli, BUT I bought the chicken pies this week and found the recipe changed. We were very disappointed and hope this product [chicken pot pie w portabella mushrooms and broccoli] fails quickly and you go back to old formula. Very short on chicken. Not nearly as good.
