I'm becoming a definite admirer of Vietnamese director Tran Anh Hung.This,his 1993 debut,delicately describes the life of a servant girl in a 1950's household.Its mastery of colour and lighting,and its sensitive development of a quietly reflective mood are immensely satisfying.His follow-up,the Venice Golden Lion winner Cyclo,is dazzling,dizzying and dangerous,while his latest,At the Height of Summer -exceptionally exquisite and (like its predecessors) enticingly enigmatic- is a real treasure.
