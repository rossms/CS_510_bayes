My first car is the 1996 LX version, and I absolutely love it...it rides pretty smooth...but it does have flaws. In the winter, it's very difficult to handle (in icy conditions, etc.) so if that's the kind of weather you have all the time, be careful with this! Otherwise, it looks cool, it's big, so it can fit a lot of people, and it has ok gas mileage...
