I would rate Raleigh 5 stars and Durham 1 star and Chapel Hill 3 stars. Raleigh is a great southern City with friendly people. Durham is a crime pit. Chapel Hill is nothing more than a City overrun with Northerners and probably has more PhDs than Cambridge. Overall, of the three, Raleigh is the best. Coming from a lifetime up North it was easy to blends in with these folks. I would recommend anyone thinking about visiting or living in the Triangle check out Raleigh or Chapel Hill but not Durham. I now live 35 miles southeast of Raleigh in the country and have made it my permanent home.
