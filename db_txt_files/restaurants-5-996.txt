reasonably priced for what you get...i usually get a quarter chicken white with mashed potatoes and macaroni and cheese with their corn bread...i'm not a corn bread fan, but i like theirs a lot. their meals taste down-home, with comfort foods such as my usual meal. you've got many choices and they're cooking up more nowadays.
