They should have just cut out the plot entirely and gone straight to the part where all the people get killed. There was all this stupid acting and s**t. Just get to the blood already!!! The bloodbath is OK at least. But I don't like the fact that they used pig blood-only gallons and gallons and gallons of freshly squeezed human blood will satisfy me! VALIUM!!!
