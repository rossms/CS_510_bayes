Jefferson was a great philospher and a progressive thinker. Too bad he forgot his republican ideals once he arrived at the White House. He did a slightly above-average job as president, though (except for that whole embargo thing). I bet Madison wasn't too happy with the mess he left for him, either. He was a good diplomat in international relations after his presidency, but his service as chief executive was largely mediocre.
