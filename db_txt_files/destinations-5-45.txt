My sister has been in Mali Bamako twice during her french studies at the University of Oslo. Including she learned the local language at a university in Paris, where she lived for one year. She showed her family lots of slides from the lovely country, photoes of beautiful Africans, young old, the old trade city Timbuktu, animales and just the special landscape. We all just sat their amazed impressed, everybody with this desire of travelling there experience a real adventour! Well, maybe one day... :-)
