This was quite boring, and i'm talking slow and really bad songs. I love the disney songs in almost all their movies, but u couldn't get a worst movie for songs. The animation is great and it is an original story, but it is just 2 boring and slow to get to any action, romance or climax. If u like fun, disney movies with great interesting characters AVOID THIS! However if u like an in depth story that requires u to think, than enjoy by all means, you'll love it. But all-in-all VERY DISAPPOINTING.
