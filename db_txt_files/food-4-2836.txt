I grew up with Campbell's soup, so I would feel badly giving it less than 4 stars..however, the only one I really eat is the Tomato (made with milk). The Chicken Noodle is edible but not too filling or exciting. I use the Cream of Chicken or Celery when making a casserole. Not the heartiest of soups, you can't really make a meal out of a can of Campbell's but it has its uses.
