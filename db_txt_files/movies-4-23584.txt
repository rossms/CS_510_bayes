Very ambitious rendition of the legend of King Arthur and Merlin the Magician. The entire look of the film was incredible. It really makes you feel like you are there in Camelot. Some of the costumes were a little out there, but that doesn't really take away from the rest of the film. Overall, a solid piece of work.
