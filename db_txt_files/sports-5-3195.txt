Possibly the best left-fielder of all-time, he played almost concurrently with Williams, who is also ranked very high at this position. Frankly, as a Red Sox fan, and a huge admirer of Williams I would say this (to paraphrase Bill James.) I would take Musial on the basepaths, Musial in the field, Musial in the dugout, Musial in the clubhouse, and Williams only with the wood in his hand. And Musial could hit a little too.
