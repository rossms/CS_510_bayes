Okay, now that all of you Janus-Lovers have watched your money tank, I'm curious about how much hyperbole you have now! If the folks at Janus would pay more attention to managing their funds and less attention to getting themselves in the media, I might not have lost over 40% of my money in Enterprise! As soon as [if?] it ever comes back up, it's hasta la viva Janus!
