my 14 year old brother had to ride this quad(which is my dads) because his blaster was still getting fixed with new parts. he got 2nd place with this! and my dad rides this quad and he does really good on the hole shot and doesn't even have custom parts exept for an axle which doesn't in crease the speed really. this quad kicks @$$
