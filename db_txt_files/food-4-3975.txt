Good chips. I like the regular best. My kids like the flavored.I remember the old commercial when I see Ruffles back in my childhood Ruffles have Ripples { with a rolled tongue} I like Ruffles better than other chips. they are usually the first ones i pick. I think they are flavorful.Good and crisp when fresh.
