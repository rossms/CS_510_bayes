Now that the election is supposedly over and we still do not have an elected pres I stand firmly behind GWB!! Gore will lead his country to ruin. Gore supporters, aren't you sorry now?? I hope that GWB puts up one ****uva fight to keep his win! This election has shined new light on the despicable nature of politics and media in the US! Governor Bush, DON'T STOP !!!!
