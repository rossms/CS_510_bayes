My mom has a 1996 Accord that we bought new. It was the 25th anniversity edition with AC and radio but no cruise, PW, or PL. Very dependable but bland. Styling of the 96-97 models are not to my liking - 1994-95s are better. The only problem was the main engine seal broke and leaked all the oil out. The car was driven only a couple of miles to the library before we discovered. Honda towed the car and serviced for free even though the car was out of warranty.
