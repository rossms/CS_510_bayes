I liked this movie. Matt decides he will give up sex for lent for 40 days and nights one reason he decided to do this because no one thought he could actually go through with it. When more time kept going by his friends and co-workers decide to start a lottery on him for when he will cave in. While Matt is trying to get over his ex-girlfriend he meets Erica at the laundry mat and they end up together which was a bit predictable. I thought Josh Hartnett did a good job in this movie.
