Not sure about the food, but the latest commercial with the young woman on the wooden bull is not fit for prime time tv. My kids have seen this undulating young beauty and wondered what was going on..When I asked carls web site about the commerical, they said it was meant to be humorous and tongue in cheek. Get rid of the commercial and improve the food.
