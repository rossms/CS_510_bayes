We purchased a Taurus SE over two years ago and have driven it nearly 50,000 miles. So far it has provided us with reliable, comfortable transportation. There have been no major mechanical problems. A rear window motor had to be replaced but it was covered by the warrenty and the dealer was courteous and prompt. It may not be the best looking car in the world, but hey, its American made and has done everything I have asked of it. At his point I'll certainly consider buying another.
