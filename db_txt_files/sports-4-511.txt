I have to give credit to Piazza. He is undoubtedly the best OFFENSIVE catcher in the history of baseball as a sport. No catcher previous to him or currently can match his offensive output. However, his defensive ability as a catcher is appalling. He throws out a single-digit amount of attempted base stealers and has an absolutely horendous arm. He is a one-dimensional player, but is damn good at that one dimension, hitting.
