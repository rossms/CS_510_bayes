A nice alternative to a burger when you're in a rush. I have to say, the sandwiches aren't the best thing you'll ever taste - in fact, they're pretty unremarkable. But when you need a quick bite to eat while you're on the road, and you're looking for something that's pretty consistant from place to place, they're a safe, relatively healthful bet.
