My brother and I have loved this cereal since we were little kids. It is often hard to find, but shows up in a few stores near us from time to time, including Expect Discounts, IGA, and Adams. You can also purchase it online at the Quaker Online store and The Candy Store. I've never tasted a better cereal. I just wish they made t-shirts with its logo like they do for Quisp! :)
