My wife loves this stuff....the only problem is that there appears to be tea leaf grinds at the bottom of the bottle. This is our first case of the stuff and I'm wondering if this is normal or if this stuff has been sitting around for a while, or if we just got the bottom of the barrel? Any thoughts?
