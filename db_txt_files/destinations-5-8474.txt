re.Johnny Suede rating comments; every thing will be fine, just turn your self in; they will find a nice quiet ward for you, and you'll be back on your meds in no time! I learned to swim here 60 years ago; I,m amazed that the pool has not changed at all! We used to love to explore the grotto, and lay out on the cement island. My memory still retains the chlorine smell of the pool, and the foot baths! Chris Carroll, 04-26-04
