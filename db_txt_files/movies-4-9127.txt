More tame than what I thought it would be and definately shows that Jack Black is getting into mainstream films after playing bit roles and having one lead in a film so far (High Fidelity and Shallow Hal) The film was very cute and as per usual Joan Cusack was brilliant. Its great seeing how the kids from the class progress and come out of their shells and seeing Jack do all his usual faces and singing. Definately worth watching.
