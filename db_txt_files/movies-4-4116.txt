I think that it was a brilliant movie who's purpose was to scare children into being good or not to be a fat kid or gum chewer. I think it has a good message but those oompa loompas freaked me out. Bad for fat children who dream of a chocolate factories because their fat asses'll get stuck in a pipe!
