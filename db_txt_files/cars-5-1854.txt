I own a 98 Sonata GL and I'm quite pleased with it. Like some others, I didn't care for the Hyundai at first. But this car has grown on me, and I like it far better than the Ford Taurus I owned before. I took a 3700 mile round trip in it this past summer and it got nearly 28 mpg with the 3.0 V-6. It also "feels" more powerful than you would expect from a Korean import. When I'm finally ready to trade, I'm certainly going to give the new Sonata LX strong consideration.
