I thought I knew about all I needed about dolphins until I saw this movie. Especially moving, was the part toward the end when the guy who left his dolphin friend for a 4 month business trip. The dolphin gave him the cold shoulder when he finally returned, but all ill feelings were suddenly vanquished when the man let go of that plastic wind-up fish. I don't think there was a dry eye in the place.
