Olive Garden is a generic Italian dining experience. I feel sorry for the wait staff that work there because of all the customer complaints they have to deal with. The food recipes are no big secret and could easily be replicated at home. They definitley need to come up with something other than their Soup and Salad and Pasta Bowl specials. You can go to any Italian dining and get those.
