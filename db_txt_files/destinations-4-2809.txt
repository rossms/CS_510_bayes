I've lived here my whole life. I grew up in NE Philly, and its a great place to live and work. There's plenty of culture in Philadelphia. The cheesesteaks and soft pretzels are awesome!! The bars/clubs are always a good time (however, very pricy in Old City). The only reason I went with 4 stars instead of 5 is because of the ghettos, and they're expanding. You can see the lower parts of the NE starting to go to hell. What a shame. Note: Whatever you do, don't venture into North or West Philly, big big mistake.
