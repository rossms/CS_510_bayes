I find it harder and harder to open the cans that the coffee is packed in. The labels prevent the openers from leaving a smooth edge on the cans, no matter which opener I use. A suggestion, especially for older people and those with arthritis, is to have a pull-tab top on all cans. They are so much easier to open and leave a clean edge on the can. Thank-you...
