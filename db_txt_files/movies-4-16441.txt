Robin Williams has again proven that he can play just about any role and be believable. I've always considered Robin Williams to be a comedian, but this combined with his performance in Good Will Hunting proves that he is a first class actor as well. Most don't realize that this is actually based on a true story, and Patch Adams really is a doctor. I think that many find it to be unrealistic because in our greedy and selfish culture, people like Patch, who care about others, are scarce.
