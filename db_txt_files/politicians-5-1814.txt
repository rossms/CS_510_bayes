After decades of decline and mismanagement, Ed Rendell turned Philadelphia into one of the best-run, cleanest, most efficient city governments in America. He was known as America's Mayor until 9/11 transferred that title to New York's mayor. Rendell is now trying - with much resistance from the state legislature's entrenched rural/Republican majority - to work the same magic in the Pennsylvania capitol. If he succeeds at the state level as he did in Philadelphia, Ed Rendell may have a bright future on the national political scene.
