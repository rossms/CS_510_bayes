There probably should be separate lists for both diet and regular soft drinks. If there were a separate list for diet colas, Diet Dr. Pepper would get five stars from me. While it isn't particularly close to the original, it is much closer than its competitors. Nevertheless, when diet drinks are the only available option, I don't grimace and reluctantly reach for a Diet Dr. Pepper as I would with other diet soft drinks. Plus, I think this drink still has caffeine which I'm not afraid of... yet.
