Even as an album that boasts such upbeat classics as Git It In Your Soul and Boogie , Mingus Ah Um is not only a fabulously free-spirited album (although it definitely IS that), but also one that has some softer, more introspective moments such as Goodbye Porkpie Hat . Mingus shows his amazing talent as one of jazz's most talented composers and bassists on this classic album which stands out as a landmark recording!
