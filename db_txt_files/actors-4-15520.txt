Whoa, Jar Jar. You're confusing her with Barbara Olsen, the wife of US Solicitor General Ted Olsen. She was a beautiful and talented writer who wrote the book, Hell to Pay which described her view of the state of the US upon the departure of Bill Clinton from the presidency, which described a terrifyingly vulnerable America, due to Bill Clinton's lack of moral leadership for the previous 8 years. It is ironic that the book went to press on 9/13/01. AFTERTHOUGHT: Sorry, the irony is that she died on the plane that crashed into the Pentagon on 9/11/01.
