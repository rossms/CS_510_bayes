2001 may be the year for the Jackets. The pieces are all here: QB George Godsey, TB Joe Burns, WR's Kelly Campbell, Kerry Watkins, and Will Glover, DE Greg Gathers. The only question is how much former off. coordinator Ralph Friedgen's departure will affect them. With him missing for last year's peach bowl, the offense was scoreless in the 2nd half. But if the offense comes together, and this team can beat FSU for the first time ever (and Clemson), Tech could be in Pasadena come January 2002.
