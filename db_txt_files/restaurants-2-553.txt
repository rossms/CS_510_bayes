I truly don't understand how a product could be so overrated. People from the South are particularly proud of Krispy Kreme donuts, but I have no idea why. Maybe its a southern thing. They are way too sweet with too much glaze on them, and they're expensive. If you ever visit Lawrence, KS, you've got to try Joe's Donuts. Now that's a donut!
