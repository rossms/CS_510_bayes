This is a micro distilled vodka that I came across. I'm pretty impressed with this one. It's a corn vodka that's apparently been 6 times distilled by a fellow in Austin, TX by the name of Tito Beveridge. Smell is a little mediciny / astringent, slight sweet flavour (I'm not sure if I can taste the corn), and very clean and smooth finish. Zero harshness. Nice job for a micro distiller. Not the best, but very very good overall. Puts away Absolut, Pearl, Smirnoff and many other also rans. Haven't tried it yet as a mixer, but I'm sure it would do well.
