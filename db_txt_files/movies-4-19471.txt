I'm a horror movie fan, and I know that the Friday the 13th movies aren't the best horrors, but if I were to pick which part I liked best it would be this one...part 6-Jason Lives...why? Well the reason I felt that this movie was the best one is because its this movie where Jason gets all of his strength and power after being dug up by Tommy.
