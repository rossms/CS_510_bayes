Wow! You don't know who Simeon Rice is? Do you call yourself a football fan? Simeon Rice has been an utter fireball at defensive end for most of his career at Arizona and Tampa Bay. He's had eight 10+ sack seasons out of 10 years, including the last 6 seasons in a row. He had 10.5 sacks his rookie year alone, and has had 15 or more sacks three times in his career. He even has the speed to drop back in coverage. He has 5 career interceptions, despite being on the d-line. He's a big reason why Tampa Bay won a SuperBowl.
