Excellent school ,yet it doesnt carry quite the same clout as Harvard does in the general public. To those who went to college and recognize the qualities of the various universities in the nation, Yale does stand out as an excellent school, but to the everyday guy, the name draws a curious look, like they should know that it's a great school, but dont know exactly why. Yale has produced quite a few politicians and presidents and is Harvard's rival, yet the joke at Harvard is: What do Harvard and Yale students have in common? They both got into Yale.
