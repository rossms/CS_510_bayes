"The History of Violence" is a smart, quirky film - an atypical, modern-day western - about the culture of violence and how it dominates our world. Though the plot's exceedingly far-fetched, at least it's not cliched. Lots of harrowing twists and turns in this one, and unpredictable enough to keep viewers guessing. In a large sense, "The History of Violence" is a message film, dealing with issues of truth, trust, and personal redemption. Head and shoulders above the usual Hollywood fare. ****1/2
