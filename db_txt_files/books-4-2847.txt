Just what the Doctor ordered - documenting individuals and their lives, contributions, hardships, and achievements from a fantastic generation of Americans, right about the time that that generation starts to fade away. My grandmother recently passed on and she was from this same generation and she told the same types of stories as documented in this book - she never completed the 8th grade, but thanks to her times and experiences she was as smart as anyone from my generation (X, I suppose).
