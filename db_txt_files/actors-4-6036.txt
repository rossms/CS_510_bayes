He's probably one of the best yong actors in Hollywood, but I don't really see him as a sex simbol. On the contrary, he has an irritating smile that reminds me of a toothpaste tv comercial! I only like him because he transmits life to what he does, it looks like he's really the person he's actually playing (and that's not very common these days...)
