My home, always has been and always will be. Amazing history. Our food may not be the best on the planet, but where else can you get a decent cup of Earl Grey Tea, Baked Beans and Maltesers? We have the Houses of Paliament, The Tower of London, The River Thames, The London Eye and Big Ben to name but a few. We have some of the most beautiful country-sides. What I love most about England is the weather. It's so unpredictable. We can have four seasons in one day, the coldest winters and this gives enough room to look forward to the occasional hot summers.
