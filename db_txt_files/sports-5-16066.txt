Th most productive back in the NFL for the last 4 years. That is a fact. More that Preist Holmes, Marhal Faulk, or Ladanien Tomlinson He's strong, fast as sh-t and he's a bad-ss. His fumbles aren't big of a problem as everyone thinks. His fumbles-to-touch ratio is actually the exact same as Marcus Allen, a hall-of-famer. Ahman is the man.
