I assume we are only rating the first Matrix, right? The first Matrix was brilliant! ... because it left unanswered questions. Unfortunately when they try to answer the questions, the story is very unrealizable and - dare I say - puerile and absurd. The story was an afterthought to try to somehow explain why reality would be a huge networked simulation. The story needs alot of work. See the first movie though for its uniqueness.
