Great quality! Lasts forever. The prices a little high, but the quality on their outerwear is worth it. I have 3 daughters and I am able to hand down their winter coats and snowsuits because they are durable (even in ND winters!) Wash it and it is brand new! Their customer service is awesome! and you can't beat their return policy.
