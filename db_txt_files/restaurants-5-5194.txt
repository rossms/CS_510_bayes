I love it but it can get a bit loud especially at night. I like their new flat bread pizza (great vegetarian option) but it can be a little greasy and dry but it's not too bad. The one closest to my house has $2 drafts every night, the bar is 21+ after 10pm, and it's a great place to take my family or meet up with friends any day or night of the week!
