Too generic a category to rate accurately. If you should select a 97,99,01 Napa unfiltered Mondavi Cab you will have a very good wine. To choose a 98,00 or a central coast Mondavi is noting to write home about. He has way too many bottlings to write them all off. Try a 97 Napa Cab. You will be impressed.
