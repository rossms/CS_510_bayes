Back in the day when we were using Internet Explorer 3.0 (and even the older versions..those were just downright terrible)...it was really horrid...in fact I always used my trusty Netscape 3.0...and I even used Netscape 4.0 and never even had the chance to use IE 4.0...but as soon as IE 5.0 came out...it was like 100 times better than Netscape 5.0...and it hasn't been any different since then...it once was horrible..and is now the best...but one still has to wonder why???
