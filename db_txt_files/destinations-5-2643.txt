best city in the country... the skyline is awesome! Chicago has so much to offer in terms of culture, nightlife, etc. And its very easy to get around... the city's subways and famous elevated L lines go everywhere. The city is very dense, and not just in the downtown Loop. All the neighborhoods are urban and bustling and exciting. The Second City... Second to None.
