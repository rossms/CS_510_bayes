I will give the movie 2 stars for the excellent acting by Kirsten Dunst...but other than that the movie was a complete failure altogether. Anne Rice is a horrible novelist, and any movie based on her books is destined to doom most likely. Tom Cruise was just horrible and very unconvincing as well....don't waste your time or money on it...
