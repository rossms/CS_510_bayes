African destinations should probably be further divided into separate lists for Saharan African and Sub-Saharan Africa. Nevertheless, Kilimanjaro would have to be near the top of any list. (If memory serves) from a mountain standpoint, Africa has been relatively stable geologically as the other continents drifted around it. This means that the views from those relatively few large mountains that are present in Africa (mostly volcanic I suppose) would be rather extraordinary.
