It was allright, but.....I've seen better. For one, They didn't have to show that disturbing rape scene so graphically. I mean, I've seen a lot of celluloid cinema containing controversial stuff, but how they zoom up on a rape like that really was too much for me. And all the racial slurs said in this movie...Too much use of the n'word. I really hate that. Every minute the n'word goes flying. One redeeming feature is Samuel L.Jackson's brilliant performance though.
