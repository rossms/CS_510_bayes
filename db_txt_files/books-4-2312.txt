Cheers to Morrie Turner on nearly 40 years of producing a strip that attempts to bring people together regardless of race background. He has also spent a lot of time visiting schools supporting the concepts of education and unity. Wee Pals earned a place in comics history as the first strip of its kind in major newspapers, and Turner is now the recipient of a Lifetime Achievement Award from his fellow cartoonists for all the work he has done through his strip on behalf of the human race.
