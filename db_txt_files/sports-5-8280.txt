Shaq is easily the most dominant player in the NBA. This guy goes out night after night and out performs everyone else on the floor. No other one player can check him, and he goes for 25+ a night against double and triple teams EVERY night! Granted, the one chink in his armour is his freethrow shooting, but without Shaq, the Lakers would have a record something like the Bulls or Rockets.
