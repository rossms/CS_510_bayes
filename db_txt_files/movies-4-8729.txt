American Pie was better than I expected. There were some really funny parts. I loved the band girl. One of the best lines is when she says, 'Say my name, what's my name bitch?' I had to rewind that like 4 times and was cracking up. It was just the same old story of teens losing their virginity but they made it really funny.
