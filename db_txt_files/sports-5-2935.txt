One of the premiere ballplayers ever to play the game, only Hank Aaron is better, all around. Ruth could hit for power and average. He was a team leader and fantastically fun spokesman/figurehead for the game as it became the national past-time! not only that, but he could pitch and eat, like a workhorse. In this age of men dressing like women and crying over their clothes and shoes, we could use more of us like Babe Ruth!
