Emmitt is a good back, but the best ever? It's not even close. To all of you Cowboy fans who don't like people saying that he is only as good as his line, think about this. I don't know the exact numbers, but if you take each season he played and count the number of offensive lineman that made the pro-bowl each season, the total is around 20. Payton had 3, Barry had 1. Need I say more?
