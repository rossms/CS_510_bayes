I did not go to Bryn Mawr College, but live near it and have had the pleasure of knowing more than a few bright, interesting women who have gone there. As I see it, Bryn Mawr is a uniquely democratic college that fosters learning and discussion on many levels. Women there have a chance to be strong in their own right without either the distraction or competition of men.
