An all-around great movie and a heart-warming tale of a drop-in Uncle who for the first time sees himself playing the closest thing to a father that he has ever played when he takes care of his brother's kids. A whole lot of funny moments mixed with some drama and a great performance by John Candy. I love Uncle Buck's car! RIP John Candy!
