Memento IS an engrossing and engaging triller. Part of the reason is they way it runs...backwards. The actual viewing of the film causes the moviegoer to sit and remember, as if in some way THEY were the main character....it's a film that actually makes you use your mind as oppossed to losing it, like so many dumb hollywood films.
