Potentially the next big thing. No question about emotional range, but she's yet to tackle something she can get her fingers into (while entertaining, the X-MEN spots can only be viewed as financial windfalls). Should stay as pretty as she is, as a hottie makeover will ruin her cred. May be my generation's one true shot at a serious actress.
