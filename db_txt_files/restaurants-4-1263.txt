I love Arby's roast beef. I've been eating them for over 30 years. Love the Horsey sauce, always get the giant beef sandwich. Downsides are the restaurants themselves are pretty low class feeling inside, not always a 'clean' look to them. The drinks are average quality soda fountain, but you can fill them yourself. And, there aren't many Arby's around. Bummer.
