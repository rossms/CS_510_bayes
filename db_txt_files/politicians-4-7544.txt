He kept the union together and was a man of great conviction. However, he did not fight the south for slavery issues primarily. He fought the south to keep the nation together. He realized that slavery was a hot issue and decreed the emancipation proclamation, in part, to appease the abolitionists of his day and to stop infighting that was going on in Congress and in many larger northern cities who favored the south leaving rather than dying four. History would have benefited, however from him serving two, maybe more, full terms. He was a great man. We need more like him.
