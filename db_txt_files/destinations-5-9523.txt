Big Ben and Parliament is set in an absolutely gorgeous, clean area of London. If you go there via the Jubilee Line, you get to see the Line extension which is so modernistic and huge! It doesn't take long to get to the Thames so you can see all the fantastic things on the South Bank (Book Market, theatre etc). Well worth it!
