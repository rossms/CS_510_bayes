What can I say? The bitch is no Madonna. Madonna's '80s (and several '90s albums) music is great. So was Cyndi Lauper's and a few other female divas. Britney Spears is cute, granted. I would copulate the bejeesus out of her virgin (yeah, right!) vaginal orifice. I may have to knock her out and rape her to accomplish that. But her music is subpar and this is a dumb album from a dumb woman who's only appeal lies in her looks and her quasi-okay dance moves -plagiarized from a Zimbabwean Mountain Gorilla of sorts...
