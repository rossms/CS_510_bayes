one hell of a hilarious and clever movie with a lot of gentle, sarcastic humor which revolves around a hilarious rivalry between two retired male neighbors. A fine mix of coemdy and drama, and just another great film by the elite team of Jack Lemmon and Walter Mathau- they were truly the first true Comedy Team . May they rest in peace.
