The one flaw that makes these restaurants not be excellent is that there is no dining inside- I had no car and I had to dine in the cold in Lexington, KY. What saves this good rating is that the food is very good and the Coney dog was the best I ever tasted. Service is A-OK and it is a decent chain. Hope there will be more in the west.
