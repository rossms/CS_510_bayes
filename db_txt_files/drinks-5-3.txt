I tell you its the best there is. Jus sit with your mates in a warm living room, laughing and cheering. If the devil came to me with this proposition "drink a beer, and i give ya ten more years to live" id reply "only if it be a guinness. Try it, try it a few more, then you'll love it. Well, im off to see about substituting blood for guinness!!!
