This is probably the most meaningful and intelligent music video ever done, and one of the greatest R.E.M. songs! The music video actually has a connection to the song, as opposed to everything else you see in music videos this day. It is creative and unique. The director of this video could really visualize what the song was all about. Watch this music video! It's worth it!
