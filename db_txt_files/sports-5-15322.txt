OK, this hurts cause he has beaten the crap out my Bears, but this guy is the best QB in the league right now. He took a lousy team to the playoffs last year. He makes everybody around him better. I think i could get 1,000 yards in a season with this guy throwin the ball to me. That said, I hate this guy.
