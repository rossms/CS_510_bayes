Bought a 2000 montana in spring of 2002.Have had zero trouble,gets excellent gas mileage,plenty of power,excellent ride and handling.Overall fit and finish,like any pontiac product is good,not great.Buy this van used not brand new (but with warranty)and you have a winner.Depreciate $10000 in first year.
