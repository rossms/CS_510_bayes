Among all cigarettes I have ever smoked, Basic has ben the worst. Once, because of its cheaper price I bought Basics. But let me inform you about my idea about Basic after smoking it; its tobacco doesn't taste aromatic to me. It doesn't always burn well and required re-lighting in some cases. Maybe the problem is the low quality tobacco.
