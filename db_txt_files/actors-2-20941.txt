I haven't seen this actress extend her acting abilities (oops...what acting abilities) other than these three shows. We should proabably give this babe a chance especially me of all people who gave Pam Anderson a 3! I'm not sute whether to count Baywatch but she still made it a cult phoenomanum while itb was on. She may be the cursed T.V. woman after being on two now-cancelled shows. Baywatch and the almost soap opera but worst show Titans The only thing saving her is her role on the modest hit, Nash Bridges. Her two stars come from that and ,hell, she's hot!
