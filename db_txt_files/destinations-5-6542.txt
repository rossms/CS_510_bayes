I just visited Texas for the first time, and I must say I felt right at home. I'm from Connecticut and would consider Texas like a second home. A friend of mine in Texas told me about southern hospitality, believe me Texas has plenty of it. The people and culture are great, the weather is a bit hot, but you get use to it fast. Local economey is thriving, Dallas and Fort Worth are great Texas cities. Bravo and thanks to a great state. The Texans made my stay enjoyable.
