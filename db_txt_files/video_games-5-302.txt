my second fav. after gabriel knight 3. this game is amaizing, the story is very good and takes many twists and turns which makes it constantly interesting, it's got alot of movies which is something i like in every game, but the riddles are the best. they're so varieted and unique that i never got bored during the game, and it was free of any annoying feature, and most importently it was allways clear what you need to do now unlike in some sierra games.
