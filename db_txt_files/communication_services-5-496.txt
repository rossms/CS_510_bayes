Have had alltel's service for about 5 years and I have never had a problem. I recently shopped around for better prices and service and I could not find anything that beat them. Use-approx 1200 min per month & a lot of traveling Cost- approx $40 per month Cust Service- excellent Coverage- excellent Complaints- none
