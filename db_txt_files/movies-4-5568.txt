Perfectly good movie with some great performances. Bogie was certainly never more sarcastic and loveable at the same time. Claude Rains as Captain Renault was funny and loyal. The ending was perfect and fit the movie well. But that doesn't mean it has its faults. Although Bergman is good, she seems to have the same expression on her face throughout the whole movie.
