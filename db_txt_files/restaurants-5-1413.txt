I've been a fan of Sonic for as long as I can remember. I do find however some are better than others. Our local Sonic IMHO is one of the best, does take up to 5 or 6 mintues to get the food but heck it's cooked when you order it not sitting there waiting on you. The new steak sandwich is AWESOME!!!
