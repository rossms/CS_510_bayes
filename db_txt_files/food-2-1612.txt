If the thought of sucking on a peach flavored candy doesn't want to make you throw up, then I must be mental or something. Jolly Rancher has been around for years, and they have not changed any of the flavors. There are not too many flavors, just the basics, except for stupid peach flavored candies that make me have gas.
