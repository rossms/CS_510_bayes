An excellent honest and upstanding man, people seem to forget that his job is not to be a pawn for the US, but calling him anti-american for not being a pawn is just completely uneducated about the reality of the world. His job is to lead an organization that unites the world and attempts to help the little guy getting screwed. He does a good job and has helped millions of people. If you disagree then send me a personal message.
