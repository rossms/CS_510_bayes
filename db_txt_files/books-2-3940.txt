This is one of those classics that anyone can become easily familiar with, as it is well under 200 pages in length in most versions. It is not shocking or very profound in today's environment. I could imagine why it made such an imprint in reader's minds in the mid 20th Century, but there is so much amorality in the world today that the book merely frustrates the average reader with its lack of epiphanies. In other words, a notable piece in the history of literature, but not an enduring classic by any stretch of the imagination.
