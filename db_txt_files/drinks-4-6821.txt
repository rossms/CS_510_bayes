I just went to a local bar and tried three anejo tequillas. I started with Patron- this had the best flavor, really creamy with a touch of vanilla, but it wasn't that smooth on the way to the back of the throat. Don Julio was 2nd. It didn't really have much flavor, but it was by far the smoothest tequilla I've ever had. Last was Chinaco - ouch! That stuff burns. I had two sips and that was enough for me.
