Orlando is the city in which I live, and I must say this is a great place or I wouldn't live here. There is nothing boring or stupid about it. Not only is the weather wonderful all year round, but the people are really nice here and they are so diverse, too. The job prospects are at a decent level, and it isn't all in the hospitality sector either. I mean of course Orlando is mostly a tourist city, but there are locals here, and alot of them. Orlando is an all-American city, and I am proud to call it home. :)
