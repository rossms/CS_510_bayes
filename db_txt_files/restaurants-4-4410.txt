Outback Rules! The place I go to when I want a steak from a national dining chain restaurant. The wait time is the only thing that gets me. It's a sign of how good Outback is though. Thumbs up and Five Stars. Outback's Prime Minister Prime Rib is the best!*****UPDATE***** Outbakc drops a star. They opened one up near me and I've been there twice for Curbside Take away. Both times my Prime Rib has been lukewarm to cold and not done on time.
