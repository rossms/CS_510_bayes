When the fisrt Syphon Filter came out, I locked myself in my room for three days straight. I was so excited when I saw the ad for the second. The play is the same as the first. A combination of skill shots and running and shooting. 989 studios has definitely bumped up the difficulty. My one problem with the game is a lack of level ending bosses in the earlier levels. I'm halfway through the game, and the keys to my room are jingling.
