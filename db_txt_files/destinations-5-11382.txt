Arches is one of my favorite parks. It has the most amazing rock formations that change color with the sun. It is a photographer's playground with color and visuals off the scale. You can hike around the park and look at the rocks but that is about the extent of the activity. In addition Moab is a cute town and there are a variety of outdoor activities in the surounding area. Slick rock, some of the most challenging mounting biking, and Canyonlands National Park are right down the road.
