This woman can do anything. Almost. First off, she can really sing (see Hole ). Plus I love that song Celebrity Skin. Second she can act but only if she plays characters like her. Man on the Moon was wonderful and The People VS. Larry Flynt wasn't half that bad. The only reason she gets four stars instead of the shebang is that she is a little sleazy.
