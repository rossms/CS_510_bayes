Over the course of his career we have seen Dustin Hoffman play many different characters. And, I think, that is what acting is all about. He can take whatever personality the writer dreams up, with whatever handicaps or wardrobe the story asks for, and when he plays the role, we believe him. That is the mark of a true actor. He is not portraying himself, or the same basic part, in every film. He is acting, and we believe it. Few people in Hollywood have ever done it better.
