There are far too many of these Chicken Soup books. The first was good, and deserved to be a big hit. But then they started putting out Chicken Soup for the Teenage Soul, for the College Soul, for the Sportsman's Soul, for this group that group, and before long it was like taking real soup and diluting it with water. This reminds me of what has been happening with the Bible lately. Instead of everyone reading the same one, we now have a Bible for Senior Citizens, a Bible for Teens, an African-American Heritage Bible, etc. Give it up already!
