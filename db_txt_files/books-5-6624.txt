Truly the best book I have ever read. It's scary, dramatic, funny, everything you could want in a book. You get really attached to the characters: Frodo, Sam, Gollum, Gandalf, Aragorn...and even though people say the female characters in the book are fake and 2-dimensional, I think Eowyn is one of the best characters. Also, the creatures and places are so realistic that you almost believe that this world really existed. A very very good book.
