Although a touching movie, too much of it just seemed way too unbelievable. How she was able to survive in a WalMart and eventually gain so much fame seemed far fetched, and I really don't understand why they kept following up with her ex. The actors made the movie fun to watch, though, and it makes me want to read the book.
