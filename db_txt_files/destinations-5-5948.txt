I really enjoyed my time in Alaska. Aside from the insects when you're in the backwoods it was a beautiful, fantastic trip. Denali was incredible. The trip in over the cliffside roads was awesome. Spent a lot of time in Valdez, drove up the coast from Canada and saw tons of wildlife. Definitely something I would do again.
