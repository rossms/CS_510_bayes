German Punk girl Lola has 20 minutes to raise 100,000 Marks and save her boyfriend from carrying out a bank robbery.A heart-pounding,vibrant techno-beat entertainment that's full of invention(director Tykwer includes animation and a range of eye-catching visuals,while taking the viewer on further circuits to reveal how things might turn out differently.)Perhaps not the deepest meditation on the importance of fate,but for an 80 minute adrenalin rush,it's well worth the trip.
