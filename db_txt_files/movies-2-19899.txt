3 times the charm? Uh,no. This is by far the worst entry in the Scream series.Why is this bad?? 1.Uninteresting characters 2.Everyone dies in the same way.The killer stabs someone in the back,a stab in the stomach,a gunshot etc... 3.The opening scene is rather weak if you compare it to the rest of the other two. 4.The ending was oh-so crappy blah blah blah
