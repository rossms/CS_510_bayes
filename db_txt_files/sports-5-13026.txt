Stanford, as we know, has always been a great school and had a great sports program such as swimming, baseball, basketball, and NOW football. I am so inspired by their great accomplishments from last year's season. I know that they are just going to get better. I mean, John Elway graduated from Stanford... they've always had great quarterbacks, running backs and defensive ends. I predict that they will be in the top 5 next season and be in the Rose Bowl!
