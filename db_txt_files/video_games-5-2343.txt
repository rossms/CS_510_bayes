Yes the PC version was better but given technology at the time Starcraft 64 is easilly the greatest non PC RTS game out there. Without the expansion pack the game was limited but I had the expansion pack and honestly the game is incredible, I spent uncountable hours whoopin ass, with every race on every race. I love the game and would recommend it to anybody and I haven't found someone who hates this game, and I hope I never do.
