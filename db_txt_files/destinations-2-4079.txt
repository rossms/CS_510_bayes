This city definately never sleeps! There is a lot to do in this city and there are excellent shows, waterparks, and casinos. I look at Las Vegas as a place to spend only a few days, it's fun to go every once in a while. I know I could never raise my children there and I would struggle with the high temperatures and the yucky tap water.
