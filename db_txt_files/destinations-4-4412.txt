Providence is an up and coming city. It has quite a bit of charm from the colonial neighborhood on Benifet St to the ivy league atmosphere at Brown University. It even has a it's own little Italy on Federal Hill which has number of great Italian restaurants and pastry shops. You can take a gondola ride on the river with flaming lamps rising above the water. Providence is a great little city with character and is enjoying a renesaince and it keeps getting better.
