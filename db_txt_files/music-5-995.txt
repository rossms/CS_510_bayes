Chris Cornell has come a long way in his life. Through everything he's done both musicaly and anything otherwise, has inspired me in a tremendous way. He is an incredible man and deserves a lot more praise than he is granted. Euphoria Morning is a great album because he has proved to everyone he alone can make it and no one can stop him. Honestly, this is the only cd i have ever listened to start to finish all the way through and i still love it time and time again 'Christina'
