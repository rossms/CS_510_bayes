The burgers and chicken sandwiches, for the most part, are fresher and tastier than the other places (BK, McD's). And, you get more healthy choices here than you do with competitors--the salads, wraps, and chili really do taste pretty good. It can get a little overpriced, but the 99-cent value menu helps. If you haven't done so yet, go pay tribute to Dave Thomas (a great American icon) and have lunch at Wendy's.
