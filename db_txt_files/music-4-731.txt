 I like a lot of the music on this disc. In the future tho I'd like him to concentrate more on the pop/rock and shy away from the dance/pop tunes. Lenny's always been a rocker and there's no real reason for him to change now. His top jams from each record have always been the funk/rock tunes (LLR,AOTR,AYGGMW,RnRID,FA), so he should stick with that and let Madonna do the dance stuff.
