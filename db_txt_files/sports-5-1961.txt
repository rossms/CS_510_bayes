The Boston Red Sox callin' the New York Yankees the evil empire? So f'n what Red Sox fans if the Yanks buy all the players? The Yankees do their talkin' on the field. 26 World Championships and 38 AL Pennants. Well, here's what I call the Red Sox: CLEVELAND BROWNS! Yeah, the Red Sox r a baseball equivelent of the Cleveland Browns: They choke in sport's biggest games. Bottom line baseball fans: THE YANKEES ARE THE BEST THERE IS, THE BEST THERE WAS, AND THE BEST THERE EVER WILL BE!
