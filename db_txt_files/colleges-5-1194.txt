Yale is without a doubt one of the best places to spend four years. I am a senior here. Yale is tough, intense, and can really give your self-esteem a good kick in the pants. But, its faculty and student body are not only brilliant but also deeply understanding, kind, profoundly comitted to everthing they do, and incredibly diverse. If you want to meet people who will inspire you to live life without regrets, come to Yale.
