Alex Rodriguez is one of the best players that are/ever played standing next to Mickey Mantle,Babe Ruth,Roger Maris, and Derek Jeter. I think that everybody who says he just wants a ring and he's only playing for the money....are wrong!Of course he wants a ring (wouldn't you?)And he is like the best baseball player(right now), wouldnt you pay him a lot?!
