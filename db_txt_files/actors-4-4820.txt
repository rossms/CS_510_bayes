I had not paid a whole lot of attention to Jamie Foxx until this year when he was in two impressive roles. One the cab driver who was forced to drive an assasin around and of course RAy. He was dead on perfect in Ray. he sure deserved that Oscar! A talented actor. I would look forward to seeing more of his roles.
