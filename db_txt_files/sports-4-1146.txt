Could be great....he hit the scene with last years postseason. Still, he finished up with what, a .267 AVG, grant it he moved around. I'm looking forward to watching him in 05. I don't expect 38 jacks, afterall, his previous best was 29. If he can keep the Ks under 100 he'll bring that avg back to 03 standards.
