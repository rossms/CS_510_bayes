The best island. Great food, check out Alan Wong's for truly amazing food. Watch the sunset from the Moana Beach Bar, the best bar on the beach. The north shore is great during the months of November & December, amazing waves. While up there make sure to have lunch at Kua Aina, great burgers. Waikiki is the very best spot for people watching. Check out the Mai Tai bar at the ala moana shopping center, best lemon drops I've ever had and you are looking at the ocean.
