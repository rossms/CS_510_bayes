Abercrombie Fitch, Aeropostale, and American Eagle are basically the same thing, so refer to my review of A F to get my opinion on this store. What really matters is that if you want a wide selection of clothing at reasonable prices at a mall store, you should shop at Old Navy. (And no, I don't work for Old Navy.)
