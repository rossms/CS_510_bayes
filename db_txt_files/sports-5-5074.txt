the greatest college player ever....averaged 27.1 a game when there was no 3 point line....and he could shoot from WAY back....greatest leaper of all-time 46 inch vertical, but dunking was illegal then....greatest scorer of all time, but freshman couldn't play----National player of the year Jr. and Sr. ---first team all american EVERY year(except freshman when they weren't allowed to play varsity) even MJ calls him the greatest....you guys that never saw him play are sick to not have him in the top 2 or 3 EVER! he was an entire notch above MJ in his NCAA years--ask either one of them.
