God, how sad it's for Mexico to keep a legacy of bad presidents. At the local level, people believe in a promise created by the Partido Revolucionario Institutional, PRI . They believe that a new president will do his duty. So, it seems that Zedillo did well to the nation, keeping up with NAFTA. But, has Zedillo thought about his people or just international commerce? I feel Mexican politicians like Zedillo are desperate to keep good relationships with the U.S. and sacrifice a lot, the nation, our people, our land.
