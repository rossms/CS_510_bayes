This is one of the best games I have ever played. I'm an RPG freak, so this was certainly my cup of tea. The story was complex, intriguing, and moving. The graphics were so unbelievable at the time it came out. Another thing I really love is the music. It fits so well, and it's enjoyable even while not playing the game (I've actually left the game running on my playstation on while I was in the room just to hear the music). The game is challenging, but not impossible (although those emerald and ruby weapons are darn close!). I could go on and on, but I'll spare you ;)
