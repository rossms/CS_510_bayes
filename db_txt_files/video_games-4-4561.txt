Let me just say this: I did not buy this game nor did i play. I checked it out in the store, thought it looked like it rocked, then came back the next day to buy it. I waited in line and finaly got up to cashier who told me you gotta PAY to play this game online, i thought that kinda sucked. So i'm just warning anyone who wants this game and doesn't want to pay to acually PLAY it after you spend enough money BUYING it (yeah so i'm cheap, but i'm also BROKE!) ..... don't buy it! Otherwise my friends tell me it's awsome!!
