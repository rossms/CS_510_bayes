Melissa Gilbert did an above average, nearly excellent (four-and-a-half star) job playing Laura Ingalls on Little House on the Prairie, but to me, the true encore performance of this show was the role of Mary Ingalls as played by the much overlooked Melissa Sue Anderson. However, I consider Gilbert to be one of the best child stars, and she got better as she grew older.
