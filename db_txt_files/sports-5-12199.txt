Matt Leinart could very well win the Heisman and go #1 overall in the draft but, he is not the best QB in college. Jay Cutler from Vandy is the best QB and will have the best career in the NFL,because Leinart will never have the talent around him he does now going to any team with the first pick. In closing Leinart wins the Heisman, Sucks it up in the NFL.
