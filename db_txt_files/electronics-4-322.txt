I have a Sony DVP-S330. Being that this was the third DVD player that I purchased in a 6 month time period, it has worked very well. Installation was kind of hard, but once running the quality has been great. There has been a couple of times that it shuts off in the middle of the movie. But it seems that this happens with only certain DVD disks. (Like rentals)Other than that, it's great!
