Rhode Island is a great place to live. Everything you will ever need is at your fingertips. Those who complain about the state are usually gruff outsiders and those who just couldn't make it there. I lived there for over 50 years and now live down south with the rednecks but I am down here because of the better, healtheir weather, not for the crude people who live here. I recommend Rhode Island to anyone who wants the urban life without the travel.
