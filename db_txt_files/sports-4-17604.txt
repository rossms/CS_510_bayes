With Kurt Warner lying about a fractured thumb and Marshall Faulk down for a few games, the Rams had a hard year. The bright point was the emergence of a solid backup, maybe even starter in Bulger. The ONLY reason the Rams didn't make a playoff run last year was because of the hack Mike Martz. The reason they lost the Super Bowl was because of idiotic play calling in the first half and fourth quarter. Losing Trung Candidate won't really affect the team like losing Az Hakim was. They need a solid 3rd receiver to step it up. Oh yeah, and get rid of Martz.
