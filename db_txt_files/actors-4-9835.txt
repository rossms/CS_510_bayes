She really is quite good. She was great in Pleasantville Freeway. I didn't much care for Cruel Intentions or Fear, but I think the writing and production were primarily to blame for that. She is beautiful in a very Southern way. It's kind of nice to see that in Hollywood. A friend of mine knew her when they were much younger and she tells me she's always been pretty cool and down to earth.
