Seeing as how Leelee is barely 20 years old, I don't believe that she's had all the acting experience required to be highly regarded amongst the cinematic eyes of the general public. Just give her time! I thought Leelee gave a promising performance in The Glass House though. Also, she's pretty to boot. Imagine Helen Hunt 60 years ago.
