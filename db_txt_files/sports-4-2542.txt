Hey alsport. Jeez, here's a nickel...go buy a clue. How the hell can Beane, Terry Ryan, et al. be accused of being overrated??? A few division titles you say...that's saying more than you can imagine. Building contenders from prospects and has-beens with a set budget is more than just a good start. The players' failures (A's had Sox and Yanks facing elimination) are not to pinned on Beane. Had the players closed it out, maybe we wouldn't be having this exchange (because the A's might have been World Champs)
