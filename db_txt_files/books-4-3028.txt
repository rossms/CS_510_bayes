This story plays very well as a novel, and in SOME ways is better than the Kubrick film. The characters, as always, are fleshed out very well and King's trademark insights into human behavior are in full force. This story about Jack, his wife and son spending a winter as the caretakers of an old hotel can spook you and terrify you. The creeping horror of it all sucks you in on page one. King was so much better in the 70s and 80s and althought it is average for that period in his career, it is still superior to 80% of the horror novels out there.
