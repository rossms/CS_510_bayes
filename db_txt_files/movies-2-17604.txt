Sorry for those who voted for my rating, but I have to change it. Apart from it's artistic and technical merits, I can't really say I liked the movie because I simply don't agree with the theology that it's based on. I'm sure the people who made it were well-meaning and were just hoping to prevent people from experiencing something negative, but I just don't agree with the whole premise. Like Pat Robertson, Hank Hanegraaff, and a few others, I believe the rapture will occur at the end of the Great Tribulation.
