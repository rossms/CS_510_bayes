I would give this an almost four. There are some pretty good short stories in this book. One of the Chicken Soup series I have read a few of these books and as the title says this one centers around being a mom. some of the stories are true others are fiction. As in most of the Chicken Soup books some of the stories are better than others. There were a few that got me choked up others wanted me to gag. this is a nice read for someone who does not want to get into a large novel and wants some quick reading.
