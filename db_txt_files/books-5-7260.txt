An outstanding book! I enjoyed reading this thoroughly, couldn't put it down. Few stories out there will move your heart. This one did! If you are a horse racing afficionado I would heartily recommend this. I learned a lot about horses from the author's descriptions. Even the story surrounding Seabiscuit from his trainer and owner all the way to his rider is rich and engaging. If you like sports (and horses) you won't find this book boring!
