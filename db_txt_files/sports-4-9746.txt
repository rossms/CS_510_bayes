One of the most underrated franchises in the NBA. Until this year, hasn't missed the playoffs since 1985. Jerry Sloan is a great coach, and nearly took his team to the playoffs this year when everybody picked them to finish last. With them having a good free-agency offseason, the Jazz Seem to be heading into a new era of success after losing Stockton and Malone.
