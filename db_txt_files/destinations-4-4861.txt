I was born in Idaho and i've been working in Miami for almost ten years. I've had to travel to several cities in Latinamerica, and Santiago is positively one of the bests. I think i'd enjoy to living there for a while. Great weather, cheap, safe, clean, gentle people, excellent commerce and services, etc. People and urban landscape are so different from Mexico City or Caracas (Venezuela), actually Santiago is much nicer.
