When I first read this book I thought it was pretty good. Maybe 3 1/2 stars good. However, I have almost completed the third book and my opinion of the entire series, and the author, have risen much higher. I will have to give it some time to digest after the next novel, but so far this is the *best* series I've read in a long time.
