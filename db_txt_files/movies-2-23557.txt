First off, the movie features Tom Cruise, who may be one of the hugest stars right now, but is almost always, putting the very best spin on it that I can, lackluster at best as an actor. The effects were ok, actually pretty impressive by mid 80's standards, but the sub-Tolkienian plot wasn't particularly good. I will admit that Tim Curry did a pretty good job as the satanic figure, but this is dross.
