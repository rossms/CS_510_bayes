I don't know what's with all the negative reviews but this lady has natural beauty only achieved by people like Charlize Theron. She's not that bad of an actress too. Although she could save the action flop 15 Minutes she has carried her show Providence to the top winning multiple awards for her work. I can't speak for her work on The Guiding Light since I'm not a big fan of soap operas but for what I've seen of her, she's definately four-star worthy!
