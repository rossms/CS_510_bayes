Wow! Is this meant to promote the song (which you couldn't get out of your head because it was played so often) or is it about how Kylie looks. I like the dancers with the red plastic around their head and the moves are very good. I don't think anyone will be forgetting that outfit for a very long time, the amount of men i've seen salivating over that....
