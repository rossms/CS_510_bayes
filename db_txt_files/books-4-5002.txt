It may be a little hard to read at first, but once you get the hang of it it's not so bad. Definately a clear-cut good vs. evil story, it's a shame I didn't get to read the ending (I read of Grendel and the undersea battle, but I believe there was supposed to be more to the story, like of the demise of Beowulf if I'm not mistaken . . . . I have to find a copy and read the whole thing through sometime). If anyone can find a copy of the book Grendel , it's supposed to be the story from the monster's point of view. It may be interesting for those who liked this story.
