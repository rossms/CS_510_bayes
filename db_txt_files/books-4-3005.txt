I've read this a couple of times and I'm always left thinking about it for days afterward. The real horror is that it could very well happen. The way reality shows are getting, I can see something like this being watched. Its in the same vein as The Running Man which was made into a very enjoyable movie. I'd love to see this book made into a movie too.
