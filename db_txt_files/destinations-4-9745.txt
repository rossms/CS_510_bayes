My taste buds like them, but my chest doesn't. Blend 27 tastes better than the Marlboro Lights I regularly smoke. Not as sweet. I have not decided whether to switch yet because these Blend 27's have much heavier smoke I am not used to. The are probably loaded with tar, which is bad. I have only had a couple of packs. I am going to make them my next carton, and then I'll see how it they feel after a couple of weeks.
