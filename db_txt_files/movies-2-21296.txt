This is one of the lamest Broadway musicals ever, a bland retelling of T. Wilder's The Matchmaker. Weak book and score. This film had good art direction and both W. Matthau and young Michael Crawford did good turns in it, but the flick was a turkey otherwise. Even though that godawful and only marginally talented B. Striesand is prime yenta action, she brought absolutely nothing to the role of Dolly Levi that could have been afforded by say, Peggy Lipton.
