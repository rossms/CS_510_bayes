one of the better young actresses working right now. The first thing i saw her in was Digging to China when she was very young she was good in that. She did a great job in Thirteen as the young teen who gets caught up with the wrong group of kids and winds up down a bad road of drugs and sex etc. She shows a lot of promise as and actor.
