KJ was a good shooter who could penetrate and, as The Dream discovered, take it over you if you are not careful. He got mugged at the end of the finals in '93 and no call happened. KJ got screwed in favor of a dynasty. Nice guy, too. He never said a thing publicly about it. He just thanked us for our support and kept playing.
