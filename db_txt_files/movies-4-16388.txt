This is a really good movie to see if you're looking for something different to see. I've never seen anything quite like Cruel Intentions before. Very unique and well acted by everyone. It's not for everyone though, it takes it to the limits and addresses topics which are still considered fairly taboo. If you're an open-minded person and you want to see something different then this is a good movie to go see.
