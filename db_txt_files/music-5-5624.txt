Appetite For Destruction..just great. This only recieves five stars because you can't go with 6, 10, or, as I would have it, 50. Oh, and just a thought:I saw several people mention songs not on A.P.F, or at least not on any version I've owned, November Rain and Patience being the two that come to mind right now. Some special edition or a mistake?
