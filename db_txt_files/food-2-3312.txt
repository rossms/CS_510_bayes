for a while i liked them, because of the price. but they taste nasty, the only thing i like is the brownie or the chicken nuggets. it just LOOKS nasty, with gross greases and juices, and i'm sure dishes such as the bbq rib (i love bbq rib, this is just sad.) or salisbury steak would qualify as dog food.
