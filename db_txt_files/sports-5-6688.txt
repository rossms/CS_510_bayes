The best coach in basketball. He understands the wisdom of restraint, at defining roles and goals, and giving players the confidence that all will flow toward the achievement of that goal. That style of leadership won the Cold War for Ronald Reagan and it (and MJ) won 6 championships for Phil Jackson!
