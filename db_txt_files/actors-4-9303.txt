I thought she was perfect in the role of the biggest 'psycho' fan in Misery. That was the first I had heard of her and since then I think she's continued to be impressive in everything she's done. She also seems very likeable as a person, at least from the interviews I seen of her but that's a pretty flimsy basis.
