This is the best drin kto get you messed up in under 3 minutes. I especially like 4 shots of this magic potion before watching any comedy movie. Try this (if you can keep it down) before watching any Adam Sandler movie. This drink also gives you an interesting buzz if you mix it with grenadine and a twist of lemon. Just remember to breath out after shooting, and I would also recommend a breathmint.
