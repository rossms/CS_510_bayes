Molfan's already done an excellent review of this absorbing, moving and superbly-acted drama,from director Arthur Penn (Bonnie and Clyde,Little Big Man,Night Moves..)concerning a deaf-blind girl whose parents hire a teacher to help her communicate.The subject i find of added interest as years ago i regularly visited a deaf-blind woman,whose resilience,optimism,ability and kindness never ceased to amaze me.German director Werner Herzog did an admired documentary on a woman living in this Land of Silence and Darkness ,but Penn's film,for me,is certainly superior.
