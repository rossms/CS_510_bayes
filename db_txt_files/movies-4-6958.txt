The question isn't "what are we going to do," the question is "what aren't we going to do?" I just saw this movie again last month and I still laughed so hard. This is a great flick that doesn't grow old, it's almost like an 80s cult classic. "Life moves pretty fast. If you don't stop and look around once in awhile, you could miss it."
