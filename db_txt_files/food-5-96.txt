Arguably this is the best of the lot. But, I m certain it will never make it to the top of the list because it s just not flashy enough. No sugar, artificial flavorings, or silly cartoon characters just something that is truly good and good for you. If you can t take it plain try dressing it up a bit with some raisins, honey, cinnamon or even a few chopped (unsalted) nuts. Just like your grandma said, this stuff will stick with you. It may also help some other things to keep from sticking with you like bad cholesterol.
