Have lived there, have visited many times. It really is a fine city. Compares well with Edmonton, Calgary (except for the proximity to the mountains!). The ball park is great, the forks are nice, Assiniboine park is terrific. Lots of good festivals, etc, and very good shopping! I would move back in a second. Hey aflx - I hear your point, but does that mean WPG deserves a 'terrible' rating - that seems very harsh and unjustified.
