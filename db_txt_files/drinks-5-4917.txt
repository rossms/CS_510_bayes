I grew up drinking RC Cola with peanuts then RC just disappeared. I'll never forget going to the store and picking up a bottle popping the cap and scratching the cork out to see if there was a RC diamond which you could redeem for a free drink. I've tried Coke and Pepsi with peanuts but neither comes close to the smooth sweet taste of RC. Now I'm hooked on the new glass bottled ones which are much better than the plastic. (I don't know why) I hope they keep them around for a long time. Long live RC Cola.
