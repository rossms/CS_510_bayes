Scary, scary, scary football team. It's hard to argue that this Steelers is not the best team in football after watching them thump the previously undefeated Pats and annihilate the undefeated Birds. I'm not seeing too many weaknesses in this team - other than the fact that Roethlisberger has to come back down to earth eventually.
