These guys were AWESOME while they were with Mercury! this is based on their 80's stuff. THEIR SONGS ROCKED (Blackout, No One Like You, Rock You Like a Hurricane, etc..) I give them a perfect 5 because these guys have alot of potential, they just don't use it like they should. these guys are very awesome!!!
