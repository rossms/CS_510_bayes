While I understand that it is unlikely that he will be able to topple Gore and his political machine, I am a big fan of Bradley. He seems to be so earnest and caring, truly believing in his plans. He's incredibly smart and I just trust him. Plus, the more I watch his debates with Gore, the more I like him and the more I dislike Gore.
