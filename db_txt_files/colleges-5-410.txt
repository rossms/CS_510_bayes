5 Star rating for a 5 Star school! Lancaster is one of the world's best kept secrets- great teaching, diverse and interesting students (high international bias and a good gender mix), a small cohort which allows great networking and socialising, a dedicated and friendly support staff, all set in a beautiful country setting. What more could you ask for! Students apply theories that are unique to Lancaster which go far beyond the standard practise of apply a model and everything will be alright , an approach that is not appropriate for the modern world. Great course and great value for money!
