A great car indeed. The Vette has always been the car to outclass the Mustang, it's a damn shame they stopped making the Camaro z28 and ss those are spanking the Mustang also, it's just the Vette did it with even more class. You People who say, the company who made the chevette, keyword made, not make anymore. But Ford still make the Ford Focus and Ford Taures, and what was that other great car they made the Ford Fiesta, lol..... Every car company make a few Pieces, but just about every Ford is a piece so you might just wanna keep you mouth shut.
