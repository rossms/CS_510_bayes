This is the first cigarette I smoked, and still my favorite. There is nothing negative to say about these things, nothing. The taste is great, smoothe, not too too expensive. Just thinking about these makes my mouth water. I recomend these to anyone, anywhere. Smoke Camels. Drop your Marlboros and pick up a REAL Cigarette.
