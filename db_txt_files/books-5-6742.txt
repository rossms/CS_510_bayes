This book/series of novels is just down-right hilarious. It is so off-the-wall funny it will keep the reader jumping from pageto page unable to put it down. Even the caption on one of the novels in that series is hilarious the fourth novel in the Hitchhiker's trilogy . I would recomend any odd-book-reader to pick this or any other one of Douglas Adams' books up.
