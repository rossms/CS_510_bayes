The spicy chicken fillet sandwich is the best I've ever had out of all the fast food chains. They actually use real chicken, not so with McDonalds, Burger King, and Hardees, who use pre-formed chicken, which tastes like cardboard. The only other restaurant that comes close to Wendy's spicy chicken is Arby's, and coincidentally, they don't use pre-formed chicken either.
