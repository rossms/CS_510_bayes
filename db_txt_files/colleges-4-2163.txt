The classes are enjoyable for the most part, and I've loved every professor I've had. They all know my by name and make the effort to see that every student understands the material. If it weren't for those to factors, I would not be attending Miami as the people aren't exactly desirable. Some people are scared off by the amount of attractive, unfriendly students there are, but I prefer to think of them as cartoon characters. They help me get through my day with a smile.
