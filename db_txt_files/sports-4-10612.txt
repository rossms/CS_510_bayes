Cmon guys, anything more than a 4 is just homerism, plain and simple. I know for a fact 99% of the DawgNation feels like we underachieved last season. Sure, Richt has brought solid recruiting and a more balanced, higher amount of success but we still haven't exactly achieved greatness yet, and the discipline thing might not be as good as we once thought it was. IMHO 2003 was his best coaching year by far with that OLine... good guy, but not perfect. Gets a four and I would understand 3's...
