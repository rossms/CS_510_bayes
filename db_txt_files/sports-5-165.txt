Anyone who doesn't give Vlad, the best player in the game today a 5 simply doesn't know the game of baseball. If he played in Boston or New York he would be number 1 on this list. Ask any NL pitcher who they fear the most, and 90% will say Vlad Guerrero, you simply can' pitch to the guy. Not to mention he has the best arm in the game, and plays outstanding defense.
