I went this spring break with 9 of my girl friends and it was FABULOUS!! The only way i can describe that week is...out of control! My only complaints are the food (except hooters...it's great) and having to pay $40 to get into a club with an open bar but only being able to get a drink if you tipped the bartender. That's not open bar. Beautiful place with fun people!! I would recommend it to anyone looking to have a good time!! Just make sure you don't lose your credit card and ID like i did....
