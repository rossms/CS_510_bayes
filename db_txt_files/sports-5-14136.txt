Perhaps the greatest player of all-time, Jim Brown was definitely the greatest running back ever. Blessed with power, speed and overall skills, Brown was a threat in every game he ever played- whether he was injured or not. Jim Brown had heart, and once played a game with a broken bone. Moreover, Brown was durable as he never missed a game in his entire career. He was, at the very least, truly one of professional football's all-time greats.
