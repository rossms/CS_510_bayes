not that bad of a system- i work for a game company as a character animator- we are producing an xbox title and ps2 version - the ps2 can only handle about 1,500 poly character- and the xbox is 4,800. i believe the game cube can handle about 3,000 so it better than ps2 for sure- only reason we are producing for ps2 cause it dominate the market one sales - i have a GC my self.. not bad of system. i give props to xbox for its power. PS2 is okay and game cube is good cause it has better multi player games. oh yeah squaresoft is coming back to nintendo to do some titles too. :o)
