Ralph Nader is a compassionate candidadte for president. I will not waste my vote on Bush or Gore. i feel that they are both the same. It is all about money and power. they have no compassion!!!! Nader believes in the Right of Return!!!! They obviously (Gore Bush) are against it. I SAY VOTE NADER!!!!
