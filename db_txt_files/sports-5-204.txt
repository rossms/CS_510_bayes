Pedro is the most incredible pitcher I have ever seen. There's nothing more exciting then when he is one pitch away from striking out the side in Fenway. The atmosphere in the park is indescribable. He is one of the few reasons that I think I will still watch my beloved Sox next year when they stink it up.
