I liked it mainly because it had the theme of BELIEVING. The storyline was based on the fact that there IS divine intervention (God can heal or do anything) and there is no such thing as coincidence. Mel Gibson and the cast did very well. I'm not into aliens, so this was a decent film about them I guess. It was suspenseful and leaves you at the end with the feeling that you can believe.
