My mother brother introduced me to these teas. Very aromatic, reminiscent of a number of aromatic teas I drank in Germany, where the trend is towards teas like Prince Vladimir. Strong but smooth flavor. I typicially put some honey and a drop of milk in my tea, and they agree well with the Kusmi teas.
