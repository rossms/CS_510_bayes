Chunky's great! It's actually a soup that doesn't skimp on the meat and I don't see where that should be a complaint. If you don't like meat, eat vegatables! This soup is great for people who want a little bit of everything in a meal but don't have time to cook. Most of the flavors are real good, try the steak and potatoe
