Anyone that says George W Bush is not a great man and a great President has to be either completly retarted or a Liberal but there is not much difference. You can say what you want about Bush but I take him for his word and I do not believe he would ever lie to the american people unlike the last creature that occupied the white house. I can go to bed feeling safe because he is in office and not that loser Gore. All you liberals please stick to what your good at, KILLING BABIES AND PROTESTING EVERYTHING IN AMERICA.
