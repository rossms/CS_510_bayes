Drew Barrymore is terribly overrated. I don't think she is all that great of an actress. To be honest it seems to me that her acting has gotten worse as she became an adult. Her best acting was done as a child. She just seems to act so immature in many of her roles now, those who don't know her would probably think she is a teenager instead of a grown woman after watching one of her recent movies.
