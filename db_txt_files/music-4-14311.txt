Phantom is not in my top five Broadway show list, but it is still worth listening to. The music is actually rather good, and Michael Crawford does superbly as the Phantom. Sarah Brightman grows on you, depending on your mood. ^.' Personally, the strings in this musical always get me- beautiful. Lovely musical.
