Howard is absolutely the best rookie i have seen in a long time. He does a great job getting the Magic the ball back from his rebounding. His career high in rebounds is higher than Michael Jordan's for crying out loud! He also does a great job playing defense, especially with all his blocked shots. He sure impressed me for a guy coming out of high school. There is no limit to how much potential this guy could possess in the next few years.
