Jville Beach was rather desolate. It is prettier than Miami Beach because there is more nature. The sand in MB is better because it is smooth and the water's warmer. Going to the is beach involves more than just looking at the water and birds. I was there in 2001 and I notice that everything shuts down early and there was only 1 nightclub/bar in that area. Your better off going to the Landing.
