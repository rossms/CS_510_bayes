I have seen Wariick push a pile to be so short but he isn't as great as some of the others simply b/c he doesn't meet the challenges of a great defensive team.But he is a great back who is elusive and a power that can bowl even the greatest to the ground.He is quick as Mike Vick but hard to knock down like Jerome Bettis.
