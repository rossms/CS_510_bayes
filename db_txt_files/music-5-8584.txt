God I love this video! Seeing as I'm in Ireland and we only just got the video on the music channels all of you stateside are going to have to forgive me if this topic is a bit dated. Everything about the video is pure class. You've got Kelly looking absolutely stunning, flashback sequences, a dark and moody setting, rain, gothic forest, a doomed wedding, and a fantastic song... what else could you wish for?!!
