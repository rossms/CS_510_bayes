Love it, love the small curd, regular cottage cheese, HATE yogurt, but, I have to agree with another rater, the Darigold CC is way too runny, needs to be drier, and I won't buy it if that is all that is available in the store. They need to fix that runny problem they have. Good in the summer with fruits, with salads, and just with toast for breakfast, but needs to be cold.
