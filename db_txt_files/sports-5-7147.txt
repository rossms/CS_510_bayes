Mike defines basketball. There was nothing he couldn't do. Mike was the key ingredient in the Bulls dynasty. The two years he retired to play baseball, the Bulls only made it to the first round of the playoffs and lost. Even with all the talent (Pipper, Rodman, Divac) and the supposed great coach Jackson, they couldn't win a championship without Jordan. As soon as he returned, BOOM, three more championships. Now with the wizards playing his swan song, h can still pull off a 45pt. game here and there. It will be hard for anyone to top Jordan's legacy.
