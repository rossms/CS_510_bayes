Well. Everquest is quite addictive yet it lacks quite a bit. 1. Conflict and a workable pvp system, i'm sorry but there are HUGE imbalances in the pvp system. 2. No point to the game other than getting loot and camping spawns. personally i hate the variety of game that is just a huge leveling treadmill and it's sad that many fall to this game. the story is not what you would call great either. If you prefer an ever evolving world that focuses on story and gameplay then i'd recommend waiting for shadowbane to be released.
