In terms of OVERALL academics, only Harvard, Yale, Princeton, and Stanford can beat it... with Cornell/Columbia coming close. Chicago lacks engineering, Berkeley lacks an undergraduate college as strong as their grad schools, and CalTech MIT lack humanities. Johns Hopkins has it all. I highly recommend this school to anyone.
