I think they should delete all the 2000 and earlier submissions. Hyudai has totally redesigned this car from the ground up and they have finally hit the nail on the head. This is the third Tiburon since its inception in 1999 (they come out every other year). The GT V6 has the acceleration, handling and feel of a $40K sports car and has an excellent Infinity sound system. I like the dual shifting (that hardly any American car has). What I sorta like most is the looks I get, hardly no one knows what the hell it is :) My only dislike is the gas mileage, but hey, it is a V6 after all.
