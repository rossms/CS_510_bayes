(The 4 stars is meant as a neutral rating; the current average is 3.98 as I write.) What the commenters who urge you to plan ahead haven't said is that there are BOOKS on the subject, with detailed advice and maps, aimed at different kinds of vacationers (sometimes within the same book). You can check your local library's catalog and/or a librarian, or go to a good bookstore. I rather enjoyed reading the one or two I've seen, even though I don't intend to go in the foreseeable future (and never have gone, unless you count Epcot Center)--which is why I'm trying not to alter the park's rating much!
