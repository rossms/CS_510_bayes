Ties as my favorite card game with Egyptian Rat Race. It's especially fun with a large group of people and more than one deck of cards. Warning: use cards you aren't afraid to destroy. Also, don't be afraid to fight for your spoon... it makes it all the more intense, and I've had many proud welts to prove it, lol. Avoid using knives or other sharp objects as replacement spoons. P.S.: As a veteran Spoons champion, I find that metal, or otherwise heavy, spoons work best because the cards don't move them and they generally stand out from any floor or card deck.
