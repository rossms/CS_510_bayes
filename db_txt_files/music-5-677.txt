masterpiece!!! reznor knows about dark hurt and anguish and has so many ways to get them out. i've had this album for about 7 months now and was sorta reluctant to get it but i finally gave in. it grew on me big time!!! all the songs are a** kicking!!! superb!!! even my girlfriend listensto it and she doesn't even listen to anything hard. her comments: wow!
