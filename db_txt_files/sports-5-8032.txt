I think Allen Iverson is the best player in the NBA. I think some basketball players are jealous of him because he has won the MVP Award,etc. I think people judge him on his tattos, the way he dresses, and when he cusses during a game when he gets mad. All I want to say is Don't playa hate , Appreciate.
