I go the seattle campus and in the CIS program and agree the that school is expensive. However, for the courses that are critical for my career are hard core. Don't plan on having a life if you are going to school and having a job. They have helped a couple friends find jobs and internships.. there are some who hate the school and some who love it... as for me, I know I wouldn't get the same education anywhere else
