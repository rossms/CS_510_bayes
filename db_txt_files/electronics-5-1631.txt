JVC AV-27150 Excellent buy! For a $400 TV, this is a real bargain. I had some problems with Sony flat-screen TVs so I took this JVC instead. I was VERY surprised when I realized that picture quality is practically the same as on a flat-screen! Clear picture, rich colors - the only difference is that this is not a flat tube! PIP is great, remote is a bit big, but still - much better than Sony's. Sound of this TV is better than on a Sony Wega (same size). There are more video inputs than I'll ever need. Overall - I definitely recommend this TV!
