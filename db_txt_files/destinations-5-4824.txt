Buenos Aires can be european but S o Paulo is the economic city of Latin America. Enormous, with a strong cultural side, beautiful museums. New modern comercial towers are being build making it the most modern city of L.A. S o Paulo is the place in L.A. where you find all the books and CDs you want, all kind of restaurants, etc. Argetinians love to say they're whiter than Brazilian but the truth is that while Argentinians are always spanish or italians, Brazilians are Portugueses + Italians + Germans + Polish + French + Swiss + Africans + Japaneses making it a much more diversified country.
