I really liked S.F.W., a role he was perfect for, but any remaining respect I had for him vanished when I saw Cecil B. Demented. That had to have been the worst piece of cinematic excrement I have ever seen (next to Reality Bites). I would have turned it right off but I have a thing for Maggie Gyllenhaal.
