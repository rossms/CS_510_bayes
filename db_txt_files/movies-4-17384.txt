German films tend to be about as much fun as a tax audit. This one is good. . .a film that doesn't run in linear time. . .something that the morons in Hollywood wouldn't dream of let alone film. One of the more original films I've seen in the past three years. Movie buffs and film students will probably make sure this film becomes a cult hit. It's exciting, clever, sexy, and has good music.
