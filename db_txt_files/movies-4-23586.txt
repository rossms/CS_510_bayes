 So all day long, the noise of battle rolled...among the mountains by the winter sea..until King Arthur's table, man by man, had fallen in Lyonese byside their Lord.... a classic King Arthur tale, very closely parallels Le Morte D'Arthur . The casting, acting, and cinematography is excellent, but as usual, trying to cram the story into a limited time makes for gaps in the storyline, which is the bane of every storyteller. Excellent job by John Boorman..
