I found this bottle of wine in my wine rack which must have been given to us by a client. I opened it up to share with 2 other people and it was just exquisite-the best Pinot Grigio wine I ever tasted (& I don't even like Pinot Grigio that much). When I went to look for this year 2003 bottle i realized it wasn't a cheap bottle of wine by no means - about$21.00/bottle. I think I will buy a couple of bottles but save them for special occasions.
