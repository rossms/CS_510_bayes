I admire the job he has done, but I feel very sorry for him. He looked like a genius from 1998-2000, but now he has a chip on his shoulder. He's doing all he could to bring the Yankees back to glory. Unfortunately, being a Yankee GM isn't a powerful position because he has to look behind his back at you know who!
