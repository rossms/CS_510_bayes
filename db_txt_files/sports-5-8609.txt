I think Kobe Bryant is the most talented young basketball player that I have seen. We here a lot of negative comments about him and his attiude. We as Americans must remember to stop judging people and stop with the negative feedback. Everyone has a bad day every once in a while. Kobe, Keep the faith and continue to accomplish great things in life. Always remember your fans love you, but God loves you more.
