Very pretty. Everything is top notch. (e.g. science and athletic facilites) Everyone is super nice and there isn't a lot of elitism as compared to some of the other schools. Even though it isn't as well known as some of the larger schools, this hidden treasure attracts some very smart and nice people. More interestingly though, the student body is very good looking. Quite odd how that worked out.
