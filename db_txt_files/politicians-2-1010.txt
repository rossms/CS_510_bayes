A war criminal the Eisenhower administration (!) wanted to see arrested for his killings of Arab villagers. Would have made a great leader of SS anti-partisan operations. As crooked as Nixon, Harding and LBJ put together, yet unbelievably durable in politics. As much as I dislike him, though, he's the first Israeli leader to make meaningful progress toward giving up some of his country's ill-gotten territorial gains. However suspect his motives, it's progress.
