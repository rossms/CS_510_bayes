The one Southern state that i enjoy spending time in. Not even exclusivly in New Orleans, which i think is a dump. I really don't like the accent they speak with, but it is very unique. I like some cajun food and the overall funness of the place. The people there seem like they are always enjoying themselves. It's a nice place to visit. Could never live there not in a million years though. It is way too humid their all the time, and the bugs are bigger than rats lol. To rate the crazy cajun accents, and others, also see the american accents weblist.
