blacks are by far my favorite kind of clove. i know that there are plenty of kinds that arent even sold in the u.s., but just the smell of a black gets me excited. there have been times when i smelled a clove burning down the street, and had to go buy a pack. although they are very good, they cannot be my main cigarette. too many cloves and my throat burns and i cough up blood. i stick with marlboro menthols most of the time, but i like to get a pack of blacks every week or two
