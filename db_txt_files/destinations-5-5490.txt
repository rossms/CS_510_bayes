Hartford is in fact in the process of rebuilding- and despite what some say- it has a prime geographic location - that many other cities would envy. To judge the whole state on the basis of Hartford is without merit. A visit to the shore, the peaceful northeastern 'quiet corner' or the northwest hills would seem to make a rating of 1 rather silly for this old and very distinquished state. Try visiting Yale in New Haven, or perhaps the British Museum of Art. I have spent time in this state- and despite the problems of Hartford and some other cities- it does not rate a One.
