Newports are the best cigarette ever made, i do jump between Marlboro Reds and Newport 100's, but my main brand is the Newports, they have the best taste that I have found in a cigarette. When choosing between the kings and the 100's the reason i like the 100s is because the taste is better and they are much stronger.
