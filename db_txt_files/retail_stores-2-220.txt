I have been a regular customer of Banana Republic for years. However, the quality and style of the clothing has diminished while the prices only get higher. I live overseas often forced to order online. The shopping where I live isn't the best. If anyone out there knows of any websites for ordering cool clothes for a young professional in his late twenties let me know.
