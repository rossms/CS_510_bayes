I think ratings are incorrect for this catergory because we are into 2005 and windstar no longer exists after 2004. However, I own a 2003 (last model of windstar) and it runs wonderful! Even its engine sounds nice than chysler of the same year! I guess I am lucky... Ford isnt that bad as long as they are ironing our the bugs and insurance on ford is much cheaper! a money wise!
