Saw Vertical Horizon at a music festival locally, and subsequently ran out and bought the CD. Lots of great sing-along anthems. They're coming back to my town in August with Third Eye Blind and I enthusiastically bought tickets. This is a fun CD to listen to and the lyrics are just vague enough to make them applicable.
