This was a cute movie. I saw it in the Theaters when it came out. the film introduces Dil, Tommy's new baby brother who gets more attention than tommy did before Dil came. Tommy wants to take dil back to the Hospital but accidently ends up in a spooky forest. The parents find out that Dil and the others are missing and start a search party. Soon Tommy and Dil get along. A good film for any Rugrat fans.
