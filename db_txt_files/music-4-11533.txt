A solid, solid CD. The first couple of tracks are great, and the rest will grow on you. Definitely a CD that you can throw in and listen to the whole thing. I especially like the melding of reggae, punk, and lot of other genres. How had I not heard of this band earlier? And what a shame that they are no more...
