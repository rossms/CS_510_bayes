I'm almost ashamed to rate this teen flick so high but in comparison to its teen counterparts, it's really special. Mandy Moore plays an angsty, confused teenager with aplomb with grace on screen and a knack with delivering lines. Although the rest of the cast falters a little, Alison Janney is wonderful as her divorcee mother. The script is tender without falling into too much sentimentality, and understands difficult situations without becoming self-serving. Yes, at some parts it lags and feels a little awkward, but surprisingly Mandy Moore's fresh talent pulls the film through it.
