There are still rumours about Monica Lewinsky, but Bill Clinton is an effective president. America did do well under him and America obviously voted him back in for a reason. He probably did better with the military than Bush did and the national debt under him did not explode, at least compared to Bush's spend-thriftiness. The only sour point is the Monica Lewinsky affair and his impeachment but other than that-no real faults.
