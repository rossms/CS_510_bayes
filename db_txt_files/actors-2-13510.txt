i think Kate Hudson proves the rotten apple doesnt fall far from the tree. proving she has the ability to be a half-way decent actor, Hudson took whatever budding credibility she had and poured it into projects like: How to Lose a Guy in 10 days, and Raising Helen. Two Oscar calibur films if i do say so myself.
