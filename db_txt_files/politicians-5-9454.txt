It is sad to say that William Henry Harrison died after only one month in office. He was a kind, warm hearted man that just wasn't very healthy. I belive that he had diabeties at the time, and he made a speech, and because he was so poor, and the weather was so bad, that he got an amonia and he lived for exactly one month, and then suffered a bad night, unable to breathe and finally died on hsi way to the hospital.
