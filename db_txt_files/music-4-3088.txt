As indicated by the stars, this is a good album. It also the most overrated Young platter around. Better Young efforts include LIVE RUST, EVERYBDY KNOWS THIS IS NOWHERE, COMES A TIME, AFTER THE GOLDRUSH ZUMA, oh, and you could probably throw in RUST NEVER SLEEPS WELD. Guest vocals from James Taylor Linda Ronstadt(ugh). Features Old Man, Heart Of Gold Needle And The Damage Done.Lacks the usual energy and intensity of a Neil Young record.-- Johnny Roulette
