I'm a senior at SDSU. I know most folks would say it's more of a cow college than anything, and they may be right (after all, it's a land-grant agricultrual institution first and foremost). But we're much more than that. We have world-class pharmacy and nursing programs, improving language arts programs and competitive athletics. The ladies' basketball team won a D-II national championship in 2003, and we are now D I-AA in football and D-I in all other sports. A step in the right direction.
