 I respect that they dont hide the fact that the food is bad for you. They straight up admit it. There are no JIBS here in PA but I have connections in AZ which bring me there about 3 times a year. So, when Im in the Phoenix-Tucson area Im pigging out at a Jack In The Box. I dig the Sourdough Burgers.
