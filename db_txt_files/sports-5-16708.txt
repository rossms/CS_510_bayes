Wow. Great record, first place in the AFC Central, and they're buried below the likes of the Cowboys, Bills and Lions... Tough league I guess. Steelers have been my favorite team for over twenty years and I could not be happier with their current success. I hope they have a good run in playoffs. I'd like to see them win another Super Bowl one day, though I doubt this is the year. Let's go Steelers!
