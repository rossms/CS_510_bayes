Always loved this store, but just one question- what's with the sizing? I swear, Queen Latifah would wear a size 4 here. Who do they think they're kidding? We don't need to be finessed into shopping here by telling us we're a smaller size. Your quality clothing is enough, Ms. Taylor. Go back to honest sizes. We'll still buy. Promise.
