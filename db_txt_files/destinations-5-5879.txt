New Jersey is probably the state that gets the most fun made of it, and yet deserves it the least. The proximity to New York City and Philadelphia is a marvelous benefit; the state's beaches rival any other beaches in the northeast; it has several fun towns like Hoboken; and the forests in the north are beautiful. Very underrated.
