Though I wasn't alive in the 50s, I was interested in the 50s when this movie came out. I refused to see it at first. I was sick of the silly, inaccurate TV and movie portrayals of the 50s that were popular just before that. But I kept hearing about it so I finally went and saw it just to get it over with. Not only did Spielberg pay great attention to detail and history, but this was just a great, fun and inspiring movie. It is now one of my all time favorites. The sequel was convoluted. The third of the trilogy was better than the second, but still nowhere near as classic as the first.
