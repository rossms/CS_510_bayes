seriously i absolutely love skoal... i started off doin berry gave me a good feeling but i quickly got sick of it so i turned to vanilla then now im currently in love with apple.. i mean once in a while a good straight dip or some redman is nice but when push comes to shove i would rather get cancer through apple... by the way does neone know what the next flavor is gonna be
