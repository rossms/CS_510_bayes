 Practically perfect in every way is how I'd describe Canada Dry Ginger Ale. If you're not going for caffeine, it's the ideal soft drink. I like its light, refreshing taste, and it's not too sweet. For some reason, I always order Canada Dry when I'm flying, and it really hits the spot. The cranberry-flavored version is great, too.
