Very interesting series. Comparing Sword of Truth to the Wheel of Time: 1. WoT has more sense of direction than SoT. While Goodkind seems to be lost, Jordan is merely stuck. 2. SoT is more entertaining than WoT. WoT books, though more solid, are never as exciting as Wizard's First Rule or Stone of Tears
