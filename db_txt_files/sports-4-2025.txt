Have had some of baseball's greatest teams and some of their worst squads ever ( same with players- some of the greatest and some of the very worst) in their long and interesting history in 3 different cities. It remains to be seen how they'll turn out in the near future, they're kinda in flux, but they're usually a contender of late.
