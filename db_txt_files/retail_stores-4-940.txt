i love abercrombie...except sometimes you have to check your wallet to make sure that its not going to blow up on a piece of clothes that says ABERCROMBIE on it...its kind of hard to find something that doesnt make you look like a billboard advertising them. and i must admit the ripped pants thing? why not just go to old navy and rip their pants? geez...
