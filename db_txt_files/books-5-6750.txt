Douglas Adams was a comic genius when it comes to writing smart, sci fi fun. I'm so upset that he died at such a young age (at age 49 about 2 months ago) and I won't get to enjoy anymore of his works like the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy. Marvin the Paranoid Android is so amusing, and you just can't help but feel bad for Arthur. Some of his jokes are subtle and it's nice when you feel like you're in the elite few that get the scientific references. Full of surprises and irony. And remember, the answer to Life, the Universe, and Everything is 42!
