At 6 feet 9 inches in height, I needed a car that was reliable, fuel efficient for over 100 mile round trip per day commutes, and affordable. After 16 test drives, I chose an Echo. You can't beat the gas mileage and the sticker price. Yeah, it's not the prettiest vehicle on the road but I appreciate the extra 2 inches of head room. If you're a tall person, take an Echo for a drive. You'll be surprised.
