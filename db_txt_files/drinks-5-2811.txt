i'm hooked on the french vanilla flavored coffee. i've tried other brands and generic and none of them compare to gfic's. i just wished there was some way to get coupons, i buy at least 20 + cans every two months or so. i drink it all day everyday. it keeps me from eating cakes, cookies, etc. please more coupons!!!
