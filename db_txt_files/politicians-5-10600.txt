It's amazing what people think a President can do (or not do) in about 3 months. Already, Woliwol is blaming Bush for the return of the Cold War and the world's pollution problem. I guess all throughout the 1990's there weren't any polution problems or any rogue nations. Wow, Bush is really powerful.
