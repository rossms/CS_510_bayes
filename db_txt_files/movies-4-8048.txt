When my cousin brought this dvd over to the house, my thinking is that I'm not going to enjoy this chick movie. I figured it was one of those run-of-the-mill-Julia-Roberts-romance-movie-wanna-bes. I was very glad to be wrong about that. It's a thoroughly enjoyable comedy, and my reason for liking it is that it's not in your face. The comedy comes from the quirkiness of the characters and the on-target observations of Greek family life. Also, everyone who was in the movie seems to be having a blast, and that ALWAYS carries over to the enjoyment of the person who is watching it.
