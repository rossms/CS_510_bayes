I can't blame the Quebecois for being xenophobic, but in the 21st Century, enough is enough! The Canadian Government is bending over backwards toward the Francophones. What is sad is the educational damage that the PQ Governments did to the Anglophone children by prohibiting English instruction. That is attempted genocide, and is the same thing the Quebecois decried about the British colonial governments.
