Granted, Metallica hasn't put out any original releases in a while, but that doesn't mean that this CD doesn't rock! If there's one thing Metallica knows is playing a live cncert. The symphony puts in their own twists to these classics and some not so classics....but still enjoyable. Michal Kamen is one of the most famous composers ou tere wrking with such act as Aerosmith (when they didn't sell out completely), Metallica 'Nothing Ele Matters,' and Guns N' Roses 'November Rain.' The CD and the DVD will delight any Metallica fan, old or new, and any headbanger out there with a taste for the different.
