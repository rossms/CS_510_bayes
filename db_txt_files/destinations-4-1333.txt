Germany is a surprisingly urban, industrial, dirty country. The urban areas are well organized, but dirty, smogy cities. Germany is the industrial powerhouse of Europe and it shows! Driving in the Autobahn is quite an experience. You're driving down the road going at 120 miles per hour and you still have people passing you. Bavaria and the Rhine River valley is the most beautiful part of the country.
