I could be happy eating at Wendy's seven days a week. Three days of chicken sandwiches, three days of burgers, and one day for a wild card: baked potato, pasta bar, or any of the other unusual fast food that pops up. And whatever you do, don't forget the Frosty. I get a little overloaded when I go for a regular-sized Frosty, so the key for me is to order a little kid-sized mini-Frosty - just enough to top off a double burger with french fries. McDonald's may have the best fries, but there's no question that Wendy's has the best burgers.
