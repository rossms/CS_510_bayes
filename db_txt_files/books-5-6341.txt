Some moron said in his review of this book that Rush is too cowardly to debate a live human being . Huh? He's had a politically oriented radio show for almost 20 years (counting his local Sacramento career) and debates with naysayers every day of the year. Like him or not, I've heard plenty of callers take issue with him LIVE on the show. In any case, this book is wonderfully funny and is loaded with common sense truths for those of us who tire of the doom gloom liberal mantra. The book is dated now since it was published in the early 90s but is still worth reading.
