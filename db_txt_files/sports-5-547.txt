I get the feeling that even in his own backyard Derek Jeter will do anything to beat you. He is the ultimate competitor. In a sport where failure is the norm (success 3 out of 10 times in most of our jobs would get us fired)Jeter consistently finds ways to be successful. I would put my money on him every time (and I would win way more often then 3 out of 10 times too).
