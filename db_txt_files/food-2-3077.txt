Ugh. I've never been a big fan of the Fig Newtons. I think I'd rather eat a vegemite cookie than down one of these nasty things. The idea of fruit inside a cookie isn't inherently unappealing to me, but the Fig Newton just doesn't pull it off. Maybe they're an acquired taste. If so, I don't expect to be logging the work required to build up an appreciation.
