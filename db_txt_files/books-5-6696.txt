I'm a Trekkie, and I don't usually read stuff other than Star Trek or Star Wars books. I ended up reading this a couple of years ago when my English teacher said I would like it, and, needless to say, it was AWESOME!! This is the only book I have bought that is not Star Trek or Star Wars. By the way, STAR TREK: NEW FRONTIER IS BETTER THAN ALL THE TELEVISION SHOWS COMBINED (I got my name from it). PETER DAVID IS THE BEST STAR TREK WRITER EVER. And why does SYWA9480RG call the Ender's Game books a trilogy if there are 5 books...?
