The Irish in general are some ofthe most educated people in the world, especially Dubliners who have the added advantage of living in a very hip, cosmopolitan capital. Everyone is friendly, witty, intelligent. The younger people, like highschool age, are alot more difficult to crack than the rest of the population, so I wouldn't recomend travel until everyone your going with is in college. There may be more fist fights there, but remember that there people don't have to worry about a drunk socio-path pulling a gun out and shooting people.
