Pokemon Gold was the game that REALLY introduced me into the complex world of pokemon. Before this, I had played things like Pokemon Stadium and Pokemon Snap (I also have Hey, You, Pikachu because I could not resist it....:D ) but this game, this really introduced me into the thrill of capturing pokemon. Not to mention the new breeding phenomenon they have in the game...imagine an endless supply of Eevee to get all five Eevee evoloutions (including two new ones for Pokemon Gold and Silver).
