The Swan, Extreme Makeovers and all those shows should make Brittany Murphy their queen. Ever see her in Clueless? Yes, she was in Clueless, looking homely and fugly. I think that was Pre-celebrity/Pre-Hollywood Brittany. A makoever later and she's supposed to be sexy? Not for me. She has a nice rack from what I saw in the movie she was in with Michael Douglas, but after that, I'll pass.
