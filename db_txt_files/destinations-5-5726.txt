For all you people complaining about Florida and talking crap about it move or don't visit again! It's simple don't move here or visit and stay the hell out of this state! I have lived here all my live in Miami and love it. Funny im a RN and I make 31 dollars a hour and only work part time and I am making it great down here!!! So people stay out if you don't like it. Theres a reason why we are one of the most visited state in the u.s. hmmmmmmm.
