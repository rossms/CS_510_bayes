At this writing, if the Democrat want a legitimate contender for the 2008 Presidential race, they ought to turn to the highly respected and largely bi-partisan Evan Bayh. Modest and forthright, with a sense of both decency and common sense, Bayh represents what good is left inside the Democratic Party- a party which has been largely taken over by the likes of idiots like Barbara Boxer, Terry McAuliffe and Maxine Waters (all shrill politicians).
