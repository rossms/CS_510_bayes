you haven't experienced the US until you've been to McDonald's. sure the food may plow through you like it was blown out of your ass, but it still tastes like gold. i guarantee that those of you who rip on mcdonald's faithfully return for a hearty meal. besides, have you ever been to mcdonald's and not atleast had a good laugh?...uh huh, i knew it.
