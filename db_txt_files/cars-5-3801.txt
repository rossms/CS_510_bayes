An awesome vehicle. Okay, awesome is a very overused word. But I can honestly say that this SUV/truck hybrid is both visually and viscerally impressive. There's nothing else quite like it. Yes, it's not cheap (sticker was $38k for Z71) but many dealers are willing to bargain, and a real steal when compared to the Cadillac version, which goes for over $50k. Versatile, comfortable, a blast to drive ...it has it all! Highly recommended.
