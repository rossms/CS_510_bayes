The first 100 pages of this novel are fabulous. Thereafter the plot begins to meander and the protagonist's obsession turns (as most obsessions do) to a tense monotony. Almost immediately one wishes to be done with the novel. Also, it objectifies a 14 year old girl in a way that is offensive mainly in its lack of uniqueness.
