This guy is really tough to rate. I could give him a 1 for 10 straight Division titles, but only one World Series ring. I could give him a 5 for 10 straight Division titles. But, this year, we're seeing a different Cox. Made Smoltz a closer and he may brake the ML record for saves. Platooning the Francos (Julio and Matt) at first base, and between them, they're having a great year. Bottom line, he's taking a decent team with a great pitching staff and has them playing the best ball in the majors. And, one way or another, he manages to do that almost every year.
