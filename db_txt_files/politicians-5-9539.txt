This man is still HELPING people in need.He is truly a man of faith,who practices REAL Christian values,such as charity and promoting PEACE through Diplomacy.NO OTHER PRESIDENT ALIVE is doing the good work this man does.He is a shining example of the Values others only pay lip service to.Humble and kind:very rare in politics.
