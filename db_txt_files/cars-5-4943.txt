LOVE IT! I have a 2003 2500 4x4 QC with the Cummins HO and new auto trans and absolutely love this truck. Took it on a trip from NC to MI. I drove this Beast through the mountains of WV to the deep Woods of MI and had no probs plus great gas milege. Duramax and Powerstroke better go back to the drawing board to keep up with this Cummins HO. I love leaving fords and chevys eating my diesel exhaust.
