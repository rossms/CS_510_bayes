GREAT TASTING and affordable are just a few of the attributes this rum has. By far the best rum on the market, Don-Q is in a class of its own and has a name for itself in Puerto Rico and the international market. Fanatics like myself are slowly introducing it to the US market, so if you get the opportunity to try it and you love it, just remember a guy known as El Capi told you so!
