Moby and GWEN rock! I love the excitement of the vid and how gwen stefani kicks butt. moby sounds really cool in that song and gwen adds the eerienss. I like the way they go good together. The part I hate is that moby did't like singing with gewn and he wanted a separate version of the song with only him in it. that was kinda messed up. I like the remix feat. gwen it's cool.
