We bought a 1990, silver bullet, in 1993 as a 2nd car. Very reliable, this car would not die. Our daughter wound up taking it to college and driving it to/from her job as an Irish Dance instructor, 45 miles away, 2x per week. Somehow, and this was really not funny, on a visit to her college, probably Parents' Week-end, one of her friends let it slip that they had dubbed my old family Taurus, the shaggin' wagon. See, now, that's really just not funny . . .
