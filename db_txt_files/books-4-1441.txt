I started reading Raising Duncan at Christmas time when the special strip Duncan's First Christmas ran. It's a strip that's full of love, and without any of the look how cute the kids are jokes that are in 95% of the strips out there. I also like that Big Daddy and Adele have a functional loving marriage, interesting careers, and aren't perfect.
