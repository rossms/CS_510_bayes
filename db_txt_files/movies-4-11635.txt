Funny, funny movie. If you like Luke and Owen Wilson, and the somewhat odd humor of Rushmore and the Royal Tenenbaums, you will probably like director Wes Anderson's first effort as well. Bottle Rocket is not going to blow you away with its plot (unlikely robbers get themselves into trouble), but the dialogue is at times hilarious, and the chemistry between Owen and Luke Wilson's characters make them likable. Definitely worth a rental.
