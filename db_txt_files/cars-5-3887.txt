I bought mine (Used) over a year ago and have been very happy with it. It was cheaper than the Explorers and Toyotas I looked at. With AWD and a V8 it was GREAT in the snow. Michelin tires are excellent. Stereo unit is very good; didn't have to upgrade. I like it's looks. Mine is black with factory aluminium wheels. It's no good off road, but I don't go off road. I can pull a small trailer with ease. The seats are comfortable for the 3-6 hours a day that I that I use it. If it holds up, it will be the perfect SUV for me.
