One of my favorite songs. I have heard some people say this song has something to do with graduation, others say it is about a one night stand. I would like to offer a third possibility. I believe this song is about two people who decide that they are going to have sex for the first time; possibly a one night stand, but more than likely a couple that has been together for some time. It is about how this event can change a relationship, and about the mix of joys, fears and confusion that surround this life changing experience.
