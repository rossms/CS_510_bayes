Coming from a media background, I enjoyed this film in that is addressed trends in entertainment content that push the envelope. We later saw this in programs like Big Brother and Survivor. It does call to question ethics in mass media. The film was a way to present these concepts/trends to the general population. I hope it provides some food for thought as well.
