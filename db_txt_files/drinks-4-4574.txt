Over all, a very good peice of work. Some problems, however. One, it uses Corn Syrup. Either use half-and half or go back to real sugar. The sickly, almost honey-dew like feeling corn-syrup leaves is sickening. Nice bite, however, a gentle cola overtone that Pepsi so dearly lacks. If there every was a true cola, Holland Coke in glass is it. Cheers, Coca-cola, for starting the greatest drink ever.
