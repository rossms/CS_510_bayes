I just started getting into whisky (starting with Scotch) about a year or two ago, and I am UTTERLY new to Bourbon, but I got one of those little airplane bottles of Maker's a couple of days ago, and was quite pleased. Gentle, not too sweet (certainly less so than Jack Daniel's -- and yes, I know JD technically is not Bourbon). I think I'm going to make Maker's a regular part of my drinking life, especially considering its reasonable price.
