I share the same sentiment as the first 3 guys. The biggest key for Taylor is his health. If he can just stay healthy, he is almost guaranteed to put up huge numbers. I think he can be right up their with the best if he can just stay healthy and just do his thing cause he has all the God given ability in the world. Not only is he 230 lbs and can run over a linebacker, but he also has incredible shiftiness and cutback ability to make the same linebackers that he's running over, and make them look silly.
