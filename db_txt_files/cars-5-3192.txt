The old fj40 model forged it's rep worldwide, and for very good reason. It was built like a brick $#*house and outperformed those Jeep cj's in all catagories. Don't be fooled by the new ones. They are truly wolves in sheeps clothing. I realize that most soccer moms won't be going off road (at least not voluntarily), but the ability is still there!
