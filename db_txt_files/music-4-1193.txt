I am really not a Thrid Eye Blind fan at all. I didn't like their first CD and I don't like most of the songs on their Blue CD. I find them too pop, trying to be more alternative. However, I gave the CD such a high rating for one reason: Deep Inside of You. I think it's a beautiful ballad and bought the CD just for that track.
