We do not have a Ben and Jerrys in our area but we do have a lot of their icecreams in the grocery stores. they have some of the best of flavors. i enjoy trying different types of icecream and Ben and Jerrys have come up with some great concoctions. I think there is a flavor out there for everyone.Most of my favorites would be most of the ones that have chocolate. Kind of expensive bu good for a treat.!
