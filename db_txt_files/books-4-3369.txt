 Me Talk Pretty One Day, a collection of essays about everyday life by David Sedaris, is a pretty enjoyable read. I don't appreciate sweet, cutesy stories, and I didn't have to worry about that with Sedaris' wicked sense of humor and talent for showcasing the bizarre. If you are easily offended by bad language or off-color situations, though, you should steer clear of this book. Sedaris is kind of raunchy at times, and definitely irreverent. Of course, that's why I thought Me Talk Pretty One Day was so funny!
