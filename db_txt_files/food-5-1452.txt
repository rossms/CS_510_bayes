I love Gummy Bears because their texture is good for most teeth. They are chewy, but not overly so like taffy. They make your hands sticky but just enough to make it fun. Not too sticky, like the experience of having a Now And Later in your teeth. I broke a tooth once and it cost me $600. There is quite a bit of variation in the texture of Gummy Bears with different brands. Some brands feel silky to the touch, others just soft, still others are firm, almost tough. Gummy Bears are a good way to keep small children quiet on a bus without giving them too much sugar.
