Holy crap any coach who had a CHOICE about choosing between Kelly Holcomb and Tim Couch would probably beg to be demoted to water boy. This team has never been good, and even sucked when they luckily made the playoffs. There is no talent anywhere on this franchise, and they are actually worse than their 3-5 record, if that is possible. You could replace the coach, the stadium, and all the players, but they still would be one of the worst teams in the league just because they are the Browns. They should relocate to Mexico City and change their name to the Seniorita's.
