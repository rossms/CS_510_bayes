As a Republican I salute you for your never changing stance on the war....You have taken a lot of pot shots from your own Democratic party in order to do so...You have been true to your belief....I believe the future of the Democratic party lies in good people like you and Liberman who stick by their guns...My hero is F.D.R....All of my family voted for him....We have just become so disgusted with the Democratic Party as a whole that we have switched parties. What in the world has happened to your Party? Or should I say who has taken it over?
