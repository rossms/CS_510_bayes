I have been riding since 1967 and have riden or owned just about all brands less the very exotic ie. Vincents etc.. First bike 1949 Duo-Glide EL. Bought my first Honda. K1 750 in 71 and have never swayed from Honda since. I just purchased a Shadow Sabre last year and as always, No dissappointments. Enjoy your ride no matter what you enjoy rding. Be safe
