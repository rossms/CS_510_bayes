In my opinion he was a good leader until he started his campaign to be re-elected as the head of the UN (United Nothings). When he started this campaign, he also started to support the hsotile Arabs states surrounding Israel, just to be able to get their votes and support for his campaign. It's not a manner of a statesman!!
