You shouldn't need Spring Break as an excuse to go to Key West. I've been 4 times (twice in the winter) and loved it. By day- snorkel, dive, sail, jet ski, kayak and tan. Nap. Then eat, drink and smile. It's like Disney for adults! Everything is reasonably priced, but there's so much to do, it's easy to go broke fast.
