Best Buy is in my Opion the number one electronic store. There customer service I would give a 4 star cause often times they are to busy to help everybody. I had bought a Televsion from best buy on a price match which they were excellent with. I have also purchesed many Cd's and DVD's at Fair prices. Over all there store has a great selection and provides a great service to the custmers. Also they have joined the Mc'D Manoploy to be able to win money to shop there which is pretty neat. I would suggest best buy over any others.
