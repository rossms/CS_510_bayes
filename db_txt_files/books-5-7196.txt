I have read the entire series (minus the latest installment-I'm waiting for soft cover) three times. When I started the first book, I couldn't put it down. When I wasn't reading, I was thinking about the book. Sometimes confusing, always captivating.. I think it's unfair to compare Sword of Truth to Wheel of Time. Though similar in style, ideas aren't stolen from Terry Brooks. It would be like someone saying that a band, such as Pilate, influenced heavily by Radiohead, has nothing original to offer because they've adopted some of the same sound.
