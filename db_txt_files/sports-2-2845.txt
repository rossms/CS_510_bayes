Maybe the guy just has a bad luck streak. Seems like he leaves and his former team goes on to win the World Series. The Rangers are a doomed team right now so it would be VERY impressive to see him take them to even a post season birth. I rather take the odds on a lightning bolt hitting me in the head.
