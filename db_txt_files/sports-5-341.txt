I THINK AROD IS THE BEST SHORTSTOP IN THE MLB. OF, COARSE I DON'T HAVE TO TELL YOU THIS. PEOPLE THINK CUZ OF THE MONEY HE'S MAKING NOW THAT HE SHOULD IMPROVE. HE'S ONLY HUMAN FOR GOD SAKES. BUT I'M SURE HE'LL DO WHAT HE HAS ALWAYS HAVE. GO OUT AND GIVE 110% i think he's got a better chance of going to a world series with a texas uniform on. people talk about how good derek jeter is and about all his world series rings and I'm not saying he isn't, but if it wasan't for the team he's got behind him he wouldn't have any of them.That's my opinion.
