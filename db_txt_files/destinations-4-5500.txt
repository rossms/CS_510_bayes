Positive Attributes:A very remarkable state which somehow has been able to avoid being turned into an industrial, economic and human wasteland considering its closeness to New York and Boston. Hartford is a very beautiful city, and I-95 is very beautiful to drive on by the coast. A lot of charming small towns throughout the state. Negative Attributes: Most commonly associated with all New England states, the people in Connecticut can be very very unwelcoming to outsiders.
