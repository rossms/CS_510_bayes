Chili's, ba ha ha ha! I applied for a job at Chili's and they ripped me off! Said I was hired but NEVER HIRED ME...very bad experience...ended up working at Valentino's...I don't work there anymore aha hah hahaha ha...anyway, back to Chili's...they are bad. Bad food, just another chain restaurant that no one should care about because chains are so generic. Get a life! Eat somewhere that isn't a chain!
