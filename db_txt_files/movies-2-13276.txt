From this film you'd think D-Day was Yanks only affair. Quick history lesson then. The US did not win WW2 single handed. Apart from most of the German army occupied on the Eastern Front, the US had little involvement in North Africa and in Western Europe, Britain had been at war with Germany for 2 years until the US joined in. Again, this film is an annoying example of huge bias just like that other one about the enigma machine.
