I would feel odd giving a chain like this 5 stars, but of all those big chains (Ruby Tuesday, Applebees, Chilis, Bennigans, etc), this has the best menu and the best drinks. LOVE those Jack Daniels chicken strips and pot stickers. The Fridays near my town has a real neighborhood bar feel. I've always had a good time there. Don't knock Fridays!
