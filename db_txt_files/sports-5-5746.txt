Great Great player. Built for the NBA. A big man that can shoot on the perimeter, rebound, block shots and work in the post. Built for the NBA. But I don't care about that right now. I care that he's built for the Final4. Actually, he's built for everything. He is just a baller. 5 tool player. Also, a great leader from everything Ive been reading in the Charlotte and Raleigh papers. They say he's quiet, but when he talks, everybody shuts up and listens. Even the coaches.
