This airport was a mistake to begin with - sure, it's grand, sure, it's meant to be beautiful - but it's too far from town, nobody stops there, and the place only has six gates! Come on! What kinda airport of a big city makes do with six gates?? No wonder this airport is about to be demolished. LOL.
