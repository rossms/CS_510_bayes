I am a huge Hitchcock fan. I've seen sooooo ooooo many of his movies. Psycho, Vertigo, Rear Window, Notorious, Birds, Wow. But why is this movie considered Hitchcock's second/third best by most people? I like it a lot but it's not in the Top 10 Hitchcocks and is not Top 100 quality. Besides the classic scene sayings, why is this film so amazing? Besides it being popular, why is this so amazing? Please tell me, someone. Tell me. Please. Someone, tell me please. Good answer, N by N fans. Great response.
