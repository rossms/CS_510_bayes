I bought My Own Prison because I heard two of the songs from the CD on the radio a lot and I liked them. The rest of the songs were not as great but still fun to listen to. The lead singer's voice gets a little monotonous and boring after a few of the songs, making it a good CD but not one I listen to all the time.
