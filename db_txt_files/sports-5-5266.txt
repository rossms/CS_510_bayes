My senior year of high school, growing up in Kansas, Danny Manning led KU to the final four and eventually won the tournament. We were watching at a bar and ended up spilling out in a crowd into downtown KC, where a huge spontaneous street party erupted. Everyone was so happy that the parents we ran into didn't even take our beers away - they just raised a toast. Viva Danny Manning!
