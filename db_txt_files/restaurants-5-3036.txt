Do they actually have 31 flavors? I've never really counted, but it seems like there are more. Anyway, it's great ice creme (except that I'm a firm believer that mint ice creme should be WHITE, not green). They have all those basic flavors (chocolate, vanilla, strawberry, green chocolate chip mint), as well as a whole truckload of other favorites, though I must confess my favorite is the French vanilla (yellow, not white, by the way). They also sell ice creme cakes there... might want to get one for a birthday or something, but I typically stick with ice creme in a cup... always felt cones were too messy.
