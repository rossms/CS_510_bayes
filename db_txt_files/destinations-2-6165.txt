Michigan is like bad sex. Its boring, not very hot, and smells funny (Detroit). I've lived here all my life and I'm planning on moving to Colorado. The seasons, with the exception of winter, are nice especially fall. If you are a hunter plan on private land. There are 1 Million (litteraly) hunters in this state, most of which shouldn't even be allowed to drive, let alone have a gun! All in all, if you are thinking of moving here plan on taking a lot of vacations and make sure you have reliable employment, the economy sucks.
