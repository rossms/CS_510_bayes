All my life (well, it SEEMS like all my life) I've heard terrible things about this man; but I get the impression his people love him. I don't agree with his politics but I don't doubt his love for his country and though I believe in America with all my heart; our policy of bankrupting a foreign country that is no danger to us was wrong on South Africa and it's wrong with Cuba. Castro may not be perfect but his behavior on the world stage is certainly no worse than ours. Like other old soldiers, I find myself liking and respecting my old enemy more than many of my current allies.
