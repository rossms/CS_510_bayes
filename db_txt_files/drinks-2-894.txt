Heineken is typical of northern European beers in that it is very hoppy and has a particular herbed taste, as the Germans like to put it. We call it skunky and it is an acquired taste. Grolsch is a better Dutch beer in the same tradition, but I prefer southern German beer styles. Heineken seems to be so popular because of marketing. Too bad.
