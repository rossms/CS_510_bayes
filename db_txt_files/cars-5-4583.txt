This is a Great Truck!!! I bought a bran new Nissan Frontier King Cab in December 2000.. Loved it.. But not quite big Enough to Bring a few friends along Offroading.. I Traded in the King Cab for a New Crew Cab..... Now I Love it even More!!! Excelent truck on the road but even better Off... :-) :-) Everyone Loves it..... Jay
