I'm a conservative. Evan Bayh is, for the most part, the kind of democrat I wish there were more of. He's moderate, reasonable, a fine public speaker, and is of high personal character. I disagree with a few of his policies, but that goes for virtually anyone. I hope that he wins the presidential candidacy for the democrats, because I wouldn't mind him in office at all. I would probably vote for him over some republicans, like John McCain.
