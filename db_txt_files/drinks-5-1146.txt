I've tried beer from Germany, beer from the US (shudder), beer from Ireland, even beer from the Middle East, and despite all the good stuff that's out there, I keep coming back to Labatt Blue. Labatt Blue has the smoothest body of any beer I've tried. The alcohol content is acceptable, there's very little after taste, and it goes well with almost any meal. The only beer that I see as better, is the king of beers, Guinness. Just an observation, but most people that don't like Blue, or Canadian beers for that matter, like beer with a similar consistency to juice. They really don't know what they're missing.
