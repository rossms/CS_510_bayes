He's so (YAWN) boring always yakking (YAWN) about the (YAWN) ozone layer, but (YAWN) a better choice than (YAWN) Dumbya for the White House. I didn't (YAWN) appreciate all the crap about (YAWN) what would Jesus (YAWN) do, but at least he doesn't always (YAWN) yap about God this and (YAWN) God that. Still, I'm getting (YAWN) bored just talking about (YAWN) him, so he (YAWN) only gets four (YAWN) stars because he's a liberal (YAWN) Democrat and that's good. Hagelin 2004! (And just for the record---YAWN!)
