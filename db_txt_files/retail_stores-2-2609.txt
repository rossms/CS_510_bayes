For me, Food Lion is an advertised special only shopping stop. If they have an advertised special that intrigues me, I'll make the trip, but otherwise I find that their stores are frequently small, dingy and understaffed. The quality of their produce is just average and the selection limited. Their meat tends to be substandard and their deli products inconsistent. Overall, I find it more convenient to shop elsewhere.
