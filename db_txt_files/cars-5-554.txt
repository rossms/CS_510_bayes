My comments apply to the KX-500. It's got plenty of power, there's more low end grunt than my tractor. Riding in deep sand is a breeze, you can loft the front end at any time, at any speed, in any gear. The handling is above my level of ability (yeh, I'm working on it) Despite the monster engine, it's light and maneuverable. NOT, however, a good trail bike - it's far more comfortable to ride fast than it is to put along with the kids on their KX-80s.
