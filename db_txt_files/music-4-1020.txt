The album, Everything you want is a great CD sending out their messages in a new kind of music. It is a lot more instrumental them most rock. The only reason I gave this a four instead of a five is because track four really sucks. I look forward to a new release and tour. I saw them and Nine Days open for Third Eye Blind.
