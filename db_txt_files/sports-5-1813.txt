Their back, even with stars out and all the rookies the Braves win. They are in the toughest division in baseball and still have the 4th best record overall 07-27-05. AJones is having the type of year he has always be capable of and Smoltz is still a monster at 38. With Chipper coming back into the lineup and healthy pitchers expect them to win the EAST by 5-6 games. Thats no easy task.
