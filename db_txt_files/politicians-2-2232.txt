In many ways, I admire Powell. He was one of the only members of Bush's cabinet to go against the grain, many times. But, I still hold him accountible for not speaking the truth when it could have made a difference. This makes him almost as culpable as Bush, with whats going on in Iraq right now...(400 dead in the last two weeks).....Unforgivable
