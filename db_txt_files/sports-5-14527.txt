One of the few players ever that could have dominated in the pros without having gone to college. The most powerful legs of any back ever. His thighs were acually larger than his waist! Could probably have averaged fours yards a carry without an offensive line. I saw him run over too many defensive players to count. What a joy to watch. A true legend.
