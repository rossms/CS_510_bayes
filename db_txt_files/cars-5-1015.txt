I have a 1999 LE with 57k miles. Nothing fancy or exciting about this car, infact, it is rather boring. But it is the best car I have EVER owned. I average 30 mpg, it has never broken down and it has never been in for warranty work. While the lure of other more exciting cars is out there, this work horse is hard to beat.
