Odelay is the album that proves Beck to be the Frank Zappa of our generation! His musicianship and arrangements are beautiful and he puts everything together with a great sense of humor and undeniable energy and creativity. He also shows a great deal of versatility, seemlessly blending various genres such as hip-hop, funk, country, folk, rock and jazz to create sonic masterpieces enhanced by wry, rambling, irony-tinged lyrics. He can write slow-tempo folk ballads like Jack-ass and Ramshackle and also create rollicking dance tunes like The New Pollution and Where It's At .
