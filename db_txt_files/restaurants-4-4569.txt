I go to one specific location, and I have never had a problem there. They've been nothing but friendly. The wait is almost always long, but it's worthwhile. The Cheddar-Baked-Potato soup is great, their pork chops are excellent. The selection is good, but I stick to my usuals . It's nothing fancy, but it's very decent in pricing and a pretty nice atmosphere.
