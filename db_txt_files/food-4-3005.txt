Chips A Hoy are really good but they will never be able to compare to a homemade chocolate chip cookie. I love the chewy kind as well as the original although they are totally different from each other. The rainbow chips variety is always delicious as well...maybe even more so than the regular chips-ahoy. Basically, what makes them so good is that we don't all have time to bake our own cookies whenever we want them and chips a hoy deliver a good replacement.
