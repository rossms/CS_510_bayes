I don't know how these fools can bash the Corvette! GM really scored big with the introduction of the C5. Overweight at less than 3000lbs!? Give me a break nimrod. Powered by a 345hp LS1 V8, the C5 Vette is not only a sports car to be reckoned with and an extremely comfortable ride, but an American legend.
