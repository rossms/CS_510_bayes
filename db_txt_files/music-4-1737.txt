I thought that this cd was very good. I know it's basically a bunch of their songs that they never released, hence didn't make it on any of their previous cds but it's still a very good cd. It really shows the different stages that Green Day as a band went through in terms of maturity through their music. My favourite song has got to be Ha Ha You're Dead . Great cd overall and I recommend it to all Green Day fans.
