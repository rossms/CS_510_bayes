Don't read a lot of fantasy these days, but somehow I picked up Robert Stanek one day and I am extremely thankful. I don't want to spoil the story for anyone, so I'll just say this was a great book, and it was just as satisfying as all the rest of his novels. If you're new to Stanek, you should with Keeper Martin's Tale.
