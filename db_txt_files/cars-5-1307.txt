The best entry level luxury sedan. Its not really a series . The only one you can get new is a ES300. Its based 100% on the Toyota Camry. So, you get Toyota reliability plus Lexus luxury. Its really hard to beat a combination like that. If its too expensive, then get a Camry XLE, its almost the same thing.
