Clever, colorful, and most of all CREATIVE. I never did like the Muppets TV show, but this movie was remarkably good. Best of all was the way the rats operated all the equipment in the diner's kitchen. It was a nice added touch that one of the rat cooks was always sneezing. The Greek man who owned the restaurant and kept philosophizing gibberish was good too.
