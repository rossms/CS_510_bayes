My favorite fast-food place...for zero-guilt sandwiches!! The thing they teach you in modeling school is eat lots of chicken and turkey, and drink lots of water! As a model, I frequent this place for healthy 7 under 6 choices. I try different ones each time. The honey mustard ham is YUMMY. So is the sweet onion chicken teriyaki ( lean and tender, savory, teriyaki glazed strips of healthy white meat!) I am not a huge fan of turkey, but the savory turkey breast and ham is to die for--lean and tender sliced turkey breast and smoky sliced ham--gorgeous! I am a fan!
