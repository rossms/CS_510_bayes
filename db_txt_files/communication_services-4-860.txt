Telus has the best price going for a contracted price here. Some awesome deals. pros - price of a contract (Talk 15) - features like Call waiting, voice mail 3, call display, etc - Free local calling 6PM - 8AM Cons - costs a lot for text messaging on the talk 15 plan - Tower signal strength unstable (varies a lot) I am quite satisfied with the service and am happy they have settled thier dispute with thier union.
