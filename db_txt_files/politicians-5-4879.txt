Politics aside for now, Rumsfeld is the Secratery of Defense. So far, I haven't seen any more terror attacks here at home. Doing a great job defending us. Excellent speeches and work on the war in Afghanstan and Iraq. He definetely knows what he is doing. As for politics, he's a Republican. Enough said.
