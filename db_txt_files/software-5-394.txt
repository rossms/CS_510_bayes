I love windows98SE, yes I am still using it. I love the way I can easily use DOS and I can run really old software and the newest stuff with no problem. With a smoking processor and good memory, I refuse to upgrade. My husband has windows XP and believe me they haven't got the bugs out. I still use windows update for win98SE. Great operating system and I have used most.
