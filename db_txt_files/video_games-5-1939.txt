Definitely my favorite video game. Playing versus the computer is not bad at all, with a multitude of levels, options and weapons. However, easily the best part of the game is the multi-player combat mode. There are a whole host of levels and scenarios, complete with options to aid less experienced players. A must for every N64 owner.
