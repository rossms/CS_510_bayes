It was very cool to gamble here. I kind of felt like I was in a James Bond movie. However, there aren't a tremendous amount of options and you have to dress up to get into the casino (no jeans or shorts, collared shirt) which was tough for a college kid backpacking through Europe. Also, if I remember correctly, you had to pay to get in.
