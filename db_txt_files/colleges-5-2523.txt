The University of Mississippi (Ole Miss) has a terrific law school and an outstanding business school, and the School of Pharmacy is one of the best in the country. The people are friendly, and the campus is beautiful. Located in and around Oxford, Mississippi, the university boasts some wonderful sports and recreation facilities and the convenience of a town that is not too small, yet not too large. I loved it so much that I now work there!
