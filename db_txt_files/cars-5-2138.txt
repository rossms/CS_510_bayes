The Soarer is the finest GT produced since the DB4GT,and it has inspired so many copies, after all it is the sincerest form of flattery, the XK8, AM DB7, The latest Merc coupes, were all inspired by the Soarer, if its good enough for most of the quality makers around the to copy then its probably better than all of them, as each will have to make some compromise!
