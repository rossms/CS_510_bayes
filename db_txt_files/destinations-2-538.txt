It's a shame that this tropical paradise is inhabited by people that don't appreciate it. The streets are dirty, the beaches are dirty, everyone wants to sell you something, which is fine, but after saying no 5 times, you think they'd get the hint. Unless your going to a private resort, save yourself the disappointment and stay within the USVI or BVI, I like St. Thomas, St. Lucia, Tortolla and Barbados.
