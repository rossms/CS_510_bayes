Very good 2nd album, in addition to the three radio hits ("Cinnamon Girl" "Cowgirl in the Sand" and "Down By The River") the more or less country- rock title track is also a truly superb tune, as is "Round and Round."Excellent guitar playing from Neil and the late Danny Whitten on this album. Not quite a 5 star album, but one of his best ones IMO.
