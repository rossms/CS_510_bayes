Robin Williams can be both funny and a dramatic actor. I liked him in Mrs. Doubtfire, and Patch Adams,Fisher king, Awakenings.and Good Will Hunting. to name a few. Sometimes he can be a little over the top. but for the most part I really like him and think he has a lot of talent. He was also good in Good Morning Vietnam where he had the chance to adlib during the radio scenes, He had the chance to be both dramatic and funny in that film.
