This city is simply BEAUTIFUL!!! In all of the northeastern quadrant of the continent, I have never seen such a beautiful city in such a beautiful harbor setting. There's a romantic, cultured air to this place, and not just by the waterside. Charming, beautiful....I am just breathtaken by it. This is a must see!
