I tried P.F. Chang's for the second time tonight. The first time I was kinda disappointed since I had imposed vegetarianism upon myself...and the choices were not too interesting :) Tonight, I just went there with a couple of my friends after our modeling shoot. Wanted some real high-protein, low carb stuff. So I had the chicken with black bean soup. It was absolutely delicious!!! The slices/chunks of breast meat were stir-fried, tender and fun to eat! Highly recommended!!!!
