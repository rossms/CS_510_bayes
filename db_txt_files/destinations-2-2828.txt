Philly is an oaky city if you like dealing with people who live in the past. I used to live there, for 38 yrs as a matter of fact, and as I got older, my desire to leave became stronger. I have to say, I have been living in Seattle now for 4 yrs, and I DO NOT miss Philly one bit. I agree that the people in general are rude, with attitudes, and it is a rather filthy city as cities goes. I can honestly say, I am never returning there to live.
