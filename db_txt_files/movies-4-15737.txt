Overall very compelling and well done. It's rather cynical, which can be good or bad. I was was just speechless by it at first but upon later viewings I wondered why, for example, Charlize Theron's character didn't just go out and get a job instead of just staying cooped up in the house all the time so she could be miserable and go crazy. There was a bunch of little yet consequential things like that that came to my mind. But overall it was very good.
