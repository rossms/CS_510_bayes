This book was good, but too complicated for my enjoyment...I liked the other Net Force book: Hidden Agendas, but Night Moves just had too many odd names, places,and people to keep track of...I do enjoy Clancy's ability to incorporate the latest technologies into his stories and make eveything very realistic even 10 years into the future...
