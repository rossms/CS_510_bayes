copenhagen is an exquisite city with copper topped towers, canals, cobblestoned streets, an anarchist free zone, very fun night clubs, bleeding edge interior design and architecture, castles and moats. it's true, the city is expensive (on par with london and paris) and the city is SMALL, charmingly small and copenhageners are approachable, friendly and at times eccentric. the best time to come here is May-July, with Christmas being second best if you plan a snowboarding trip to Norway or Southern Germany - then pop up or down to CPH.
