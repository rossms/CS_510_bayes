My regular smokes for a while (off and on between these and Camel Lights). Very pleasant, good smoke. Just about right for me in terms of flavor and smoothness, and something I could pretty much smoke all the time. They do taste a little artificial compared to a lot of cigarettes I smoke (I like to vary brands), but that doesn't bother me all that much. Among other brands and styles, MB lights were considered a step up from reds among my childhood friends.
