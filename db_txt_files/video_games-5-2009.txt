In a word, perfect. This game has everything. I don't like RPGs and never will, but this is not your ordinary RPG. It is more of an adventure game. When you first get into OoT the first thing you will realize is the sheer size of the playing field. You'll be running all over creation. SO TOTALLY FUN! Buy this game for the best experience ever. The only flaw about this game is the Water Temple. Holy crap, that is so hard. Took me a month to beat that. But now I finished the game and am doing it for the 3rd time.
