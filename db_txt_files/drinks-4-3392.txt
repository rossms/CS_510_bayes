While the flavor certainly receives a full 5 stars, the extreme amount of calories is a setback. Im sure it is still somewhat 'healthy' at the end of the day, but so is a McRib... I love the dreamsicle flavor - my #2 smoothie behind Smoothie King's Peanut Power Plus (strawberry). If in moderation I definitely suggest trying this - go for a sample in the morning to get you through the busy workday.
