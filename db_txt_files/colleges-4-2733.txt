I attended UND in the 90's. The campus is clean and spacious, with a mix of old and new buildings. Has Law and Medical schools, good residence halls, and a pretty good selection of undergraduate programs. It is very cold winter, and Grand Forks can get pretty boring in the winter, so it gets a 4 instead of a 5. They have a Division I Hockey Team, a nationally recognized aerospace and meteorology department, and plentiful housing for married students (or students with kids).
