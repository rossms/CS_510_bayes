Personally I like the Bali Hai's most, but the blacks are good too. The head buzz..well if you've never smoked them before you might get one the first few times. I did. But it doesn't last long. They are not any worse than any other cigs, thats just an urban myth. not any better either, but hey. If you want something else try the unfiltered ones in the metal box! Now those are harsh!
