It's become a bit of a theme in my ratings to either eviscerate a piece of work for its blatant stupidity, lack of talent, lack of creativity, etc., or to profusely express my gratitude for those brave souls who risk being not liked by all the valley girls by producing art that [shriek!] makes one think about things deeper than booty girls and gold teeth. This is yet another one of those works that gets my seal of approval for the simple fact that it's not the same old mindless eMpTyV trash.
