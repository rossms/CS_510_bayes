once he wins the big one I'll bump him up nice guy though... even though Illinois fan this team has the horses to win it all... 6 nba players might be exagrated a little... okay he won the big one and I was very impressed with Sean May... We had no answer for him last night congrats the better team did win... but you have to be honest that self or krueger would have never got illinois that far......
