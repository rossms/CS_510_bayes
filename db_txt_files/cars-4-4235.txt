We have a 2000 Sienna; bought it used after it had obviously been run hard...Only problems were squealing brakes; dealer tried to fix twice, but couldn't...I finally put on ThermoQuiet's myself and fixed problem. 85K m now; no engine problems; No real perks with this car, but reliable, safe transportation, which (after owning a windstar) is now at the top of my list of requirements.
