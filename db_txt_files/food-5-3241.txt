You just can't make some people happy. They want restaurant gourmet food for pennies and to eat as much as they want without gaining weight! I am a gourmet cook myself, lean cusine is a great bargain and I think these people have done a good as job possible for portable, frozen, low calorie, meals. It's a very cheap dinner. I started the diet a week ago because I got fat eating my own cooking! It's easy, the calories are counted, and I think the food is great. Stouffers, thanks for making my life a little bit better! I'm slimming down!
