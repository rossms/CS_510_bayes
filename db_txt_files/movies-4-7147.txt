This is the first of the vacation movies with the Griswalds. It is quite funny. Chevy Chase and the rest of the cast are all good as a family leaving from Chicago to get to the fictitious Wally World in California. Along the way they stay at cousins where they have to bring aunt Edna with them an old ornery aunt who ends up dying on the trip{ what Clark does with her after that is pretty funny} The Griswalds have bad luck on their trip on their way to Wally World only to have a real big surprise when they get there. this is real funny movie. It got a lot of laughs out of our family.
