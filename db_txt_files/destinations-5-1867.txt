To anyone that does not have USA rated 5 please leave. If you notice the people that don't give OLE USA a 5 they are angry that we don't have a bevy of socialist policies. Thank god I say. For many reasons USA is #1 for me but it should be #1 for the world because we are the only beacon of light that gives all people hope. Whether it is us giving food and AIDS medication to Africa or destroying tyrants like Saddam (soon the coward Bin Laden), America as always is there to help the less fortunate.
