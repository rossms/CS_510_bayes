Old Navy is great for basic, knockabout clothes (eg no frills shirts, khakis, etc). I can always find something good on sale; however, I would not depend on Old Navy for your primary source for your wardrobe, as the clothes are not the highest quality. Men's fashions do not change as much so it is a good investment to spend a little more so that clothes last for more than a few years.
