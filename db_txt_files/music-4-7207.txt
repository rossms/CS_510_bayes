Another good experimental 80's video, the clay work in it was a lot of fun! I think the choppy video actually complemented the constantly changing visuals that accompanied it, though I can see how it can get kind of nauseating after a while. This video was purely a visual experience, I don't believe it's meant to really have a cohesive, linear story line for this one. It doesn't really have a point , per se, it's just a mixture of visuals.
