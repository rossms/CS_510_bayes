It is so easy to blame the preacher or the coach. This man is an excellent leader and coach. Can't you just hear the other ACC recruiters, You don't want to go to Tech, the accademics are just to hard. We aren't that way, come to Georgia, Miami, Florida State, and just play football. You don't need to learn anything, just play football. The truth is Tech is a great academic school whom just happens to be good in football, basketball, baseball, golf, and tennis. Gentlemen, this does not just happen. Chan Gailey is a part of this great challenge and deserves our support.
