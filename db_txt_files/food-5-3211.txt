I have purchased the Marie Callender's Turkey Breast with Stuffing dinner twice so far. Each time I found it to be absolutely fantastic. I am single and I don't like to cook big meals for myself. These dinners are perfect. I just add a fruit of some kind to the menu and it is a extremely satisfying and nourshing meal...Thank you Marie for the wonderful alternative to a huge meal preparation.
