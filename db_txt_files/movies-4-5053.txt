It was actually a pretty good movie. I may have went weird on my last review, so I'll make this one short. This movie was very funny, had some short, hilarious gags and actually surprised me. Anyone who likes the show or watches it, should see this. Because I didn't really think much about Spongebob the show before, I liked it okay...but after this, I walked out fairly entertained and even like watching this movie over and over again. Patrick star was hilarious as usual and they take his doltness to a new level and Spongebob tries to prove his loyalty to Mr. Krabs, his boss.
