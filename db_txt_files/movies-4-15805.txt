It's funny, because when this movie first came out, I thought it looked really cheesy from the commercials and had no desire to see it. A couple of my friends dragged me to go see it, and I was very surprised at how good it was. It was so sad, all 3 of us were bawling! I love the part when he takes her to the state border and says You're in two places at once. It was so sweet. Shane West is adorable.
