Who needs sweet in this cereal? These lightly toasted golden brown flakes taste great with or without milk. Sometimes looks can be decieving, but try this cereal to have enough energy during the day. So far, this is the best whole grain cereal without additions of honey, sugar or fruit I've ever tasted.
