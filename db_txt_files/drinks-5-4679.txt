Can't beat the feeling... amazing that Pepsi is actually sweeter than Coke. Coke actually has more of a bitter taste... yet, there's just something about it that's just YEE! The taste is just... unexplainable. How do you describe it when it doesn't taste like anything else? Well, all I have to say is, if you like colas, this one's #1! If you don't like colas... well, you probably won't like this one either.
