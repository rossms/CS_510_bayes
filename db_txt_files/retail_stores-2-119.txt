Well I think that if you buy a product from Amazon.com and it actually being sold buy an independant shop or person, Make it more clear when ordering. I have been waiting for a strategy guide I have been waiting for 8 weeks and still nothing. No updates and Amazon doesn't show any order being placed. On my account.
