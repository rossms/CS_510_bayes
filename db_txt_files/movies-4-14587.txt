If I weren't such a Virginia Woolf fan, I would have given The Hours five stars. But the movie takes such liberties with her life. Despite this slight to the historical Virginia Woolf (who suffered manic depression, not suppressed lesbianism as the movie suggests), The Hours is a beautiful story. Besides, how can one not be entertained by Meryl Streep, Nicole Kidman, Julianne Moore AND Clair Danes?
