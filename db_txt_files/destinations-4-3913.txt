Pittsburgh does seem to get its share of emotional reactions (both positive and negative). I've visited a number of times and have been impressed with the number and variety of cultural attractions, the seemingly amazing job that has been done to clean up the city, and the great restaurants. Nice neighborhoods like Squirrel Hill. I'm sure there are plenty of negatives (none of which I experienced, however); I'd go again (and probably will) just for the Sunday Brunch at the Grand Concourse (an elegantly restored early 1900's railroad station that is now a restaurant).
