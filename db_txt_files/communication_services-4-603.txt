I love my Metro PCS phone. I will be glad when their is extended service to the Napa, Fairfield and Vacaville areas. I understand I need to give Metro PCS time to complete the extended coverage areas. I live in Vallejo. I have no problems with my phone service. My phone is Kyocera and it holds a very good charge. I hardly have to charge my phone and I use it a lot. I am really surprised and pleased. Thank You Metro PCS!!!!
