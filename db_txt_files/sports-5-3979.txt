You people don't have a clue, Coach Rupp played black player befor he ever came to Kentucky, his high school teams all had black players on them. In 1950 he help a great black player to get a scholarship to Duquesne University his name was Jim Tucker and went on to become a great All-American, Rupp also held coaching clinics for black coaches going back to the 60's. People who call this great man a racist know absolutely nothing about the man.
