Pittsburgh has an excellent night life, great colleges and universities, and a thriving art scene. I'm not quite sure what the previous poster was talking about when dissing Pittsburgh's art scene, but it was rated last year as the #2 Cultural destination in the US by a major arts magazine whose name currently escapes me. While some of the locals can be small-minded, there are certainly plenty of cultured intellectuals around town to spend time with.
