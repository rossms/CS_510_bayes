Lots of neat things. One point of advice, though-- when I was there, I came across some mirror/vision exhibit where visitors were encouraged to put their noses up against a spot between two mirrors. Dumb mistake, there was actually a smearable pool of other people's nose grease there. Ugh. The mathematics section was interesting. The Big Dig feature left much to be desired.
