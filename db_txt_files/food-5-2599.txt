I'm really suprised to see this brand name as far down on the list as it is. This is my 3rd favorite (behind Snickers and Mars, respectively). I know this might sound warped but when I was younger I used to peel off the chocolate shell until I had the nougat exposed. Then I would roll it up into a ball and eat it that way.
