Conway's comment about affordability and nightlife stunns me about as much as does Eric's geographical missconception. To Conway, Zurich has for as long as I can remember been ranked amoungst the top five most expensive agglomerations/cities globally. As for the nightlife, have you checked out Zurich Nord or just stuck to the trapled path? Eric I suggest takes another look at the map & think again. 'EU' is a political term wheras 'Western Europe' geographical. Now Eric try again, wher is Switzerland on the map?
