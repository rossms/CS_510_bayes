I went to this film prepared to love it since I generally love Robin Williams movies. While it had its moments of comedy and sorrow, the film didn't draw me in as I thought it would. I found myself not really caring about the characters when it told a story that should have been very touching. In all, it came close to being a good movie but just wasn't there.
