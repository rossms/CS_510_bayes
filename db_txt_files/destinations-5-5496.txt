Connecticut is full of great, out-of-the-way places. I've lived in Connecticut for my entire life and enjoy the quiet surprises of Windsor especially the hip feel and food at Centre Coffe Bar and excellent outdoor concerts at Advo/Summerwind. Some local info can be found at http://centrecoffee.com , http://windsorcc.org/wintour.htm and http://www.swind.org/
