Comparing a blend to a single malt is unfair. They're two completely different things. A single malt has only one flavor base and only one shot at tasting good, which is why when they succeed they're so special. A blend is mix of several different whiskys to create a final product. Most "everyday" scotch like Cutty Sark, J this is one to sip neat.
