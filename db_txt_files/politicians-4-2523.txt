I like Dole. . .although I voted for Clinton, many got the sense that the Republican party knew that no one would beat Clinton- so they volunteered Dole and he got thrown under the bus. Nice guy who ran for president (1) too late in his career and (2) at the wrong time. Hope he's enjoying retirement.
