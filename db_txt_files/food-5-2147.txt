I remember when these were called Marathon in Britain.The name doesn't matter,i love them now as much as i did then;comfortably the most deliciously satisfying chocolate bar,the perfect balance of flavours and textures-chocolate,caramel and peanuts.(This is beginning to sound like an advert).They really must have come down from chocolate heaven.
