Buckhead is by far the best place in all of the south to party. Lots of hot, smart, and ambitious gay guys hang in Buckhead. Great clubs, restaraunts, cafes, etc. I go to Buckhead quite a bit whenever I make a trip to the ATL to visit my best friend. We always have fun there. I love Atlanta. One of the greatest southern cities ever ! Also, few can deny how awesome ATL guys are...hot, fun, smart, and totally cool...
