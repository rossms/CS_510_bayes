Bill, we miss you! I'm really sad a lot of people would let something as trivial as an affair (which I'm sure many of them are also guilty of) ruin which definately should be a 5-star president. These were the 8 best presidential years I have witnessed since being born. By the way dubya's going down in 2004! LOL.
