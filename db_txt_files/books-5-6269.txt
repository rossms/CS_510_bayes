Hilary Rodham Clinton is a truly horrible human being (if she is, in fact, human) and I am deeply worried that Liberals are going to push this sociopath into the white house in the near future. After you've read this wonderful book - and after you've read Ann Coulter's wonderful book on the pathologically dishonest and vile Bill Clinton - you'll be mortified at the prospect of Hilary Clinton being in an administrative position of any kind. This is an awful woman who is a threat to young men and to many young women, as well.
