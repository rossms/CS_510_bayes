Beautiful landscape. Very historical. Only problem is the toll roads. TO SUBARU7: It is backwards outside Philadelphia & Pittsburgh. I lived in Allentown for two years and I am glad to be out of there. There is almost nothing to do there, especially on Sundays because the malls (both of them) close at 3 p.m. After that, what is there to do but sit around at home and do nothing.
