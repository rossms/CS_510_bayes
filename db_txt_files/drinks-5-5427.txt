How about that epidode of The Simpsons where Homer walks up to a street vendor in New York and asks, What do you have to drink? The street vendor says, Crab Juice and Mountain Dew. Homer wretches in disgust, then quickly asks for a Crab Juice. Homer, who has so many good instincts, is missing the boat on this one. Mountain Dew may look faintly radioactive, but it's loaded with caffeine, and it does the job when you need a little boost.
