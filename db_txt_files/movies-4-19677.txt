This movie really turned the tide for horror genres. Instead of being helpless victims that get lucky and manage to defeat the bad guy, this movie pits the vile Freddy Krueger against some sleep deprived juveniles. The turning factor is that these juveniles learn how to fight their own fears and battle against Freddy on his own turf. It is every kids dream to battle their dream fears and win.
