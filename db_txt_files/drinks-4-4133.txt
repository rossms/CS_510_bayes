I love captain and coke in the winter and captain in gingerale in the summer. However, I am on the Low Carb diet and have no idea of the carb content of the liquor. I use diet coke or ginger now but dont know if the Capt. is messing up the diet? Does anyone know the carb content of the Capt.? Please e-mail me if you do.
