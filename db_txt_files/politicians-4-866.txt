He might be arrogant, over-concerned with being popular, winning elections, and leaving a legacy , but I'm still a fan of Chretien. After all, how can one not admire a man with a disability who is a below average public speaker who has won three back to back majorities and remained incredibly popular? I wouldn't say he was a great man or anything, but compared to the abysmally low grade of politicians we see in Ottawa, we're lucky to have him in the driver's seat.
