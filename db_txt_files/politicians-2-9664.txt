Horrible. Sent soldiers into Nam for no reason, and more for his politcal gain. Also, he is the brains behind Medicare, Medicade, and other social spending programs, which ARE NOT required by the Constitution, and are a waste of tax dollars. He did do one good thing. He was one of the very few Democrats who supported the Civil Rights Act.
