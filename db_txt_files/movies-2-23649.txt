I found the first installment of the Matrix series somewhat wanting, but compared to this, the movie was a masterpiece. The special effects are pretty good, but FX does not makeup for dialog or story line. The movie leaves a terrible Next week on star trek type of cliff hanger, and the entire plot line leading up to the climax of the movie was shown in snip-its. I will see the final installment, but I cannot say I will like it if it turns out to be anything like this piece of manure.
