Fun, energetic midwest metropolis. Great public transportation system for tourists to get around without auto. Probably 2nd best looking skyline in the world behind Hong Kong's. Great lakefront/downtown district with parks, museuems, theaters, shops, etc. Weather is actually better than you might think, except for winter, which does suck.
