Lame; poor food, little flavor, slow service, bizarre music (they crank it up every 5th song or so to give the place a sense of excitement), and at least in Vancouver Washington, a great location. But it doesn't make up for the overall lameness of the experience. Go to Beaches, a mile or two to the East.
