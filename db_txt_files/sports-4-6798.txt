Van Gundy did a great job the past two seasons witht he heat. Actually out coached Larry Brown in the Pistons series but his horses pulled up lame in the playoffs. Like Nate McMillan it is stioo to early in his career to give a rating any higher. Coaches have to prove themselves over time with changing talent and situations.
