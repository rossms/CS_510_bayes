i love it here at Texas State. Despite what people think this school has offered me an excellent education. I don't know much about the rest of the school, but iam getting a top notch music educatio here. we have nation wide known professors here. one of our theory professors graduated with a PhD from Harvard. I take voice lessons from world renowned opera singer Ms. Cheryl Parrish. My music tech teacher has won something like 7 grammies. this is an excellent school in a very laid back atmosphere.
