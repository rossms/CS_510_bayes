It's been quite awhile since I traveled in the Tube, but the experience left me with some very vivid memories. Not the least of which was a time we had to board an elevator that looked as though it was about 200 years old. We descended for what seemed like 2 miles before the doors finally opened. There was just something about being underground in a place with so many centuries of history. Aside from the delightfully creepy gothic ambiance, it was also a very reliable, quick and easy way to get around one of the best cities in the world.
