A well-done look at an integral part of U.S. history. Be aware that when you get into Boston's North End, it's pretty much of an Italian neighborhood. You might hear Italian (or, more properly, a southern Italian dialect) being spoken there as much as English. Don't be surprised. I thought that was a neat part of the Trail (although there are those who, I suppose, would be put off by it).
