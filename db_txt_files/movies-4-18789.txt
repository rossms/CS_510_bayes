This movie is better than most other typical hollywood horror flicks. This movie is not gory like other slasher horrors. The make-up was done superbly. The story was confusing but chilling. And most important the biggest factor of all is that it gets to your mind, it scares you pshycologically. So if you're sick with the typical slasher horrors, see this movie for a change. The more you think about it, the more you will scare yourself. P.S. unplug your TV!
