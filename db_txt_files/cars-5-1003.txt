Well, I've owned a lots of cars down here in the UAE and to be frank i wasen't so proud to own them but when owning a reliable car, with an extremly working and perfect performance you should be really proud Coz you have a camry boy,, Mine is 2001 AT tarnsmission Full options .. its amazing and perfect so far but there are few comments -The Wheel is quite rough -Parking Sensors are not available -Tires Size should be bigger 16 to be exact. and guys you can't imagine the camry or toyota's in general is having a high resale value so its like investing and enjoying !!!
