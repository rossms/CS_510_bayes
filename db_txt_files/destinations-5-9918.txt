My regular smoke for a long time. Camel Lights are pretty strong for a light cigarette (they always remind of Marlboro Reds, with a little less edge), but good nonetheless. I could also smoke these things all night long with no ill effects on my throat or voice or anything (well, no ill short term effects :). Camels were considered the step-up cigarette from Marlboros in my old neighborhood, which everyone I knew started on.
