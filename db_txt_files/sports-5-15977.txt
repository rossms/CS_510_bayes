George is durable with imposing size and strength. He's patient and waits for his blockers. Once he hits a seam, he's real hard to stop. He's like a boulder rolling downhill. Extra-aggressive between the tackles, George will run over you. I don't think he's as effective when bouncing outside, because he doesn't have much burst or explosiveness. He'll go through you better than making you miss. His hands aren't the best, either. He'll drop passes, fumble too much.
