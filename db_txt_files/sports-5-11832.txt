No other running back on this list could carry Sims' jock. Billy Sims had clearly the best combination of speed and strength of any back in college football history. Sims led the great Oklahoma teams of 1978 and 1979 to Top 3 finishes. After winning the Heisman as a junior with 1760 yards and 20 TDs, he was robbed as a senior since the voting occurred before the last 2 games of the regular season. In those 2 games, Sims ran for 500 yards and proved himself far superior to Charles White.
