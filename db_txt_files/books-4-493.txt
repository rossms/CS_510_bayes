This is possibly one of the cutest books I have ever seen. The author guides the reader carefully through the steps involved in feeding a wild animal. This creative technique also teaches a moral, not to be taken advantage of. Of course, this moral is only understood, usually, by other older readers, in which case the moral has already been learned.
