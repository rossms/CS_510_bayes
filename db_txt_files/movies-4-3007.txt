Insomnia is one of the better cat and mouse psychological thrillers of recent years. Pacino plays Detective Will Dormer, who is tracking a cunning killer in Alaska. The film, while slow at some times, manages to keep a firm hold on the viewer's attention, leading up to an explosive climax. Kudos to Pacino for his performance, as well as to Robin Williams, as it was interesting to see him play a darker role. Overall, Insomnia is highly recommended, as it is highly suspenseful and quite interesting to watch.
