Good prices. . .I wouldn't take a flight longer than 2 hours. . .above-average customer service. I am surprised to read the other reviews because I have flown Southwest several times and never had a delayed flight. I like the cattle-call seating. . .it makes people hurry up and get in line. Their baggage-handlers put a big hole in my suitcase but they replaced it no charge. . .I was satisfied. All-in-all, a good no-frills airline.
