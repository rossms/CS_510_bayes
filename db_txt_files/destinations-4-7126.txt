Another must-visit stop on any European tour, but keep in mind that Amsterdam, unlike other European capitals, isn't so much about imposing monuments and avenues - it's more known for its neighborhoods, hangouts, and informal charm. That doesn't mean leave the camera at home, though, because its canals and architecture make it a beautiful place.
