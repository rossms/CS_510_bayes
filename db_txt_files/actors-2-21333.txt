Thing is, people might say that we hate Hilary because we're jealous. Jealous? Are you kidding me? What are we going to be jealous about? Are we jealous because we don't want to have talent like Hilary? Hey I want to be talentless too! I use to like Hilary untill she started a singing career. I mean dear, please stick to acting and work on it. Honestly if Hilary did have talent I would like her. I would respect her if she just stuck to acting. Lay off the singing then I'll respect her again.
