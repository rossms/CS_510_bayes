Waited too long for food that was at best, uneventful and unimaginitive. The cobb saled was a mangled mess of watery greens in a dressing that barely applied. I counted six pieces of chicken breast and found one crumb of blue cheese. Flavorless! Even the specialty cheesecake was lacking in flavor and overpowered by mounds of imitation whipped cream. A new restaurant in Beachwood Ohio that is way overrated and overpriced. Stick with the neighborhood standards.
