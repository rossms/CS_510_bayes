It's not the size that counts it's the motion of the ocean. Rhode Island is a coastal state, and since it's so small everyone is within at most 45 minutes of the beach. Everyone is within about a half hour of capital city Providence, which underwent a recapture program by the mayor about 8 years ago and has totally transformed to a safe, fun city. URI is a great beach party college and Newport has some great life and bar scene. Only downside of RI is the poor condition of most of the highways. Providence is also the only major city left that has significant mafia presence.
