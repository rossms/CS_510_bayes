Don't be a goofy tourist and go to Badaling (that is just a tourist circus) If you want nice, quiet time with the wall and take great pictures, try Simatai (my spelling might be slightly off) it has a few tourists but the steep climb keeps the weak-knees away. The Wall is a must-see, but it is better to see it outside of the Badaling tourist trap.
