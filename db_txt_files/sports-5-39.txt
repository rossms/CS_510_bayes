I read that he is an ok fielder at firstbase. Are you kidding me? He has worked hard on his defense and now rates better than 75% of the players who play there currently. He routinely scoops balls out of the dirt and can make all of the routine plays as well. The hitting speaks for itself and will probably only get better, if that is even possible. This Cardinal will be joining the other redbirds that have their plaques hanging in Cooperstown. So sit back, watch, and stop player hating.
