Formulaic and boring. I found it sad that Jamie Lee Curtis felt it necessary to do the strip tease scene. She is smart actress and I think it was too bad she felt the only way to revive her career was to exploit her body. It didn't add anything to the movie aside from gratifying the loser horndogs, that's what porn is for.
