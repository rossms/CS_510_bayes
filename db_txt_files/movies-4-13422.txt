 Forrest Gump. I have alot of love for this film. It is a deep and touching story of one man how as an individual takes his place in history. You see him as a young boy, watch him fall in love with his grade school friend Jenny and then see go with him on the journey of life. It is really neat to see Forrest take his place in history. You grow very fond of him and almost think of him as a good friend. Tom Hanks is incredible as always. But he is helped out by a great supporting cast.Robin Write and Gary Sinise yo name a few. Definetly a charming movie. Loved Bubba.
