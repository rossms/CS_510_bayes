Mars bars are a real satisfying candy bar in my opinion. I love the thick chocoate outside- you can even eat some of just that part when you want. And the stretchy yummy middle stuff is fun and delicious. And the main dense but fluffy light chocolaty stuff is great too. All those together make for a incredibly yummmy dessert!
