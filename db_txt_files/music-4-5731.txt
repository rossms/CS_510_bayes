This and Ride the Lightning are a great rock and roll legacy for arguable the best Heavy Metal musician ever in Cliff Burton. I don't listen to each new release anymore, but this album and its predecessor are the best examples of this genre outside of ST. Maybe better, because they managed to reach a larger audience . . .
