Tom Hanks did an excellent job of communicating a feeling of helplessness and lack of survival skills. The raw tropical environment, instead of being beautiful, really seemed very unpleasant. The plane crash and surf action sceens caused me to feel actual pain in addition to my wife putting her fingernails into my arm. The dialog with Wilson balanced the movie and allowed the audience time to compose themselves. The end of the movie could have been a little warmer. It left me with a hollow feeling. A more upbeat ending might have been a better choice.
