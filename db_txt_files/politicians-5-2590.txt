I, personally, adore John McCain. God, this guy has gone through everything! He was taken as a prisoner of war in Vietnam, tortured, beaten, abused. He can't lift his arms above shoulder level because of the extent of his beatings. He has been battling skin cancer and going in for surgeries and treatments. He lost out during the presidential election because of lack of funds. He has a kind smile and warm, brown eyes and a gentle aura that betrays his actual spitfire attitude. The article in GQ about him was excellent and showed that he's not perfect, he's human.
