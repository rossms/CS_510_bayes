Closers in general are overrated. He is only good because he is used to going 6 or 7 innings and has well over enough stamina to go one or two. His stuff is very good, but as a starter he was humbled by the likes of Maddux, Glavine, Johnson, Clemens and others. His fastball is good, and he throws harder now. His splitter is the best I've ever seen, and his slider is good. He has great control but has been outpitched by many others of his era. He's like Mike Mussina. He just won't be remembered. Not as a starting pitcher at least.
