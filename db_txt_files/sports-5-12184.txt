With all due respect to his teammate Matt Leinart (last year's Heisman winner) and Texas's Vince Young, USC's Reggie Bush was hands down THE player of the year- and definitely deserved the 2005 Heisman. Blessed with great speed and agility, and unparalleled versatility on the gridiron, Bush is a footballer's footballer. Moreover, Bush has the ability to succeed in the professional ranks, not only because of these forementioned intangibls, but also because of his reknown work ethic and veracity.
