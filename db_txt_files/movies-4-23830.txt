Not the best movie I've seen, but I enjoy it every time I see it. The premise behind the plot is a little weak, but once the movie starts moving, it's really good. For the most part this is a family friendly movie, though I wouldn't recommend it to anyone with young children (The pod-person scenes can be disturbing, I think). Overall, a reasonably good movie.
