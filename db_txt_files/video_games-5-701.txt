Stratego ROCKS. I always loved utilizing my miners since they are the only ones who can trump the bombs. I used to get pretty good at determining where my opponent's flag was (usually in the corner). The sergeant usually was useless but the scouts were expendable, simply because whenever they'd strike a bomb, they'd die and then I knew where to use the miners. One of my tricks was to use everyone from the captain on down the ranks at the beginning, and then gradually wear my opponent down towards the end with my majors and colonels and whatnot. I liked the blue pieces better for some reason. A great game.
