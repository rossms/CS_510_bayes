Great company, got off to a bad start with those Ericsson phones, but they have changed over to using Nokia as their flagship phones - good choice. Service is great, have never dropped a call and if I have a problem with my phone, it is replaced with no questions asked. I have used some of the other companies - Cellular One, Airtouch, Ameritech and SprintPCS and they just don't compare. Pricing is competitive and hopefully, they will continue to improve. One down point - no wireless web, but that is coming!
