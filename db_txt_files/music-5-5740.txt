One of the Greatest Rock Albums of all time. The Guitarist Randy Rhoads and Ozzy did this album in 3 weeks which seems impossible to me for such a powerfull record. Also Tommy aldrige and Rudy Sarzo are not on the Album. It was the Blizzard. Bob Daisly on bass and also wrote all lyrics and Lee Kerslake on drums. This Album is a must have.
