I wish I had turned eighteen before he was elected so I could have voted for him. I am glad that he is a Christian, that he stands up for what he believes and I think he has been doing a very good job. I fully supported the war in Iraq because we were attacked and when you are attacked you usually try to protect yourself in some way. Some people apparently have forgotten about all the people who died in the attack on 9/11, I mean, if that's not an attack I don't know what is.
