The state has one of the highest rates of unemployment in the country. Portland and Eugene are not bad cities- but Portland has a crime rate. Winters though not cold are overcast and damp. Too many Californians escaping the high costs and moving to Oregon. Also outside of Portland and Eugene too many rednecks and skin heads.
