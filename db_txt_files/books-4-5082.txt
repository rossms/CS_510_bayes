The austere language and unyielding seriousness of this story are the only things that make it absurd. Besides that, the accuracy with which Defoe describes the mundane details of life ship wrecked on an island is a realistic take on swallowed fantasy. Crusoe ages throughout the procession of the pages in a highly believable form, and this story is the best example of youthful carelessness turning over to adult responsibilities, even though it all happens on an island.
