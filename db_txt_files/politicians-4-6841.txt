Im mad at the media. I have read the transcripts of what he said. He said that he wished THermin a happy birthday, and that he had one the presidential race back in.. . Ok. So have ANY of you ENER heard of a complement? CHRIST! all he was doin was wishing an old guy happy B-Day, and the Media takes it a a racist coment! you should all be ashamed for screwing this guy over for no reason! ESPECIALLY THE DEMOCRATS! they're really annoying. Republicans hold this country together. The democrates sit around and debate what the republicans do. Grrr.
