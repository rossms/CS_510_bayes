I am in my 4th class in the MBA program as is working my butt off to earn an A; What do you mean easy; I'm spending 20-30 hrs a week studying and writing. (Note: I graduated at a top University with a double major in Computer Science and Mathematics with a 3.80 GPA). I must admit that I hate the group projects.
