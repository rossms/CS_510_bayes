This is my first year at DeVry in orlando and i have to say it has been the best experience i have ever had.I have been to two other colleges here in orlando and the instuctor sucked.Devry teachers well the one in orlando anyway have made me a critical thinker and have brought out the best in me. And don't even get me started on financial aid. If you want the education you have to pay for it. nothing is free. One more thing i can take my credits to any location i want unlike some of these other so called college.
