I'm rating them so high, not because of their current season, but just because I like them so well. In '77, they were the perfect picture of team work. Bill Walton was sensational, but he couldn't have won the championship by himself. I also like them because Portland is my favorite city, and even though I moved from there 27 years ago, I still miss the place, and the Blazers.
