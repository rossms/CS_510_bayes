I love California. It has everything and other things that the rest of the nation hasn't got. In fact, California is so far ahead with laws and culture as well. I have never experienced this so called stereotypical "california attitude" people are EXTREMELY open-minded. I always think of California positively. Sure it has it's problems, but no other state will match California originalism. To Iontu42: If the Californians had said, "stay in your own state...we don't want you!" in the early 1900's where would the Midwesterners gone? What goes around comes around bucko.
