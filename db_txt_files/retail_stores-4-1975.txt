I feel like a crackhead with a pocketful of cash everytime I walk in this store.... So much magnificent and useless crap to buy. The best store of its kind. I have had one or two customer service related problems in the past, but they were settled to my satisfaction and I've taken alot of electronics in for service and usually have had prompt service.
