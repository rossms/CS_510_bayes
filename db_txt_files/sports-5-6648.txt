Well guys don't know if you've checked the standings lately or not, but we're in the mist of a 10 game winning streak and ready to challenge the Heat for another trip to the Eastern Conference finals. LB has so much experience and knowledge his presence is all that is needed. The Pistons are going to surprise a lot of people just like they did last year. LB should get some of the credit for how well they're playing right now and for the championship run last year.
