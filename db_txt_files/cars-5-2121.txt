find out the meaning of the word humility when you drive this super-GT (mine's a '91 tt)... try to remember what a privilege it is to be able-bodied enough to enjoy driving this unique auto... take care not to surprise third parties with excessive speed at close proximity, just wait for a bit of open road and shake the reins, a pleasure truly enhanced by solitude... 6 stars!
