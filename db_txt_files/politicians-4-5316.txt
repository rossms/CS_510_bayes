Since this is a post-election rating, I must say I think that (assuming Bush wins) Al Gore lost the presidency, Bush did not win it. Al Gore made dumb, nonfactual statements about items that did not matter. Why? These became an issue where there need not have been one. There were all sorts of chances to call Bush on his shortcomings, especially his Texas non-record. Also, Gore had at his disposal one of the consumate politicians alive today - Clinton. Gore failed to use this significant asset, either by taking his advice or sending him on the campaign trail. Shame!!!!
