To the Englishman: You need to be worried about the muslim occupation of your country instead of bashing our president! In 10 years England will be run by a muslim majority. Thank goodness there are people like Bush out there- a sound mind in the midst of chaos. I didn't know we were suppose to give proper warning before invading a terrorist nation. I'll have to remember that if I want to become more liberal and destroy my country. update--If the press and the liberals hate someone you can be sure that's the right person to vote for!
