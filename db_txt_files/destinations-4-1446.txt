The fact that someone doesn't support the US doesn't mean it's a bad country. You Americans have to learn to look further than just your own country. Your country isn't the best and greatest in the world. I'm not saying France is but please take a look around. You Americans think you are undafeatable which could turn out to be an illusion someday when they kicked it this far that the whole world is against the US. Which probably won't take that long anymore.
