Excellent game. It has much more depth (more goals, gaps, stats, etc.) than the first one. But at the same time it was, at least for me--a THPS 1 veteran--unbelievably easy. I still play it. In fact right now I'm trying to wipe out the gaps and cheats. But it does get somewhat boring since it's so redundant and so simple to beat. I still think there should have been more levels, including much harder ones to challenge the veterans. But it's still a great game, definitely worth buying.
