I just traded my 96 Protege. I truly abused this car and yet I got the full trade value for it. I never had a scheduled maintenance done. I used the cheapest gasoline possible and rarely had an oil change. Stupid, I know but who had the time! The point is, for a car in it's class range, it very well should have fallen apart. But it had 125k miles on it and with a few minor repairs I'm sure I could have gotten 200k out of it. Not bad for $175.00 a month car note.
