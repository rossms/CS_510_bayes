Pretty much overrated. You know the state of Hollywood is pretty sad when movies like Memento are hailed as genius and well worked and incredible, engrossing thriller . In my opinion, it was the equivalent of taking a prescription painkiller and then attempting to sit through an advanced calculus class. Fuzzy, confusing and just not worth it.
