Not too far off 30 years old and not really showing its age. One of the better war/anti-war flicks and one of the better films to come out of Australia, in my opinion. The battle scene at The Nek, in Turkey, is one of the most demonstrable of the conduct of the Great War - 150 boys slaughtered in little more than an eye blink, then another 150, then another. No heroics, just dead people.
