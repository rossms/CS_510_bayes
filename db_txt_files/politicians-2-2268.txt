I once loved this guy, and believe he could've made one of our greatest presidents of all time if he ever wanted to, as he commanded tremendous respect from both America and the World. But after 9/11 he became a puppet of the Bush regime, and agreed to do anything they asked, including lying to the world about weapons of mass destruction in Iraq. He was a master diplomat, but now subscribes to the Bush foreign policy of using war and threats rather than diplomacy.
