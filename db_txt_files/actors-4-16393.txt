He's not great but he is a good actor. I liked the scenes with Luke and Luara but Luke and Summer really had a sort of connection also. Anyone who ever saw a scene with him in it would probably say that no matter who he is working with he really keeps you going to the very last scene and he leaves an impression on your heart wether good or bad. That is a good actor.
