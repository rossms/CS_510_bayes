I love my 93 celica, it runs strong and is completely reliable. The body styling is sleek and the sporty features make it very appealing. It's not the top of the line sports car, but it's a great car for anyone. My GT-coupe has almost 150,000 miles on it and still performs well with minimum upkeep, i.e. regular oil changes, tune-ups, ect. Newer celicas are just as nice but I like the design of the 90-93 models the best. I recommend a celica to most people. If they want a top of the line sports car I'd go for a supra, and if they prefer suv's I'd go with a 4runner. Just keep it toyota!
