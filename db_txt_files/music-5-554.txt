To me, U2 represents what a great band should be. Not only do they write incredibly good songs, but they also deal with the issues that are important to them. Too often bands care so much about their image that they lose touch with the important matters surrounding them. U2 has not forgotten their heritage, not to mention all the great bands that influenced them, and it shows in all of their great music.
