There used to be an ad that said burgers shouldn't have squares . I would tend to agree but those square burgers sure are good. The old Dave's Deluxe (which has beocme the Big Bacon Classic) is fantastic and the well publicised open late idea has made Wendy's my default if I can't find a Steak n'Shake. More then that, there chiken sandwichs are real, meaty, chicken breats, not the processed mishmash that others are famous for. The only thing I would like to see Wendy's do diffrently is try to shed their 'fast food look'.
