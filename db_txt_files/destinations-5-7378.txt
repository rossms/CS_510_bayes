The most beautiful city in the world. Thankfully, it wasn't destroyed during WWII beacuse it was declared an open city at the beginning of the war and Hitler's orders for its destruction were not carried out at the end of the war. I didn't find Parisians rude. If you consider Paris a cute France-based theme park where everyone should beg for your tourist dollars instead of an historic city of 4 million, I hear there's a version in Las Vegas that might suit you better.
