Florida is the greatest place I have ever been! I live in Florida and it rocks! I have never even seen snow before! I love living here because there are lots of beaches and it is pretty civilized.A lot of people act like all it is, is old people but that really is not true. In fact only 17.6% of the Florida population is made up of people 65 or older. The whole thing is made up to sound 100x times worse than it is. Also no one here is a redneck or a hilbilly or anything like that.
