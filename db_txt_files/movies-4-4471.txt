Even if you don't like Jim Carrey, this is a great see for adults. Ron Howard does an excellent job of really bringing Whoville and its characters to a cartoon. May not follow just by the book, but a great, creative and funny movie. Can't tell the Grinch is Jim Carrey. Definitely a good film to see.
