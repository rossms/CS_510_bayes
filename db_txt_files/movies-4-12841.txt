we rented this. Pretty good as a documentary goes. They showed a lot of interviews with Aileen so we could get an idea what she was like. They also showed what kind of life she has from childhood on up. and interviewed friends and family members. After all this I could see why she had so many problems. she had a pretty tragic life indeed. It did not make it okay to kill all of those men, but at least it gave some insight to the person she was.
