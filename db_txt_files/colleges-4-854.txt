I have am half way through my second course with the UOP and I must say that it is well worth the extra money. I went to the UMN twin cities for a year, and another online college for two years. This has been the best experience, it allows me to work my full time job and maintain full time school status throughout the year. I really feel the professors are great and readily available if you contact them.
