Grant...Few years ago was my idol, now the injuries killed him.I dont know what will be with his career...Its bad, cause its completely player, statistic shows it.He shoud rest for couple months, then train. Then he would back to the top, Im very angry- why the injuries hit him, it shouldnt happend, now the fame of GH is shorter and shorter. But he will return to the top, I wish it happened!
