Lucky Charms are fun to eat. I like to save all the marshmellows for last and then eat them all at once. It's also colorful. They taste good, especially for dinner. It's so sweet that I can eat it whenever I crave something sweet, instead of candy or chocolate. Lucky Charms has less fat and calories than candy and chocolate.
