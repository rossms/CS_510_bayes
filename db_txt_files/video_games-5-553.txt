I'd describe chess as a game that's easy to learn and incredibly difficult to master as once you get into it there's a whole wealth of different strategies to use and a vast scope of different playing styles to discover. This is because of the simply astounding number of move combinations that can occur in each new game. Seventeen octillion combinations can occur in the first ten moves!
