I love this store! I like a lot their clothes, especially their polos and graphic tees! Sure, the clothes are more expensive than Wal-Mart and Target. But they are worth their price! And the prices are a bit more reasonable than A&F. They last through the washing machine and don't have the strings come out of them and/or shrink after one wash! Lots of times, they'll have sales on their graphic tees (eg: 2 for $12). It's worth checking out!
