I already have problems with Roman Polansky, but aside from that, this movie still doesn't go anywhere. Johnny Depp plays his character well, but the viewer is left not caring what happens to him or the people with whom he comes into contact. They all have some type of perverse or jaded quality that leaves them hopeless. Perhaps that was the intent, but I could care less whether or not Depp completes the set of pages.
