Jon is a GREAT coach and he more than proved that a few weeks ago. He is a coaching genius. He should have won NFL Coach of the Year this season. He deserves to be the coach of this year's Super Bowl winning team. I have a feeling that this was just the first of many. He is an amazing man and may I say from a female perspective...quite WONDERFUL to look at!!! I Love football now.
