Great acting by Matt Damon who plays a twisted sicko obsessed with a rich boy to the point of creepiness. He has an unbelievable knack for making me know what's in his character's head without the aid of words, gestures or narrative overdubbing. And ALL of the supporting roles were played excellently. The end is good too, it leaves one hanging in a most uncomfortable way ...
