Lincoln was the savior of our constitutional Republic during the time of its greatest peril. To argue to the contrary is extremely disheartening and not worthy of comment. War is frequently a cruel necessity but Civil War is always heartless tragedy and a horrendous wound on the society where it occurs. He and Grant were the most magnanimous victors of a Civil War and even in death it was the legacy of forgiveness he bequeathed to his successor: Andrew Johnson. His actions during the war were limited and understandable.
