I tried Bacardi Limon about two years ago (mixed with coke), and really liked it. It's got a nice citrus flavor, and no after taste. You can pretty much get the same taste by adding regular Bacardi Light rum to Lemon Coke or Lemon Pepsi. The percentage of alcohol in Bacardi Limon is less than regular Bacardi (light or dark), that's why I usually opt for the Lemon Coke and Bacardi Light - more alcohol for the buck.
