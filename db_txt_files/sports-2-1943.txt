Ok, you've got to respect the Yankee history and tradition but that's about it. Heck, any team can be great year in and year out if they have the highest paying salary in the sport. Steinbrenner dishes out so much cash it's sick. They're the sole reason MLB needs a salary cap. Everyone loves the Yanks and that's reason enough to not root for them. Go Cubs! Hey, I live in Chicago and root for my team even if they suck!! That's a true fan!!
