Seould has a nice vibrant lifestyle. I like the bars, the drinks and places you can go to entertain yourself. There are even amusement parks to go to..but make sure you make friends with some of the locals....as they know how to bargain and get cheaper tickets than what they charge us military people. Wouldn't mind going back!
