I think i would really give her a four and one half. I have seen in her in many movies musical, comedy and drama and she is good at all of them. With her beautiful singing voice I especially like seeing her in musicals. She was the perfect Mary Poppins, and Maria. I thought she was really funny in Victor\Victoria.
