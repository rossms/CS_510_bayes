A cold fish amateur with no fire, depth, range, charm, anything. A mannequin. Did so little with some really juicy roles. Insipid looking, too. A real phony as well, in that she tried to convey this sense of elegance and class, when the truth of the matter is she was one of biggest sleeparounds in Hollywood, supposedly great on her knees, like M. Monroe, and especially, Nancy Davis, future First Lady of the land.
