I'm like Janey, I don't go hankering after new clothes and shoes. But when I have to force myself to update my wardrobe, I go to H M, they are affordable, have a nice line on most of the time and it doesn't feel like a chore to go in there. Last summer I bought the most gorgeous wine coloured suit for an interview I had. The blazer fit me perfectly, the material was fantastic and the skirt rounded it off nicely. I got the job!
