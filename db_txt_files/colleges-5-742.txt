This online university is just that. It fits my schedule, I don't have to be logged in at any particular time and I get EXCELLENT customer sevice. The professors e-mail you, the school checks in to be sure you're ok with the next set of courses. AND they share their experiences about the classes they've had and what you might be going into. This is what an online univerisity experience is all about. To put the icing on the cake they are regionally accredited! Job Well Done, Jones!
