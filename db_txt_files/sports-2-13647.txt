Excellent at developing running backs, but acts too smart for his own good. For instance, he made the grave mistake of drafting the unproven, out of shape, inexperienced Maurice Clarret who was slower at RB than some linemen at the combine. UPDATE: Looks like I was right. Maurice Clarett didn't even make the team.
