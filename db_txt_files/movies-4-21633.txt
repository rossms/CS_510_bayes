Surprisingly, I liked it and I'm a girl. I had low expectations going in, and I wasn't familiar with Tolkien's work. And I rarely think any movie is worth three hours, but I didn't find this movie too long. In fact, it wasn't long enough - it left me in complete suspense! Since I can't wait until next Christmas for the second part, it looks like I'll have to read the book...
