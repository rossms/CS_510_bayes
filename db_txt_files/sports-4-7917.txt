Great all-around player, except for he doesn't seem to be much of a 3-point threat. I don't see why all the "the next Jordan" hype. I thought it was supposed to be Kobe? Or is that Wade? He's Lebron, not Jordan, and he'll play like himself. He needs to find a better team, the Cavs aren't going anywhere anytime soon. Teams like the Pistons could use his scoring.
