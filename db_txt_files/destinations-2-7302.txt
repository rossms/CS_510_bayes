I am italian and i wont be nice on Milan. What do you want? It's not that special. It's an industrial centre, nothing much. The only good thing is the cathedral and that's it. i suggest...visit the outskirts...much much better... Milan It's more for shopping, and that's it Its the only italian city i dont like
