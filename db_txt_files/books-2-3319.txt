Dear me, the books are just getting worse. However, once I have started reading a series of books I tend to continue with them and I am hoping that these are going to start picking up. Anita is really beginning to annoy me with her contradicting moral grounds and Laurell seems to be totally making up the rules on vampires and werewolves as she puts pen to paper. Her books do not seem to be that structured anymore.
