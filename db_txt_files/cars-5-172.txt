118 is pretty fast for a 4-wheeler that tops out at 68mph. I love mine i raced my buddies 04 400 ex and stomped him, I dont even want to trade it in for the 06 450 i am a carberated man. Its funny when dumb ass people try to tell me that their kfx 400 is any diffrent then my z (read your fu**in frame) It is the same damn thing
