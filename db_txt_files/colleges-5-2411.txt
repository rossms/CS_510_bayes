UR is a terrific school, a midsized research university that offers plenty of opportunities in a manageable size. Academics are excellent, especially in the sciences and music (Eastman School). USNews rates it as a first tier national university. The campus is very attractive and well maintained. I was accepted at top med schools after my graduation. I enjoyed all 4 years at Rochester, made many great friends, and believe my undergrad education compares favorably with my peers from top schools around the US.
