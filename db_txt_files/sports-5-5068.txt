David Thomson is the best college basketball player ever. Anyone who thinks otherwise is a moron. Alcindor was good, and is IMO second... Walton was good as well. However, neither of them were close to DT. He took basketball to new levels... ask anyone. What kind of compliment is it that David Thompson is Michael Jordan's idol?
