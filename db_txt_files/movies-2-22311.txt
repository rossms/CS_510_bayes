I liked Jurassic Park when it first came out, I was barely twelve. Looking back, I believe JP was a movie designed to appeal to a slightly immature audience. Strip away the special effects and all that's left are a bunch of characters running all over the place which is the not the stuff that Oscar calibre movies are made of. Jurassic Park is a thrilling ride the first time around, watch it a second time and you'll see Jurassic Park for what it really is: a showcase for computer generated special effects!
