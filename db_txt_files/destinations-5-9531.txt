With all the things to see in London, you might not think of the underground, but it is a wonder in itself, and was one of my favorite parts of my trip to London. Almost anywhere in London is easily accessible by foot, thanks to the fact that tube stations seem to be everywhere. Since I live in a city that doesn't have a subway....I was VERY impressed.
