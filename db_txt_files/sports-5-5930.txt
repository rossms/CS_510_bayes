JJ Redick deserves player of the year this year. It is unbelievable how he can just completely stuff someone in their face, shoot a three around 2 feet behind the line, and STILL make it. All of us Duke fans know the whole all JJ can do is shoot a 3 well this isn't true at all. At the virginia tech game at tech, he made 3-8 threes and had 19 points total. thats 10 points without 3's. He is amazing and everyone who hates on him are just completely mad that he isn't on your favorite basketball team!
