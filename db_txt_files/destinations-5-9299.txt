Margarita is a more open and drier island than i'd expected,just off the coast of Venezuela.I enjoyed the garden in the centre(if i remember the geography rightly),and of course there are some lovely beaches with clear turquoise water.The highlight,though,has to be travelling by boat round the lagoon lakes,through mangroves, and accompanied by pelicans.It was certainly an exciting new experience!And i must add that the hot shark pasties cooked by the very friendly local Indians were delicious.
