It is probably the best university for business, law and arts in Canada. On top of its prestigious academics, the on campus life is amazing. There is always something going on in the campus and the general feeling is a very warm student-oriented atmosphere. The schools biggest asset is the large amount of international students on campus especially from Europe, the Middle East and East Asia. The campus is self sufficient, and students like myself who live in residence do not see the need to leave for entertainment and food purposes etc. However, the university is in Toronto and is truly an amazing city!
