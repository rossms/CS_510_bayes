I didn't quite get it, the movie or the phenomenon, but thought it was harmless fun, for what it was. I liked the whole idea of the Midnight Movie thing and the audience participation angle certainly seemed unique at the time. Still, it hardly qualifies as a classic, at least not to me. More of a social event than it was a movie.
