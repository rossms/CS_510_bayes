This car is awesome! It is very reliable, quiet and quite comfortable. Even the base model still had power windows, lumbar cd with steering wheel controlls and cruise control, automatic lights. With other cars you have to start well below those features. It is certainly not meant to be raced but it is very respectful and comfortable. Not to mention great on gas! Im averaging 30 mpg for a full size car! Oh, plus it has pleanty of leg and head room.
