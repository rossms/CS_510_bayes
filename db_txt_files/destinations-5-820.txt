Socially progressive - medicare, welfare, gay marriage, and marijuana. Fewer ignorant folk than the States. Better international reputation (trust me, sew a Canadian flag on your luggae if you're travelling.) TRUE COURAGE (and not cowardice!) by not buckling to American pressure to join in the war in Iraq. Cleaner environment. Lower crime rates. Rated as 'Best Country in the World in Which to Live' by the UN a whack of times in the 1990's. Cheaper Universities, better schools. THESE are things for Canadians to be proud of!
