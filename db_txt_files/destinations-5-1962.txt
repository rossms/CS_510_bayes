Speaking as a European: yes the US really is a great and fascinating country with much to be proud of - though not for the silly jingoistic reasons usually given. It is not the richest per capita - several European countries are richer such as Switzerland and Luxemberg. It is not the freest - there is more personal liberty is several European countries such as England and Spain and it is certainly not the mosty just - just take a look at the legal system. It is nevertheless one of the most interesting countries in the world and the people are great too.
