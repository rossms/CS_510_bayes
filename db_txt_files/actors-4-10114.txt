Sigourney's claim to a fame has been through the Alien trilogy and although she's proved she can be a versatile actress starring in some recent comedies, I don't think she's starred in enough films to get an overall picture of her true acting ability, although no doubt she is highly talented. Like Nicole Kidman she has a certain charm and mystery about her that makes her very appealing to watch not to mention oozes sex appeal.
