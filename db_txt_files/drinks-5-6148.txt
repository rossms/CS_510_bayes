Not too many sodas are what I would term refreshing. 7up is one of the few exceptions. This and the fact that is has no caffeine, little or no calories and a clean not too sweet taste is why it's my favorite soft drink. Also, the only beverage with less guilt attached to it than 7up would be bottled water.
