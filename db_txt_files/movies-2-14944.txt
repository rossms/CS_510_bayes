This movie has just recently come out here in Australia, and I can only hope that other Australians realize how historically incorrect this film is. Didn't it occur to anyone whilst writing the screenplay that a city called Washington didn't exist in 1770s America? And yet it is mentioned in the movie. Apparently attention to detail isn't important to people who cast Aussies and Brits in a film about the American Revolution. Save your money--read a history book instead.
