Many people think they are geniouses for understanding this movie. This is one of those movies that everyone seems to respect, though everyone hated it when it came out. Why do I like it? Because it's a weird, offbeat movie. That's why I like Kubrick's movies. This movie did make me think about what's out there, but no one understands it, least of all me. If you want to see a unique movie and don't have a problem with bright colors and monkeys beating up other monkeys, this could be the movie for you.
