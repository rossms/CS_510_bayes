A really great small city halfway between Toronto and Montreal. Very historic and attractive with several universities. There are also several prisons but that doesn't detract from the overall good vibe of the town. This is one of my favourite cities in the country. If anyone gives a damn about Canadian history there is Old Fort Henry on the hill overlooking the water, and John A. MacDonald's grave. That's if anyone gives a damn.
