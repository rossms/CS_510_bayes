Jewel's sophmore album, Spirit, had a confidence and polish departing from the raw Debut Pieces of you , and carried it off spectacularly. Still the social activist, sweet romanticist, and great philanthropist, she offered a rousing rally song with Life Uncommon and gave all proceeds of the single to her umbrella Charity, Higher Ground for Humanity. Oscillating from the independant Hands, to the sensual Jupiter, Jewel proved throughout this album her vocal mastery and ongoing social relevance. Cheers!
