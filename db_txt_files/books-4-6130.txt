Hilarious little book, and I have given it more than once as a gift at an office party. It is well suited to opening at random and reading for two or three minutes at a time (i.e. good for reading in the smallest room of your house). If you ever need to know how to climb out of a well, or painlessly dump a nightmare blind date, or how to survive a nuclear explosion, this is the book for you.
