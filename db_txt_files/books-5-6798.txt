Absolutely brilliant!!! I recomend these books to anyone reading fantasy as the plot truly is gripping. Pug (milamber) comes into his own as a fully fledged magician with powers only hinted at at the begining of the first book. Arutha's character also develops and the stories following his family are awesome!!!!!
