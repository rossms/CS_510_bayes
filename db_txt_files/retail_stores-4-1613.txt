well.... thier selection of itmes there is good.The Craftsman tools are really good quality and carry a lifetime warrany!!! but they will no longer have many computer/IT realted items... htey only have one or two brands of networking gear left and I dont think they've ever sold linksys wireless access points or anything else from them there they only have 1/2 an aisle of comupter stuff and they mostly have home theater stuff in their electronics section.
