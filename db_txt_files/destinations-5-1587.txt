I understand some people's concern over how Israel is really Arab land, but here is a question. Don't Jews deserve a place to call home too? I mean they have had a difficult history and some people don't even want to give them land that is about the size of Vermont. Anyway about how the USA has wronged the Native Americans. Look we were a lot less cocerned back then and we made mistakes and hopefully we will learn from them. Also pushing people off land is a cycle pretty much. I mean some indians pushed the animals off the land. Stronger indians push the other indians off the land. And so on.
