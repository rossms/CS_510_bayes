I had the pleasure of recently driving a new M-Class on a 150 mile trip. Contrary to what the whiners say this is not a huge vehicle. I found it to be comfortable and fun to drive. Part of the trip was through a blinding thunderstorm. The vehicle was extremely stable and because of the high of the seating, vision of the road was excellent. The mileage (for the ML320)is about the same as many domestic mini-vans. Overall this is a fantastic vehicle. Don't knock it unless you have driven one.
