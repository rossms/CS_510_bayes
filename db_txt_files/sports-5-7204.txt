Many things have been said about Jordan, his game, and what is behind/around of them.I don t really like comparisons, especially when people claim: who is the best ever , the greatest , the most... , etc. The majority of people, NBA fans, and mass media critics agree that Jordan is simply the best ever in this game. But, I consider than Michael is more than the best in his game. He is the last hero and a model to be followed by many kids and young people; and for a lot of adults, Jordan is the living American Dream.
