Soooooooooo good. Loaded in calories - more so than almost any other chocolate bar - but gosh they are amazing. Better than M&M's or Smarties (though both of these are also good) probably because there is more chocolate in them. By the way, they are available year round now, at least in Canada. They are themed for Easter (as usual) Halloween and Christmas so whatever time of year, they can be found.
