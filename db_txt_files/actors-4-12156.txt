Katie Holmes is the next hope for Hollywood among young actresses. She is a dazzling beautiful brunette, graced with a magnificent form, and is one of the moost exciting young talents to have come up in quite a while(the udder being Sarah Polley). She hasn't appeared in very many good films, but she always manages to outshine them. Her good films include The Gift and Go, and she is about to break out as Hollywood's Next Big lead actress. Hopefully she will manage to select quality films to show off her mooore than ample talents.
