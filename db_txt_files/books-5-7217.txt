This series is one of the best I have ever read. It starts small, focusing on just a small group, but others keep getting introduced, and growing, to the point of starting a second series just for secondary characters! His science is good, and well explained, and he has interesting ideas in that area. Also, it is not static! Science continues forward, progressing as the war does. Although the bad guys are very unsympathetic at first, that also changes, and the 'nation' interactions seem very real. Read this!
