I love this restaurant. Great food like Buffalo Shrimp, Fries, and Hamburgers. The service is the best. It is so unique and fun. The atmosphere is awesome. The only bad thing is that is is kind of expensive. People think it is such a bad place but it isn't. Go in there and your mind will change. You see more on the beach, you can even see more out on the streets or at the mall. This restaurant it great.
