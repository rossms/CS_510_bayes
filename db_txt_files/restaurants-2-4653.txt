The food is good here, but I find the waitstaff hiring to be a tad discriminatory, like many of these places. It usually hires the typical white, preppy cliqueish Abercrombie type. Many businesses practice this disgusting habit, and no, it's not done because they want competent people. It's pretty uncomfortable to eat at a restaurant that seems like some cool kid's party in high school!
