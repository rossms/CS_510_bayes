Crap, crap, crap. The PC game is incredible, but the DC version sucks horribly. The loading times are longer than the actual gameplay. Every menu option has load time. I paid $8.99 for this used, and I played it for about a week and trashed it. The graphics are bad compared to the PC version. Don't get this, get the PC version; it is really cool.
