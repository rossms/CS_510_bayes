I reckon he's one of the more underrated of the big Hollywood names and in fact has been in more winners than turkeys. 'Sixth Sense', 'Unbreakable' '5th Element', 'Die Hard' series, 'Pulp Fiction' ,the first 'Look who's talking' are some of the most watchable mainstream movies Ive seen and Im not even much of a film fan.
