Absolutely gorgeous scenery, unless you are in an industrial area. Also, you will most definitely be robbed if you go there, and not just by gypsies, though the gypsies will definitely rob you. The only way to avoid being ripped off by gypsies is to brandish a large machete at all times, but that might attract the attention of the police who will probably rob you. And do a little research before you go. While it may be funny to ask everyone you meet where you can find Dracula, unless you are in southern transylvania people will think you are completely ignorant and thus easier to rob.
