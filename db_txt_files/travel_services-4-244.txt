Being a Canadian, I have to say that we not that bad as far as service goes. We definitely offer more than American carriers offer as far as in-flight service. On a Air Canada small commuter flight I got a coffee and juice and a sandwich and yogurt and was offered a newspaper! On a flight from London(UK) to Toronto, we got tea and scones with clotted cream inbetween dinner and dinner was delicious!! Lamb and a rice that look like saffron. I have no complaints, Canucks should be proud of their airline because it FAR exceeds most U.S. carriers!!!!
