Next to Emmit Smith, Walter will go down in history as the second best running back of all time. The numbers don't lie. However, Walter will always be known for the class act he was on and off the field. The toughest running back? yes! The best, no. Barry Sanders would have eclipsed his record if he would have stayed in the league. The hapless Lions management caused that. Sweetness should have been given an opportunity to score at least 1 T.D. in 1985 when the Bears won it all. A travesty that he wasn't...He deserved it...
