Won it all his first year in town: Gruden is outstanding and the Raiders sadly wish they could have him back (Al Davis would rather eat goat scat than admit it). The Bucs will settle down in '04 now that Gruden has made it clear he is in charge rather than the primadonnas. And Bruce Allen will help him soar again!
