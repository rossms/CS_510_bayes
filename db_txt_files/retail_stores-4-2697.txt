For anyone outside the southeast US, Bi-Lo is basicly Albertson's for the mid-Atlantic states. It is not the best, by far, but since moving to Baton Rouge I mis the place. Easy access to all items, a pretty good produce section, and probably the best meat department of any store I have been to. I really enjoy doing my shopping with Bi-Lo. Problem is there isn't one in Louisiana.
