My JCPenney store had a contest in November with Mike's team (who let the dogs out) and Kathy's team (who runs from the dogs)! The loser would get a pie in the face at the end of the month. I was on Mike's team, but on Kathy's side. Just days before the end of the contest, Mike was transferred to another store! Good thing, coz Kathy's team won! And that is why I love Who Let the Dogs out!
