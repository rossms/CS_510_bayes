A smooth, lightly sweetened black tea with a mild, cinnamony zing. Amazingly, it contains no cane sugar, no corn syrup, and no artificial sweeteners! However, it does have 34 calories per 16 oz. bottle. The sweetness must come from some combination of the ginger syrup and the spices (cardamom, black pepercorns, cloves, orange peel, cinnamon, and ginger).
