I have a problem with the makers of Cast Away highlighting a non-union package delivery company in their movie. The Screen Actor's Guild takes their union very seriously (ask Elivabeth Hurley)!! Why wouldn't the makers of this movie take the Teamster's concerns with Fed Ex into consideration? Hypocrits!!!
