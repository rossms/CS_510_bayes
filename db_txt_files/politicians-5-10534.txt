An excellent leader, decision maker. Has convictions that we have no seen for 8 years. Carries baggage from the 80's, but I would rather have that than anything else the Republicans or Dems can offer at this time. With Republican control of House and Senate, and time to nominate conservative judges to many key posts, Bush will leave a legacy and be reelected in 2004 because he accomplished what others could not.
