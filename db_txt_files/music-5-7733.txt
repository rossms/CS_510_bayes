If you dont think that this is one of the best songs in history then you obviously dont have a clue about music. Slash's riff has become the most well known intro ever. The song is sheer brilliance, if you havent listened to it then your missing out on quite possibly the best song ever made. The video is amazing, watch it and u'll see what i mean. 10/10!
