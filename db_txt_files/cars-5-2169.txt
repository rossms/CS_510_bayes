I LOVE the Nissan Z series escpecially the Z32 it is a SEXY car if i muss say. The advertisements still play out in my mind clearly and all, this is defintitely a car to have. Yes Supra's are a bit faster stock for Stock, but they can both be upgraded depending on how deep your wallet is it is anyones game. Much Love 2 the Z series P.S. It's just something about A Z that just makes you ENJOY THE RIDE.
