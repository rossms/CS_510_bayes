The food's not bad. It is probably higher quality than a lot of other places, but it's a little too expensive. I like the fact that they don't charge extra for the essentials like lettuce and tomato. Those home fries are weird! They don't taste bad, just a little strange and harder to eat quickly. Overall a good place, with a few reasons I might pass them on a particular night.
