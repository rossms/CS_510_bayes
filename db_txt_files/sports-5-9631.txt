Well I'm gonna bump the Heat up a star, because they showed great heart in this series. They are definetely a more cohesive unit than the Lakers were last year. I predicted that this series was gonna go the way last years finals did. How wrong I was.....Dwayne rules!! Much better player and all around human being than Kobe, and he realizes that the big man (Shaq) runs the show. Kobe didn't realize how good he had it....Cheer up and drink a beer, and look forward to next year. We'll meet again.
