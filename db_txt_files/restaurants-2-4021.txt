I went there once, and will never go again. The food seemed like they just ran to the grocery store and picked up some pasta. I make better food than them. The so called family portions were tiny. I don't know who they think they're feeding with these portions. I am a small person who doesn't eat very much, and I left still hungry. I can't even finish a value meal from a fast food place. One last note, the decore was the ugliest I have ever seen.
