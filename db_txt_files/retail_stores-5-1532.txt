I'm going to use a Three Bears analogy to describe how I feel about the Bay. The Bon Marche looks good but its tooo expensive. Walmart is inexpensive but it just doesn't have the style or as sumptous a feeling as the Bay. And the Bay is juusst right! - not too expensive, not too plain---just right. I seriously find better products at the Bay than anywhere else. The Bay is just a good fit.
