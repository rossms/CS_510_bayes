I hope that Gov. Bush wins because I am a U.S. Military Officer and I refuse to serve under a second Comander and Chief that I do not trust. I have a letter of resighning my comission ready for submition. All it needs is to have the date put on it. Also I am not the only one of my brother officers that are going to do the same thing if that jack ass Gore wins. The enlisted are saying that they are going to refuse to re-enlist if Gore wins.
