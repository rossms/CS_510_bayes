I am specifically comment on Players Filter. They are the strongest cigarette that Players makes, although I find them to have a really crappy taste (during smoking and after). Don't get me wrong I think players makes a good canadian cig, since I am a canadian they are my favourite canadian smoke, (Players Light) to be specific. My favourite american cigarette has to be camel lights. They are a nice flavourful cigarette that has a nice and not to harsh smell. The smoke is thick and smooth, and it doesn't leave the gritty, sore feeling in your throat as most other brands do.
