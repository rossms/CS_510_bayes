Can anyone think of another actor with more animal magnatism than this man in 'Streetcar Named Desire'? Or anyone who commands more respect than this man did in 'The Godfather'? Is he the greatest actor that ever lived? Olivier fans might disagree, but the fact remains that Brando gives everything to a performance and makes lesser actors tremble from their own inadequency and audiences tremble with emotion!
