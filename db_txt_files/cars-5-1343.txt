A superb car. My 1985 528e is still going strong. BMW engineered a beauty. It has had only ONE recall on it. Like anything manufactured, there are weaknesses. Body interior is not up to a standard I would expect of this calibur of car and the electricals are of somewhat below standard (sensors like the ICV, TPS). The power train is rock solid as well as the body. They just don't make them like this anymore!!
