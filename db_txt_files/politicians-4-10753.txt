 Andrew Johnson does sound a lot like Andrew Jackson . However, it was Andrew Jackson who was so influential in establishing US policy toward Native Americans. He was known as an Indian fighter before he was president, and as president he was very much behind the Indian Removal Act. The principle responsibility for the Trail of Tears, on which so many suffered and died as they were forced to walk endless miles to be relocated away from their homes, falls on him -- not Johnson.
