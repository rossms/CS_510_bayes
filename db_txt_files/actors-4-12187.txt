Go Kiwi chick!!! Since winning her Oscar for the piano way back when (was she nine at the time!) this Kiwi (New Zealander to those not in the know) has gone from strength to strength, growing up on screen. She has range and depth to her performances, and it's only a matter of time before she gets the recognition she deserves. Go Anna!
