I've read the above comments. Coming from a single mother (alcoholic) family, at times my mom used this book as a weapon. Now, fifteen years later, the tables are turning. It seems as if I should be reading this wonderful sory (on its face that is exactly what it is, for you idiots whom choose to dig further...) and give back a taste of her own medicine. Kill 'em with kindness. Works for me. If you want to psychoanalyze meaning define it for yourself, look in the mirror, and DEFINE WHAT YOU SEE. Leave Shel S. out of it.
