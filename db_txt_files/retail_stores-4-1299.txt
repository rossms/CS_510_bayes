as a teenager(who DOES look for bargains), i'd have to say i really like nordstrom's! like other's have mentioned, they really don't have low priced stuff....but if you are willing to buy something even if it's a little overpriced, look in nordstroms! I ALWAYS find clothing, makeup, etc. there! They have so many dresses, shoes, clothing, etc.....! great store and i love to shop there......
