Thriller defined a whole new era of video making. Back when music video's were consisted of watching bands play on an empty stage, Thriller gave us a creepy storyline mixed with great dancing. Whenever I have doubts to as to why I liked Michael Jackson I just refer back to his old stuff and it brings up some great memories. Had he died before the 90's hit people would have worshipped him like they do Elvis.
