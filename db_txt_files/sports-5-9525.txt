kobefan: what have you been smokin! i want some! the lakers wont have a prayer in hell of beating the pistons, or any other team for that matter. detroit will repeat. the lakers wont be sh*t this season. neither will dallass or nutsac-ramento. the only challenge the pistons will have this year will be themselves.
