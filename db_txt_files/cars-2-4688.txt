turn this baby down for 4runner. i test drove a 4 door tacoma. GOOD: rommy, looks..... BAD:... (price: the truck does not worth the price), (POWER: this thing cried like it is about to die when i barely press on the accelerator), feeling the road too much..... BOTTOM Line: unless we are rating on different vehicle... i have no idea why this truck get such high rating.
