Prices are alright, and they have some clothes that I like, but I find it hard to find anything in there, and I have never had anyone offer me any help. They were too busy talking to their friends. I also like rock n roll music, but I don't like it shattering my eardrums when I'm trying to shop for clothes. HINT HINT.
