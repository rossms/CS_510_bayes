A real stinkeroo. Neither suspensful nor funny. I probably slept through a quarter of it. My general beef with any of these remakes is that you know what's going to happen. But every movie just has to have a remake nowadays. I vision myself 30 years in the future, cringing at the movie theater watching the trailer for the remake of Rocky.
