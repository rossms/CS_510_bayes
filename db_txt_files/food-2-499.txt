Munson was right on target. What happened to the old Apple Jacks? I had a bowl today, and it was not the cereal I remember with fondness from my childhood. This cereal was smaller and not nearly as airy, and the thick layer of frosting I loved dearly was gone. The apple pieces were practically non-existent, and I was dismayed to find that half of the jacks were green. Horrors! The worst part was that the new Apple Jacks simply didn't taste very good. Boohoo...
