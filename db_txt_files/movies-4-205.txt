While sometimes a little hard to believe (the fictional romances etc.), Braveheart still works on many levels. Some of the best fight sequences ever made, Gibson is outstanding - in both the directors chair AND the lead role, and the ending is sad and effective. Summary: A WONDERFUL FILM WITH GREAT FIGHT SCENES.
