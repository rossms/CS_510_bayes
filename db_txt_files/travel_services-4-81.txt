This airline is the living embodiment of the coy philosophy: Get In, Sit Down, Shut Up, Hold On. I remember a flight when an attendant said, Here are the instructions for using your oxygen mask. After you stop screaming... I like Southwest because the fares are not very high and the crews pride themselves on a relaxed professionalism with a friendly attitude. The seats are a little small if you are fat or seated next to a plump passenger; but the short-hauls I prefer on this airline do not make that a forbidding condition. Worth looking up whenever you shop for fares.
