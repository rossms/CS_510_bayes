What a disappointment. After looking forward to trying this well-respected beer with its cool little bottles, and neat looking custom glasses, I finally got the chance to try one the other night. Chimay tastes a heck of a lot more like wine, than it does beer. The flavor and high alcohol content made my head spin (and not in a good way), and as my friend put it, made me not thirsty any more. Very overrated.
