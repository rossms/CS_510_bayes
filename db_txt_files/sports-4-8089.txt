If thr 76ers trade my man AI, I will no longer be a sixers fan. Iverson is the person who made me start watching the sixers again. I feel bad for he because sometimes it seems as though he is not appreciated. Well I love his game and I hope the get him and the team help. This can be done by getting a power center or a fantastic three point shooter, not by trading him.
