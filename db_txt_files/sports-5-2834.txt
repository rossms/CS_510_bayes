Lloyd McClendon is great.. He is an overweight hot head fiery african american.. if anyone else was him, they'd be in prison.. so he must be smart and great to have avoided that.. Once he is fully accepted by the baseball community as a great manager, he will lead the pirats to a championship, it might just take a few more years.
