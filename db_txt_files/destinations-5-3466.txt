I love this place. I have so much fun everytime I go here. There is lots to do, shopping, nightlife, restaurants, historic stuff etc. It's all great. Other people seem to think that the people are rude, but I really liked the people here. They are honest and funny, unlike in Philadelphia or New York. The only thing I don't like is that the T(there public transportation) isn't 24 hours. Other than that this city is WONDERFUL!
