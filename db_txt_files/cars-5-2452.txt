An all-weather, all-wheel-drive sports car. The only one of its kind so far, although others may be on the way. Very quick, tossable, and entertaining. It does 0-60 in less than 6 seconds and takes corners with agility. Slight turbo lag, but not if you keep the rpms up above 3,000. Comes in sedan and wagon forms; the sedan is faster (being 80 pounds lighter), but the wagon is more versatile and (in my opinion) sharper-looking. Go get one!
