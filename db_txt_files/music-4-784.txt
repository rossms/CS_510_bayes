I really enjoyed Fiona's first CD 'Tidal,' so I had high expectations for this one, and in most ways I haven't been disappointed. 'When the Pawn' is definitely a CD that needs to grow on you, and I haven't listened to it enough to really like it yet, but I'm already impressed with Fiona's growth as a singer and songwriter. This CD is much more mature than 'Tidal' - really impressive for someone so young (what is she - like 20?).
