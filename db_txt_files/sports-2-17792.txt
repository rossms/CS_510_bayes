Losing Marvin Lewis hopefully wasn't disastrous for the defense. I know they were top 10, but when you look at the players they have, they could have done so much more this year now that they learned the system. Still, with the right coach, they should be an anchor for this team. If they can have a receiver emerge, and if young Patrick Ramsey can play with some consistency, they might do some damage this year.
