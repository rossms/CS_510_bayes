The first new GTA game is probably still the best just because of its revolutionary design and massive appeal of many video gamers. I remember playing this game for the first time and being blown away by it, just because I had seen nothing like it before. Yeah, Vice City and San Andreas are great in their own respect, but this is the game that started it all.
