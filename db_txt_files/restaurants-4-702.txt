pretty good except they go up in price every year. they have a good variety of icecream treats to choose from. Soft serve icecream cones to sundaes of all kinds of flavors, blizzards with different concoctions to make up. banana splits to other types of parfaits. even hotdogs and hamburgs. not a bad place some good tasting treats.
