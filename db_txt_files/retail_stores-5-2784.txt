absoultly beautiful stores! very detail oriented right down to the extra room they have for your children to watch tv while you browse without distraction. great smiling faces, professional people and quality peices! i didn't go in there to buy and i still felt like a million bucks when i left with the service i received! finally a jewelery store that can balance beauty with reality! thank you mayor's!
