Roy s is so classy. He forms good relationships with his teams on and off the court. He checks to make sure they're going to class and doing what they need to be doing to succeed in all areas of life. He pushes his team to do their best in a positive way. I think he's a prime example of what a coach should be and I really hope he stays at KU! We love you Roy!
