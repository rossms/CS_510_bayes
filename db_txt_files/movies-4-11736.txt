This movie is the next addition to the formulaic teenlove/fluff genre and hopeless romantic that I am, I saw it this weekend. It actually surprised me. While certainly not ground-breaking, it's very enjoyable. Very funny and sweet, the actors managed to pull off a so-so storyline. Topher Grace shined in his comedic talents in his first lead movie role. Kate Bosworth was beautiful and endearing in her portrayal of a virtuous country girl. Josh DuHamel, Nathan Lane and Sean Hayes were hilarious, all adding to this above par romantic comedy flick.
