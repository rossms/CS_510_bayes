Being 18, I was once a child, and I LOVED this book. I would read the poems over and over. This book gave me inspiration for my first piece of memorization. Shel Silverstein is an amazing writer. The simple illustrations only add to the enjoyment. I know I will want my children to be familiar with this author and his work.
