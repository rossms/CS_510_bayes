Make a fried pepper sandwich and a feta salad for lunch. Take some high grade sweet peppers, slice and fry or saute them in olive oil. Add your favorite spices to taste. Get a Vidalia onion, if you can--celery--crunchy lettuce-black olives--green olives--chop and throw it all together in a salad. Add lots of feta on top and pour balsamic vinegar and oil all over it. Take sweet butter and slather it on hard crusty bread--put your peppers in between the slices as a pepper sandwich--pour hot oil from the pan on the peppers in the sandwich. Break out a bottle of hearty red wine and enjoy!
