Rumors around Washington DC had it that John Riggins liked to drink and then hop in his car and pick up really young girls. All I know for sure about him is that he used to bulldoze his way through the NFC East - particularly the Cowboys. The Redskins were the masters of that Counter running play with Riggins in there. He was just a hard working, nose to the grindstone back that any team would have loved to have on their roster.
