Another look at reality from Bill O' Reilly. Each chapter is divided into interviews he has had with many of the important and so-called important poeple of our society talking about several controversial issues. Agree or disagree with him more, at least there's a person who will state his beliefs and base them on facts. Most interviewers will not be fully honest or ask the questions that either everyone else is asking or are the most important. The books also gives insight to who are the genuine articles and charlatans of the world.
