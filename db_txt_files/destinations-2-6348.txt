There's really nothing particularly great about Ohio. Nearly half of it is uninteresting flatlands, and about another half is old worn-out cities. The remaining little bit is some interesting small towns (including Amish Country ) nestled among some rolling hills; those redeeming qualities are the only reason the state isn't terrible.
