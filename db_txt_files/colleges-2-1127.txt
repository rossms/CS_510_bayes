Possibly the unfriendliest campus I have ever known. I was here for a bit to write part of my doctoral dissertation--and encountered nothing but rudeness, egotism and vile provincialism. Stop to talk to someone and they'll look at their watch and say they have to go. I hated being treated like a terrorist. I think Harvard is a cult.
