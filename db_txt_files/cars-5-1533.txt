I have a 1996 SL2 with 52000 miles. It has been a very reliable car to date and very inexpensive to own. The car is comfortable, and fairly quiet. Excellent power and handling make it fun to drive. You can kick the body panels and they will not crack or dent, but they will scratch if hit by a 1986 Chevy Monte Carlo Door. Have only done scheduled maintenance on the car. Brakes wore out quickly and tend to build up rust if car sits. Dealer replaced brakes and rotors under warrenty. Has used no additional oil to date.
