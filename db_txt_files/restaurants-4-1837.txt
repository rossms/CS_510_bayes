This is pretty good food at a decent price. I keep in mind it is okay for fast food. I do know that if i want real Mexican food i will go to one of the cities authentic Mexican restaurants.this is okay food and my kids love Taco Bell. and they do have a large selection to pick from.They also get credit for trying to come up with new foods to try.
