I don't know what you're all going on about. Here in Canada you make okay money, plus you train a lot to get yourself ready for the position. Radio Shack employees are not idiots (okay, maybe the new people are. I know I was). I think you all need to just relax and visit a Canadian store or something. Maybe we have different guidelines there, but I greet every customer I see...
