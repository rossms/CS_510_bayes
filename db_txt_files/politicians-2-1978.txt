I don't think what jrmanson said is true. she's not just taxing rich people she's attacking the middle class and middle class school systems. my education is important to me, it's too bad it's not important to granholm. my school has had to cut numerus programs and we have to work on rediculus budgets. college tutiton has gone ky high in michigan and granholm says we have to make these sacrifices if we want to pay off the stat debt, but she's bleeding the schools dry. forget about rich people, middle class people, or poor people granholm just isn't in touch with any people.
