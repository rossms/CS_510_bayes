this is a cute movie. A spoiled prince,is nasty to everyone around him.An evil lady who can do magic tries to do away with the prince and he gets turned into a Llama instead. John Goodman plays a character who befriends the Llama -prince and helps him to get home to turn him back. There are some humorous scenes along the way and of course the spoiled prince-Llama changes into a nicer person and everyone lives happily ever after. predictalble but a pretty good Disney movie and it would not be too boring for adults to sit through.the kids of course would probably like this too.
