All great lakes cities are some of the greatest places in america to live. I live just 60 miles east of here in Rochester. Nice people, good food (wings) and the weather isn't as bad as people say it is. If it would have not relied so heavily on the steel industry for so long it wouldn't be in the economic shape it is now. But it's sad, it really is a great city.
