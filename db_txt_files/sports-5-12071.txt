Having seen most of the games the Caddy played in his career on the plains, I can tell you that he is going to be a special player in the NFL. The knocks on Williams are his size and his speed, but many of the greatest backs of all time are the same size; Emmitt Smith, Barry Sanders, etc., and if you've ever seen him get outside on those speedy SEC linebackers and find that pie-line, then you wouldn't be worried about his forty time. Bottom line, Cadillac runs like a 240 pounder, can go from zero to gone in the blink of an eye, and has more heart than any player I've ever watched play.
