The gold standard as far as American cigarettes are concerned. Full bodied, rich flavor with the best draw you'll find, while still smoother than some of the budget full flavor competition. Their only downside is the premium price they pull down and that slight ammonia aftertaste, which isn't usually that present if you buy them in the soft packs.
