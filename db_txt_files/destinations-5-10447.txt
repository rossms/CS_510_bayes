The perfect cigaratte! Good tasting and really makes your lungs feel good. I've been smoking newport box 100s for almost 15 years now and was my first brand. The key to enjoing newport is making sure you're always buying fresh packs. When they're fresh, they're smooth. Contrary to popular rumor, newports and all other menthol cigarettes don't contain fiberglass. You guys are just too funny.
