The sine qua non of gins. If you're a martini fan, this is the gin you're looking for. If you're a gin and tonic person, don't waste your money as you won't taste what makes this stuff so special. Try doing a dry gin martini with Hendrick's, skipping the olive and going for a slice of cuke instead.
