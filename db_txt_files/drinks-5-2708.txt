Actually, I have generally always enjoyed Starbucks coffee and the Starbucks chain itself since I first started drinking coffee. The service is typically fast but friendly, with the atmosphere being sophosticated yet not at all intimidating. As for the coffee itself...well, personally I enjoy it but views do seem to vary quite a bit.
