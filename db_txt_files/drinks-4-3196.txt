Nice. But why is it in the top slot? It's a very good gin. But all you can taste is the juniper. It needs a little more subtlety. Bombay Malacca and Hendrick's are more complex and flavorful, and for the money a much better bet. Don't mix this stuff with tonic water or OJ. Sapphire is for your classic Winston Churchill style Martini: slightly bruised by the ice cubes, but untainted by the vermouth.
