Best of all-time. Just look and the numbers 11 seasons he hit 40+ homeruns, 13 100+ rbi seasons, 3 season with 200+ hits. He even stole over 100 bases, hit over 500 doubles, 136 triples, and let's not forget his unbelievable 714 career homeruns. So with a .342 lifetime batting average and a 2 time 20 game winner as a pitcher, Babe Ruth should certainly at least be considered for the greatest player in baseball history.
