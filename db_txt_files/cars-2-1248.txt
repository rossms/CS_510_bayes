I have had a 2002 Altima for about 2 years now. The transmission is leaking, the brakes are shot, the gas tank does not open, and there is a leak in the seal of the windshield. The dealer gives me nothing but problems when I bring the car in for service, and nothing is ever covered under the warranty. This is my first and last Nissan purchase.
