A natural wonder well worth a visit. I've never seen anything like it, but of course, who has? The vastness of the cave system here is incredible, no way to see it all in any short amount of time. Some of the cave trails are pretty heavily trafficked, but the spectacle is a wonder to behold just the same. Try one or two of the longer and/or wilder cave tours. A great family vacation spot.
