This is a fantastic park and a great example of what can be done to preserve some of our country's wilderness. No private vehicles are allowed into the interior of the park so you have to ride park buses that drop you off wherever you like. There are not trails you just hike and get picked up on another bus road. The mountain itself (if you get a chance to see it it's rarely visible) is magnificent. I can't wait to go back.
