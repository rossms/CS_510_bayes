Excellent book, with continuing character development along with the introduction of new, memorable characters. An 870 page book could have had a lot of slow spots in it, but Rowling manages to steer clear of that common occurence. It would be hard to rank this one compared to the others, but I would probably put it as second, right behind the Sorceror's Stone. Can't wait until the next one.
