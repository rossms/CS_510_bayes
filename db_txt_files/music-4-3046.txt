All great songs but you can tell the Beatles were getting burnt out. It could be 5 stars but I can tell they didn't put their all into project. Phil Spector actually saved the album with beautiful string arrangments on Winding Road , I Me Mine , and Across The Universe . And to think The Beatles thought the orchestrated songs sounded terrible. They just didn't have their head in the game anymore. I LOVE the song I've Got A Feeling , what a hell of an intro riff that sticks in your head. A classy way to play the G and C chord.
