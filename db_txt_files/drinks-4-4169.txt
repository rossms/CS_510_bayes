If you want the tangy sweet/sour/citrus flavor of a lemon drop in your rum, this is the drink for you. Like any other good flavored rum, it's very drinkable straight. Not much complexity -- it's just lemon drop + alcohol -- but I hope that's not what you're looking for in a flavored rum. Worth the $14 I paid for a fifth.
