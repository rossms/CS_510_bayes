I tried several Menthol cigarettes, Salem, Newport, Cool, and nothing is comparable to Marlboro ones. I love Full Flavor Marlboro Menthol, in fact just today I got NEW pack of M.M. with Silver box (old white area is now silver). I am not sure was this promotional package (filter is shorter too, whole box is shorter) or intent to change it to silver package, but it looks nice to me. Anyway, I like minty stuff, like icecream, chewing gums,junior mints etc, so Malboro Menthol full flavor does it for me:)
