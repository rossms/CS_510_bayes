Missouri has a lot of rolling green hills in the spring and in the winter time, it is really kind of ugly. Avoid this time of year. The state is pretty much shut down. Branson is alright. I would venture to say that it is over rated. If you go, you have to go see Dixie Stampede. Its a hoot! If you want a little southern hospitality deep in the Ozarks, go to Eureka Springs, Ark. (located just south of Branson) and rent a cabin. They have a lot to do there also.
