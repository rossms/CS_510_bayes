I would give him four points just for being the legend he was.For an awful lot of years he was a hero to many.The cowboy that some looked up to. A true patriot. i have not seen a lot of his movies but as an actor he was pretty good. Not great.He pretty much played the type of role.He was my dad's favorite actor.hands down.
