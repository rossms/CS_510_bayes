Mars are awesome! they're so dense and sweet and you dont get any kind of nuts stuck in your teeth just rich chocolate and barely noticeable caramel flavor in every bite. They're filling and would satisfy any craving for someting sweet or chocolatey. Mars and snickers aren't the same, real mars bars are hard to find in the states - the UK and Canada has the original, really good, ones.
