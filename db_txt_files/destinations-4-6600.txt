My family is from the Hawkeye State so I really can't bash it. The people there are friendly, family oriented and intelligent. Iowa has some of the best education of any state. It may not have any beautiful mountains or an ocean, but it has a simple midwest beauty. It's largest city Des Moines is no Chicago, Boston, New York or Philadelphia in terms of culture, but you might be surprised as to what it has to offer. Oh yeah you can't beat the Iowa corn and beef.
