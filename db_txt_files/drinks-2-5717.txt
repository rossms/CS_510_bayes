I was raised coke, and still to this day prefer the original to pepsi and other cola's, but this stuff isn't good. Every bottle or can i have had has been flat no matter what the date, and it has a very chemical taste. If i want a vanilla coke I'll go to the drug store soda fountain and get a REAL vanilla coke, with a touch of half and half and whipped cream. yum yum.
