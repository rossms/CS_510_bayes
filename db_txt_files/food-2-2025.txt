I've had them a few times, always with a good amount of time in between and I always have the same response; for some reasons jr caramels are just too hard. The chocolate does not taste the same as the one used for Jr. Mints, basically it has no taste, just like a sort of dull plastic textured coating over a really hard piece of caramel that never melts in your mouth and leaves a chemical aftertaste.
