Refreshingly light, smooth, with no bitter after-taste - simply the best beer I've ever tasted. It's customary for certain Venezualan bars/restaurants to specifically serve icicle-covered botttles of this beer to their customers, in keeping with it's moniker, Polar. I'm uncertain whether it's available at all outside of Venezuala - it should be!
