Circuit City for the most part is OK. I agree with Wiggum, there constant up-sale wears thin on your patience. No I don t want your stupid maintenance contract on everything I buy. Are you telling me your products are garbage? And they do tend to be more on the aggressive side. This is one of those places I go to buy what I already know I want and have done my product research. In and out as quick as possible. If you do get in and window shop they will never leave you alone.
