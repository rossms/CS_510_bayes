I don't believe a coach is a good coach solely based on the number of wins he has. Beamer HAS the wins along with an incredible character and work ethic. I was getting my hair cut recently right along side the coach and from what he said and from what others have said about him, he's one of the hardest workers I've ever heard of. He's respectful, he's strong (note the game he coached last week mere hours after his mother passed away), and he's determined. What other coach in this country can you say that about?
