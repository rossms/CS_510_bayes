Excellent stores! There is a nice mix of upscale gourmet and popular items. I can choose either to splurge, or spend no more than if I were shopping at a local Giant or Safeway store. They usually have good sale items as well. I'm trying to convince them to open a store closer to my house. As far as the rater who compared them to Wegmans, puhlease! Wegmans is simply Costco for the Land Rover set.
