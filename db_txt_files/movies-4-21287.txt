Its an okay movie in my opinion, a bit overrated by all Newsies fan girls. And a bit annoying with all the songs and strange with boys in newsies outfits dancing like that, but still a very enjoyable and fun movie. It never struck me as funny, and at first i didnt like it, but later i started to enjoy it and watch it more often. I like David Moscow better than Christian Bale though (he's overrated in my opinion, and everyone's favorite of the two.) This movie was fun, had wonderfully, upbeat songs and enjoyable dance moves. You want be dissapointed!
