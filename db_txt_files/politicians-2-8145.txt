I have Nixon in front of him on my list. Kennedy could have been good, not great, but during his presidency he was bad. It pains me to give him a 2 instead of a 1, but he was not terrible. He incorrectly handled the Bay of Pigs and that was obvious. There was nothing courageous of his admitting the mistake but rather an attempt on his part to save his ass which worked. He had an approval rating just shy of 80, a remarkable number. He was a peoples' president, not a government president. Clearly overrated.
