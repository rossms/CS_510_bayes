You all spoke a little too soon this year. Have you seen the role that they're on. They'll be fighting for the Eastern championship and maybe even another ring this year. They have about the same record as last year and I feel they are getting warmer to win the east. Just hope I'm not completely wrong and they fall apart like they were early in the season.
