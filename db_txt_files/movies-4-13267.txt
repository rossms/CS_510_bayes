This is a great movie. It's pretty long, but gives you a good idea of what soldiers had to go thru durring WWII. I have to say though, that I am sort of apalled of the fact that right now, it is airing on TNT, completely uneditied, with all of the language, and extreme goar. This movie should not be available fot little kids to watch on TV!!!!!
