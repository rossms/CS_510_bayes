Fantastic! The scariest game I've played in a long time, and an outstanding achievement in graphics. It's less like Doom and more like System Shock 2 (without the role-playing elements). There are moments of sheer terror. This one must be experienced to be believed... but only if you're armed with a ridiculously-good system.
