Another Jim Henson's puppets fueled magical movie, with no human actors present. This was on my list of favs as a kid, I still like it today. It features masterful storytelling, great fantasy, and is marvelous all the way through. A gelfling is sent on a mission to heal the cracked crystal to restore good and harmony to his world. It was, quite simply, a wonderful (different) movie!
