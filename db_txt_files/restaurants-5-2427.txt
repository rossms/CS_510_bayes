Excellent overall. The prices are just right. A Jumbo Jack with cheese is perfect. It's cheap and includes tomatoes and lettuce, unlike McDonald's where you have to choose between the various evil burgers that leave something out or include something I don't want. Their onion rings are also the perfect size. Their batter doesn't fall off because they are small and sturdy, not getting crushed as they're shoved in the box. Drive-thru window is fast and open until the right hours.
