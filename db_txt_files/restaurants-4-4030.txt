A fun place to take a large group. THe food is served family style, meaning they give you lots of it for a moderate price. The Buca chains tries just a little to hard to capture the feeling of an old-style Italian family eatery, and somehow misses the mark. It often comes across as staged and as friendly as a bad dinner theater production. The food is good, but not great. For a more authentic Italian feel, try and locate a small family operated resturant. But for a close imitatation, Buca fits the bill.
