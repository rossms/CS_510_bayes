I think Tubby is a pretty good coach. But take it from me; I'm a black and old Kentucky native and a diehard fan, Kentucky fans are the meanest in the country! They are critical, unfair and always looking for a reason to send him if he doesn't meet their standards. I feel thatthe fans live for men's basketball. Right now women's basketball and the football team are pitiful. If it wasn't for tubby, Ky sports would be nowhere!
