My favorite European city, and probably my favorite city. It's modern but it's maintained a beautiful atmosphere with the narrow cobblestone streets and a number of street performers. I'm big into Mozart so it was neat to see his birth-house and summer house though I sadly didn't get to tour them. And for all you Sound of Music fans, you've got the concert hall, convent, gorgeous Mirabell Gardens, I Am Sixteen... pavillion, (thought the movie was actually filmed only in the latter two). Salzburg is wonderful.
