I like the track son this album, but Some of the songs are just remakes 3 to be exact. and there's 1 interlude-outro track that is britney's dear diary which it is a good outro. now for teh rest of the album, the track oops I did it again has the baby one more time beat and sounds and has the same arrangements. which it's ok to use once an a while but they use that same beat and arrangments throught parts of the cd. Thats is my only downside of this cd. it does have some tunes to dance to and the remake of satisfaction is better than the original.
