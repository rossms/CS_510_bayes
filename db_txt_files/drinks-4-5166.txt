I've personally always preferred Coke, but Pepsi is good too. I don't notice a whole lot of difference between the two (die-hard Pepsi fans are shaking their heads at me right now). Pepsi is a bit stronger, I think...sometimes it seems a little too acidic and hard to swallow. But I lost a tad bit of respect for Pepsi when they hired Miss Britney Spears to dance around half-naked in order to promote their product. Sex does sell, but do we really have to drag sex into it in order to sell a soft drink? Oy, what is this world coming to?
