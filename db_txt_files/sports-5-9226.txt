I LOVE JALEN ROSE SOOOOO MUCH. I have love this man since I seen him play back in 93. I love this man so much I named my daughter jalen in 93. She is an avid basketball player at 8yrs old. Jalen doesn't seem to get the props he deserves. He's quick, talented, and shows great leadership qualities. He works great under pressure. He is a wonderful person. I love ya Jalen, if you ever get a chance to read this. I hope one day that Jalen I will get to meet you. Love, your biggest fan ladydimples
