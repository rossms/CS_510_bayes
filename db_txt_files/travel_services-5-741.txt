Rented a Civic Hybrid from the Orange County/John Wayne Airport location. I will say it was a bit of a drive to their location, but our car was there and ready. We loved the car, loved the price, have no complaints really. I will say that they are slower than a national chain place and did ask for employer name and if we had a copy of our insurance card, but other than that nothing too exciting. The return did go a bit slow because there were 4 people in line in front of us to pick up cars, but that's just the chance you take, when we picked-up we were the only ones there. I'd definitely do this again!
