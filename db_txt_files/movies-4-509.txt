Frankly, I've never really considered this to be in the same league as the Godfather movies, but it is still a great movie. When I think of this one, I always remember the scene where Joe Pesci borrows his mother's big knife, and then he goes and offs that guy with it, stabbing him as he's laying there half dead in the trunk of the car. It's pretty gruesome, but a very memorable scene.
