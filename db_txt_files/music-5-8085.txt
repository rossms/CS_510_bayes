TOOL are always innovators when it comes to music videos. They are also the most underrated and unappreciated artists in the format. This was the one that started it all. Euipped with a new and stellar animation style, concept of the video fits the depressing and longing tone and lyrics of the song. One will also notice that the band does not appear in the video except for a few snipits here and there. Some believe that the artist must be shown in order for a song or video to connect to people. Yet, the video for sober became a hit beasically without the band's visual presence.
