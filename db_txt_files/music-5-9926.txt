This CD contains my one and only all time favorite song, wich is why it deserves a 5 for grade. I loved this song, and like Ally McBeal has Searching my soul I have Feeling so good . Whenever I here that song of mine, I can t help it, but I just start smiling. And then Waiting fo tonight ain t bad either. Yet, I m not even temped to by her new album J.Lo since I belive that 0n the 6 is hard to top. And too dance, do not get the idea of dancing in Jen s own clothing line, La Lopez, since those thight thingies were not made for hips like hers...
