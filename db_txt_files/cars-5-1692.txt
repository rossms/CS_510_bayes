Long forgotten by most people, the Buick Park Avenue (the doctors car) is still around, and coud not be much better. It is a large luxury yatch, one of the few to still offer seating for 6. It comes in 2 trim levels, Base and Ultra. This Buick has always been a reliable, solid vehicle that has good resale value. An under rated vehicle.
