I purchased a Deep Wedgewood blue Escape XLS in March and I absolutly LOVE it.I really like the size othe vehicle, plenty of room in the interior, and I like the look on the exterior. I was not really intereated int the escape until I test drove it and fell in love with it. It handles very well and has a lot of pep. If you want one definatly got with the v6, it is worth it. So far I am a very happy Escape owner!
