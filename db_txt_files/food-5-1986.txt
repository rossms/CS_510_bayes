The candy Now and Later is great, especially for college students. Other than the obvious fact that it's cheap and comes in a variety of flavors, it's also long lasting. Being in college, often times you find yourself lost and hungry, and Now and Later will satisfy your palate till you get home. It will take awhile to finish. A pack only costs about 25 cents.
