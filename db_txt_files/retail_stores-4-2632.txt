It's really not as bad to work for Kroger as people keep saying. I get paid fairly well, and they will work around your hours as long as you're willing to work with them and be flexible. Management gets on my nerves a lot and can act corrupt, but that can be found just about anywhere. The store where I work is one of the busiest ones in the Cincinnati area, and it is very clean. The produce and meat are much fresher than Wal-Mart's, and our prices are only slightly more expensive.
