I guess the rating is for the building (and not for the city of Agra) in which case it is certainly worth the money. I saw the Yanni performance there under the moonlight which was a great experience. However, it is a difficult experience keeping Photgraphers, Guides, Souvenir Sellers and others at bay, who are uniquely persistent. Don't get ripped off into paying for keeping your shoes in the rack while U walk the building becos it is supposed to be for free. Anyway, while U are in Agra, do not forget the Red Fort, U would rarely see castles so grand in size and detail.
