Absolutely superb! Wonderful series. Yes, they do get a bit repetitive after awhile, but they're still great. Jacques does a great job leaving some to the imagination and describing in detail certain things that make us happy (such as all the succulent food). Anybody that never reads these is missing out on something special.
