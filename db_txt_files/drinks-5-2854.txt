I recently bought a jar of Maxwell House Instant Decaffienated coffee and was thoroughly impressed! A rich, satisfying cup of coffee that tastes alot better than alot of real coffee. And especially that it is decaffienated it is extra-wonderful. You can have it late at night without worrying about caffiene keeping you up. Plus it's perfect to have on hand for vistors who drop by who can't have caffiene. (My father has an irregular heartbeat and his doctor told him to avoid caffiene.) This coffee is ideal to take to work when you have only a kettle or microwave available too. mmmmm!
