I think Jon Gruden is a great offensive coach. He has helped Brad Johnson become a decent QB over this past season...just think what next year will bring. On top of keeping the offense strong, he and his coaching staff have mananged to produce one heck of a defense!! Not only is he a great coach...he is also sexy as hell!!!
