Ok people I am the biggest damn MJ fan ever and I am on here to tell you alittle fact. I am not sayin that Jordan was the greatest College player BUT he def. isn't "Overrated". the guys got College Player of the year 2 years in arow and got Championship MVP in 1982 when they won the finals when he made the final shot. Sooooo before ya'll start actin like you know your ish get the facts then talk your ish. just remember you don't have to be the best in college to be the best of all time.
