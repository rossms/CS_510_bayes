My first exposure to the Hurricane was at a house party when I was at Georgetown University. This very wealthy kid from New Orleans decided to have a Mardi Gras theme party in which he shipped in real Hurricane glasses from some famous New Orleans bar as well as the ingredients. The party was good, and I really like the idea of a city having a drink to call it's own. Like a cheesesteak in Philadelphia, a burrito in San Francisco - why not a mixed drink?
