Listen to this CD if you need help getting up early on a Monday morning. Black Day has story beats and lyrics that will keep you guessing (silly willy woman?). When The Love Breaks has excellent drum work by John Bonhom(sp?) and if you can't appreciate the beauty of the Stairway to Heaven, than shame on you.
