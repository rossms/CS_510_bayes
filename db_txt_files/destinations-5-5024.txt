Okay, we all get it...NEW YORK IS NOT JUST A CITY. Well thank you very much, but I believe we have that one figured out by now and your redundancy (not to mention overbearing and condescending) is more annoying than any misconception anyone has about this state or any other. That said, New York is great -a mini nation in one state -the ocean, mountans, huge lakes, beautiful countryside, hustle and bustle, or a smoother quieter way of life. Best shopping and entertainment in the world...and Christmas in New York...well, it's what they make movies about. I'll give it a five.
