A scary guy. No matter how talented he is, I would not want him on my football team - not if I were a Ravens' coach, fan, or player. Mike Ditka made a nice point on the CBS pregame show - that Lewis' coach has to know by now if Lewis is a good guy who has made a couple of bad decisions, or if he is just flat out a bad guy. Ditka went on to say that if in fact Lewis is a bad guy (as it would appear), he's gotta go.
