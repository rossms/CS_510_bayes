I bought this CD expecting more industrial size metal by rock legend Alice Cooper. I loved Brutal Planet but thought Dragontown wasn't quite as good. To my surprise, Alice decided to do some different things on this CD. You have a few songs that sound like they could beon Dragontown, but for the most part this is an old school, very diverse album. The thing rocks and Alice sounds great. No two songs are the same, and it gets better with each listen. Recommended.
