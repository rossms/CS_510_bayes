I don't care what any previous posts say about Barry Alvarez. You can stack him up against other, more legendary and successful college football coaches, speculate how he would have done had he coached in another conference or how much greater success he would have seen had he had better talent on his teams, but it boils down to this: he is the greatest coach in Wisconsin football history. And for long-suffering Badger fans who lived through years and years of horrible football prior to his tenure, that's all that matters. We'll miss you Barry! Thanks for everything you've done.
