A great album,even for Dylan.From the cynical "Rainy day women" through the lush "Visions of Johanna" to the inimitable "Stuck inside of Mobile with the Memphis Blues Again",the raucious "Leopard skin pillbox hat" and my favorite cut "Obviously 5 Believers",this album showcases some of the awesome diversity and originality that keeps many of us interested in this artist regardless of some clunkers and cranky moments with the press.
