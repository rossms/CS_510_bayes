If you can recognize a director's work without knowing whose it is, that can be good or bad. If the director's fine unique touch is evident, good. But if you look at the screen and see Jay and Silent Bob AGAIN!, you know the heavy hand of Kevin was here. Other factors are just as unpleasantly recognizable. When the director's viewpoint overwhelms the story, that's not cool. Why 4 stars, then? When he's not detracting from the story, it's a damn good story.
