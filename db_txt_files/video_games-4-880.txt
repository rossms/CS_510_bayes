I had electronic battleship growing up, and it was pretty cool. You typed in the coordinates that you wished to fire upon, and hit a red launch button which made the sound of a missile being fired. When you actually hit something, there was a dramatic crash. The only annoying part was programming in all of the coordinates of your pieces - one wrong move and you had to start all over again.
