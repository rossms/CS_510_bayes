Not my favorite (the CD issue is MUCH better than the vinyl, at least in the U.S., where they ripped this album apart for release on Capitol). The title track, You've Got to Hide Your Love Away and of course Yesterday can't be matched. But there is too much fluff here (Another Girl, The Night Before).
