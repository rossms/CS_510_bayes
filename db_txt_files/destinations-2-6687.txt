This midwestern state seems to be mostly inhabited by southern hicks and red necks that are still conflicted by the states confusion on slavery 150 plus years ago. Sorry to say the pro slavery intolerant group have won. A sorry hell hole for the most part that is dumb, backward and going nowhere but down.
