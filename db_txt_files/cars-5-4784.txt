I bought my Ford Ranger Edge Supercab in August. It is a 2003 model. I love it! It drives like alot bigger trucks would. I drove it in the snow, fields and in the woods during hunting season. I loved how it had plenty of power and traction. Mine has the 4.0 under the hood. I made the right choice buying this truck.
