Better than SFO in so many ways... better weather... less traffic... Very few delays. BART is about 2 miles away compared to SFO direct line in ( only 3 years old). BART will connect directly to OAK in the near future with a planned monorail. Can get crowded during holidays... but traffic moves smoothly.
