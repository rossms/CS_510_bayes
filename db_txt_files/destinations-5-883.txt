Very passionate country and people...full of other Europeans who live there now, so avoid the coasts if you want a flavour of real Spain. Spain has become a clean and dynamic country, has the world's best health service, is open to a new and modern society, yet keeps many traditions and fiestas...you'll definitely enjoy yourself here.
