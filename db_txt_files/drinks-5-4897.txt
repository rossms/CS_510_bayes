Royal Crown Cola is the ideal synthesis of the two leading soft drinks in this country (and elsewhere). More mellow than Coca-Cola, but nowhere near as syrupy as Pepsi-Cola. The fizz rate is decent at 9 hours (Coke goes flat in 11 hours, and Pepsi peters out in 8 hours), and a belch with a mouthful won't burn your nostrils. Not as difficult to locate as you'd imagine (what with the cuttthroat marketing of the Big Two). As long as they keep makin' it, I'll keep reaching for it.
