I dearly love New Zealand and would like to move there (Whangarai, Wellington, or Christ Church but not Auckland). Getting around Auckland is the worst. The taxis are expensive and public transport is slow and difficult. I was staying at a hotel near the airport with my daughter and getting from there to the aquarium and back was all all-day effort. Maybe if I knew the city better would have helped but when I mention this to a Kiwi, they all seem to knowingly nod. My advise is: Pay the extra money to stay at a hotel that is convenient to downtown (they have a free loop bus there).
