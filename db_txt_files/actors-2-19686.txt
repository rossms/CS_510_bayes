Reiser is about as funny as a rusty nail through the foot. He was incredibly lucky to get paired with the luminous Helen Hunt and ride that Mad About You gravy train for so many years. But I'd be interested in seeing him in some dramatic roles, as he really turned out a winner performance as the slimy Burke in Aliens.
