Sweet Tarts aren't even OK anymore. They are so annoying and hard to digest that it's not funny. Spree Candies are put into a hard shell that cracks once it is disolved in your mouth. Sweet Tarts are dipped into a sour powder with 30 different acids in it, that doesn't dissolve in your mouth, and lays in your stomach causing you to get constipated.
