I've been to Denver, Boulder and Colorado Springs. The mountains in Colorado are breathtaking. Take a drive from Denver to Aspen and you'll feel pretty insignificant next to these towering beauties. I'd also recommend a scenic trip South (New Mexico is about 5 hours drive from Denver). You drive from this lush, green land through to this arid, dry, no vegetation in site, place. However, lacking in life the road around you is, the mountains are always an awesome presence to your right as you drive South, keeping you straight.
