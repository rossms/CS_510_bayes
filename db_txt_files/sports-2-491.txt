Now that he is out of Philly, I can let this punk have it. While he is clearly a talented, at times overpowering, pitcher - I have to say that he did nothing for the Philadelphia athletics. All he ever did was bitch, bitch, bitch - that he wants to play for a contender, that they should trade so and so, that they should not trade so and so... blah, blah, blah... and how about when he used to put a towel over his head when Mitch Williams was trying to close games? What a distraction this guy was... plus he always seemed to get hurt when the phils needed him most. Good riddance to this punk.
