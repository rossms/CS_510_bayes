I remember when MJ came into the league I thought that he was something of a cocky upstart who had flash and athletic ability, but I really never envisioned him becoming the best ever. Hands-down he is, undeniably, the best ever. His confidence, when the game was on the line, is unequaled perhaps by any athlete in any sport, and his all-around skills were awesome offensively and defensively. He was a true juggernaut. There are a few players today that seem to have potential to come close, but in the end it will probably be 'no cigar.'
