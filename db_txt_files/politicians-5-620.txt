One of the truly great leaders of the 20th century and a great role model for female leaders: she taught that principles matter, not phoney interest group politics. Isn't it funny that conservative/liberatarian women who demonstrate strenght and confidence are reviled by feminist groups, but unaccomplished victims like Hillary are celebrated. Oh yeah, but then feminists also trash female victims who have been preyed upon by Bill Clinton and his gang (Paula Jones, Juanita Broaderick, KAthleen Willey). I guess their hypocrisy is only one dimensional.
