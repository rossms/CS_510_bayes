Best Handheld game system in my experience. The games that I have played for is are intuitive and easy to learn. I have been addicted to MLB and have played it non-stop since I got the PSP. I have enjoyed the PSP's versatility and battery life. The idea of having adjustable screen brightness and sleep mode were well thought out and add to the overall impressive experience.
