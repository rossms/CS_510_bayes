Overall, very entertaining although some say undemanding. Undemanding's good enough for me though. The best bits are those with Smith and James, especially James demonstration of his dancing skills. On the downside, the romance between Smith and Mendes is unconvincing and the Mendes character is too unappealing, a spiky bint with a bad temper, bad attitude and no ethics. She's quite happy to screw other people just to get her story. Frankly a high maintenance girlfriend from hell.
