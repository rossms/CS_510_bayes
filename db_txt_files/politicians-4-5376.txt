Al Gore is definately the stronger candidate...it would be nice if people let their perceptions of his personality go...he is a very intelligent, caring man who I will be proud to vote for in November. His record speaks for itself when it comes to health-care, education, and taxes...as a mom of 5 elementary-aged and younger children, I can tell you that G.W. is a terror we do NOT need in Washington. Go Al, we outnumbered Democrats in the state of Utah will be a loud voice for you and the wonderful things that you have done and will continue to do as President of the United States!!
