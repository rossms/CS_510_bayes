The finest real rock and roll recording released in a decade bereft of quality music. Kicks ass on a number of levels. 'Seeds' was meant to be listened to from beginning to end...there's no real weak spot on the entire disc. Brother Cane never got the recognition they deserved. This recording belongs in the collection of anyone who claims to love rock and roll.
