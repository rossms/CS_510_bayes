Class act, both on and off the court. Although I am an avid Lakers fan, I was secretly rooting for the Blazers in the western conference series and Steve Smith had a lot to do with that. His solid presence on the court and ability to convert easy looks into baskets makes for great basketball. I hope to see Smith playing a larger role in the Blazers offense next year.
