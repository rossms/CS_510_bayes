The greatest guard ever, arguably the best ever. No question the best of his generation, the preceeding generation, and I don't see anyone getting close yet. Kobe's gonna have Larry Holmes syndrome, then there's the uncertainty of the future. Besides Wilt, I can't see anyone coming close. Best player ever under seven feet tall. How 'bout that. Makes up in career steels and assists for Wilt's boards. Can't compare them. Best big man Wilt best Gaurd/Forward Mike. Head to Head in their primes: Mike of COURSE!
