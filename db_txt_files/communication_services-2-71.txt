Well let me say that I worked for ATT (also called Ma Bell) in the old days and it was a good place to work. That was back when we only had one phone co., and maybe we paid higher rates but look at the serivice you got. I can remember the telephone repair person fixing the phone for my parents. Nowdays they tell you they don't fix phones and they want to charge extra to fix the inside telephone wire if your not paying extra for the inside wire plan.
