This CD rocks! Limp Bizkit is one of the few bands from the rock/rap genre that I actually like. Hits like Nookie and Rearranged are songs you can really rock out to. Another thing that makes this album good is the fact that they have other musicians like Scott Weiland, Jonathan Davis and Method Man contribute to the album.
