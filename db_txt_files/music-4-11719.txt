Good Charlotte are one of many punk-inspired boy bands that are great for entertainment. In an age where the pop boy band is on its way out this is the new wave. Joining the likes of Sum41, Simple Plan, MXPX, Ataris, New Found Glory, etc the music is fun. Some of the bands consider themselves to be punk, others do not. Truth is that punk is an attitude any way and you'd have to get to know them personally to figure out if they are or are not. Even the music is closer to what punk used to be than a lot of the bands that are widely accepted as punk today. GC rocks! Deal with it.
