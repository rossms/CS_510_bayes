It was such a horribly bad movie . . . but, that seems to be what it intended. Horrible acting, horrible storyline and horrible script geared specifically to make you laugh. It's so cheesy and bad you'll laugh so hard that you could probably cry. It's definately not a horror flick. It was kind of neat to see the two fight and see who would win.
