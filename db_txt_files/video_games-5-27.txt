I love this game. It puts you in a time and place where cleverness and stealth are used instead of massive firepower. The scenes are awesome and the characters and AI just work. Not an easy novice game but will keep you playing for weeks. I really wish they'd come out with Theif 3 but alas, probably not to be.
