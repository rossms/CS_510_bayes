Tragic Kingdom is still one my all time favorite albums... minus Don't Speak (didn't like the song when it came out, still don't like it to this day), so in my mind, Return of Saturn had a lot to follow up to. And while ...Saturn is a good album, I don't like it quite as much as ...Kingdom. It's tied with their s/t album, in my eyes. Both very different types of music, but both not No Doubt's best work.
