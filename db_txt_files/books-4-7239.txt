I'm not religious, not even close. I don't believe in the Book of Revelation, not even close to that either. But, the stories are gripping. You know what's going to happen - eventually - or at least I'm pretty sure you do. But, it's the little subplots that keep you going. A few in the series are slow. Unfortunately, you just can't skip them.
