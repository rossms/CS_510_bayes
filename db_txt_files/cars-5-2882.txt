I have a Pontiac Firebird that I dearly love! This car is a 98 model, ram air, all the sleek and stylish features, wonderful gas mileage and tons of great power to boot! This car runs, and looks like it did when it was new. I have known other owners who have put these wonderful rear wheeled cars through the ringer and them come out looking and running great. Great car, but it is sad that they are discontinuing them.
