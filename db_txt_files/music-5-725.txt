Lenny Kravitz is a god among men. Well maybe not that extreme, but the man is talented. 5 is a series of songs that tell his stories from his mother's death to songs for his daughter. His soul is expressed through his music. This CD is a definite must for all. Not only is it a fabulous CD, it's an experience to learn from.
