I wasn't going into this film expecting much, but I, Robot was a lot better than I expected it to be. Despite the premise, the film still managed to remain at least remotely believable. Smith is charismatic and entertaining as always, and the supporting cast does the movie a great service as well. Overall, while certainly nothing spectacular, I, Robot is a decent sci-fi/action flick that I recommend, especially if you're a fan of Will Smith.
