Bad Movie. This is another in a string of Kevin Costner's bad movies. It's redeeming quality is that this is the best I've seen Costner in years. I don't find the movie bad because of the graphic violence as so many others have although I do find it somewhat misplaced. Kevin Costner is just too mean to make the movie entertaining enough to laugh at, and the plot is entirely predictable. Even John Lovitz who can usually be relied on to lighten the mood of a movie doesn't lend a good deal.
