While I don't necessarily agree with his political leanings, his passion for baseball translates to good books. Men at Work takes the reader inside the minds of a manager (Tony LaRussa), a hitter (Tony Gwynn), a fielder (Cal Ripkin), and a pitcher (Orel Hershiser). It is definitely for the true baseball fan. For another book which is less of a time investment, take a look at Bunts which is a collection of all of his baseball-related columns through the years.
