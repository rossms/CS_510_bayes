The quality of the food at Applebee's is actually quite good. The atmosphere and the service by the waiters is also good. If you need to eat something for dinner, but don't want to cook, yet want something better then a microwaved burger at McDonalds, try Applebee's. But in can get crowded, so try not to get there after six or seven at night, or you could end up waiting for three hours to get a table and then two to get your food.
