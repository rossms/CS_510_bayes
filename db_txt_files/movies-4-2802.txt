I luv this movie and you will like it too (if you don't mind adult jokes, body parts not attached to the body, drug content, and violence) The movie was boring when I bough the d.v.d becuz of the split screen but in the theaters the screens huge and since theres a lot of guning and bombs it makes the action 3 times more better. There are some really funny jokes but not many. Lots of action though. I think it's halarious when Martin Lawrence acidently drugs himself and the part when they were in the electronics store and they forgot the camara was still on. Hehe.. I hope I helped ^_-
