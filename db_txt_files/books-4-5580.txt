I've started to read this book twice. The first time I got stuck twenty pages in and put it down. Many months later, I had a friend compare the book to Memoirs of a Geisha, which I loved, so I decided to give it a second chance. And I did read the whole book and I did like it. And while I wouldn't say its as captivating as Memoirs, it is very well done.
