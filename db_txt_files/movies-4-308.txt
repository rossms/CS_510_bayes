This one has been sitting on my DVD shelf for about two years, and I'm only now just getting to it. I have to really be in the mood to watch a so-called epic like this. The acting was very good for the most part, but Joaquin Phoenix (Commodus) really started getting on my nerves with all his crybaby whining. As a couple of other raters have mentioned, the historical facts were pretty much thrown out the window, and that can be pretty distracting when you know it really didn't happen that way.
