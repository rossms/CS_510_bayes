Any body who rates Larry Bird less than a five doesn't understand what a true champion he was. Before closing out his career as a member of the 1992 Dream Team, he was a three time MVP and a nine time first team All Star. Amassing 69 triple-doubles, he helped not only the Celtics, but the NBA to thrive. He achieved 5,000 career assists and 20,000 career points despite his inability to run fast or jump high, defining his prowess as one of the all-time greats.
