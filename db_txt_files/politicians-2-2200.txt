I don't know anything about this governor, so all I can say what an inconvenience for the state of New Jersey, to have a governor resigning amidst scandal and disgrace. It's also obvious this guy married for political reasons or because he was trying to kid himself he was straight. He would have saved himself some trouble and would have hurt fewer people if he had been openly gay and remained unmarried.
