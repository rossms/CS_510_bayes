It's been a great marraige between a coach, a system, a school and it's unique role in college athletics. DeBerry has been great at Air Force. They compete, play hard, win most of the time, go to a Bowl game and dont embarass themselves. This isnt the sort of place where you expect to contend for National Championships or even play toe-to-toe with the Elite schools. Air Force will be an upper division Mountain West school that will contend for a Title , beat up on Army and Navy and test itself vs a quality opponent in a Bowl. It's a situation that has worked well for them.
