This is a spitball team in the worst division in football, including college. They are 5-3 because Ray Lewis is having a good year. Kyle Boller is not the future of any team, and these guys could finish 8-8 and win the division by 3 games because everyone else is so bad. The freaking BENGALS are the number two (we all know what number two also stands for ha ha HAAAAA) team in this division.
