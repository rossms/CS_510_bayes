Harry Potter was a great movie. the casting was good, and it was good how they stuck to the book. Harry Potter is a 11 year old boy who spent all his years living with his mean Aunt,Uncle,And cousin. things change when he recives an invitation to Hogwarts where he meets New Friends and enimies and becomes a wizard. good film. the only problems are the film was too long and there are a few dark and scary scenes. but it was still a great family movie.
