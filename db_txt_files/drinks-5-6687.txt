Gatorade is the cure of all ails. It is the best thing to drink when you have a hang over. Or if you are dehydrated. Or if you are sick. It totally helps calm an upset stomach. It is not too sweet but just sweet enough. There are some flavors that aren't really that good. I don't like the Fierce that much but I am a big fan of Ice. You can always stick to the basics like orange too which is a good stand by.
