Bill Paxton and Helen Hunt do their usual nice acting. A pretty good movie. Nothing really all that new. Just chasin' tornadoes and beating the other team to accomplish their goal. same old, same old. Nice to see at the movie theater and then again at home. Then don't watch it again for ten years. It's just not a masterpiece.
