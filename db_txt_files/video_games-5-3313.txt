I really wasn't into RPG's, before i played FF7, in fact i hated them. After going through the game a couple of times, i absolutely loved it. I played a lot of video games and i truly believe, that this is the best game ever for any gaming system. I rate it a 10 if i could. What's not to like about it!!!
