Have not experimented with too many brands yet. The last 4 brands I have compared are Skyy, Kettle One, Grey Goose, and Svedka. By far Kettle One takes the top, but Svedka is definitely a close 2nd factoring in the price difference. Grey Goose is way over priced and not that enjoyable and Skyy is just aweful in my opinion.
