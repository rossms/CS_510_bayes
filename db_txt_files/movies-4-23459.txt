I liked this movie a lot. Im scared as hel of aliens. But after you think about it- it was real y un realistic - ok heres the first few things- A) water is the most abundant resource on our planet- what if it was a foggy day?.. B) They can jump 10 ft. on to a roof, but knocking down a pantry door is out of the question. C) what was the deal with the bok the kid had- with the pics of their house and teh bodies? honestlky- what parent would say- oh, looks like our house.. huh?.. GOD
