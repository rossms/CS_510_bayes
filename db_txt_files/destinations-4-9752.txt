I love the camel turkish series. They have the special turkish aftertaste that leaves a nice satisfying taste in your mouth. The only thing i could argue about in these cigarettes is that they seem to be very light. Turkish Royals seem to have the same taste as the turkish golds, but they are a little heavier. I think turkish silvers are ultra light, turkish golds are lights, and turkish royals are full flavor. if your a light smoker, these are the cigarettes for you.
