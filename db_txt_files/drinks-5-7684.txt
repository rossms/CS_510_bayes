I get this from time to time when I go out drinking, I get it on the rocks with Coke, Maker's Mark is very good and smooth, I like. To me it taste kinda like Jack Danials when it is mixed with Coke also, it taste a little better than Jack Danials and a little smoother and it's about the same price as Jack, I like them both though, depends on my mood or what's on sale. I would recommend Maker's Mark to anyone who likes good whiskey.
