I have to say that I'm sure that Exorcist was a really scary movie in its time but when I watched it (in this modern day!) I really didnt see what all the fuss was about. I really didnt find it scary -funny if anything. The funniest part was when the girls head turned round 360 degrees haha but to be honest, it really wasnt scary. sorry
