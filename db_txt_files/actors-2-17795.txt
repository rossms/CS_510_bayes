In my opinion and those who remember well, Brenda Dickson brought a vixen quality to Jill that oozed sexuality. Jess Walton is a good actress but I don't think she was ever right for this role and never will. I just wish the producers had left Brenda alone and let her do her work. When it comes to the debate over who was right, I think that I tend to believe Brenda over the producers.
