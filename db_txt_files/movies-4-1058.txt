I really enjoyed this movie. It was interesting from beginning to end and it totally kept my attention. It was perfectly wierd in all the right places, and I LOVED the accents. I always knew North Dakota and Minnesota were full of interesting people, it is about time Hollywood let the whole world know it as well. A good movie worth watching...I highly recommend it...
