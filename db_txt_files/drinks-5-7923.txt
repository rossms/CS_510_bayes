Old Grand Dad 100 is the best of the commonly available, non-small batch bourbons. It has an initial bite that snaps the tongue to attention and then dissolves into a fruity mix of flavors that pleases each area of the palate differently. The mouth feel is rich, without cloying, the color is pure. Wild Turkey self-destructs, Jack Daniels isn't even close, Maker's Mark is great but doesn't have the staying power, Knob Creek never gives up its initial bluster and Jim Beam is ashamed to show his face in front of OG.
