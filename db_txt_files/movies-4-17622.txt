I liked this movie it was cute it is about a guy named Scott who has been dancing for years and he has to dance in this competition ut he has to do ballroom dancing and he has his own way od dancing that the strict rules forbid. But his partner quits because he won't do the ballroom dancing and Fran says she will dance his way so the develop a friendship . But his mother pairs him up with somebody because all she wants is for him to win but all Scott wants to do is dance with fran his way. I love the ending of this movie it is really good you will find yourself rooting for scott and fran in the end.
