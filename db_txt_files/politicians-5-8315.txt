I think I speak for most of America when I say that Ronald Reagan was the greatest leader to ever step foot in this country. He was a courageous and powerful man, but yet he didn't boast about it or use it against anyone. Instead, he used his wisdom to help this country out of the turmoil and troubles left from the 1970's. He is a great role model for everyone and he is greatly missed.
