I used Let's Go Europe in 1990 and found it to be extremely accurate and informative. Since then I use a Let's Go guide every time I go abroad even though I can afford more luxurious accomodations these days. It is a must read before travelling as it really helps decisions about where to go with a limited amount of time.
