J.J.'s hot. He's a 3-point bomber, and a free throw champ. He has gotten better at taking it to the hoop this year, but his ball handling in my opinion still needs improvement. He would be a GREAT asset to the U.S. team. Anywho, Rashaad McCants is the best player in the country, that's no lie. UNC will destroy duke by 20 or more. They would destroy Illinois at that matter..they should be number 1 in the country. OOOOK. that is all.
