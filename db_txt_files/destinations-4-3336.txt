A lively, fun and friendly place to visit. When I was there, I didn't get too far from the French Quarter, so I know there's more out there to see and do the next time. But even in just this part of town, there's barrels of fun to be had. And you don't have to wait for Mardi Gras to have a good time there. They know how to whoop it up all year long.
