Would have been proud to see a McCain - Bradley election. Ralph Nader wouldn't have needed to run. McCain had the courage to speak out in favor of campaign finance reform, just like Nader. I'm voting Nader because I'm tired of spineless rich white men getting a free ticket to the Oval Office. It's really rediculous.
