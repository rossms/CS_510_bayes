When it comes to fast food, I generally prefer chicken, and Popeye's doesn't disappoint. The chain is similar to BoJangles, the chicken comes in either mild or spicy, and of course I go for the latter. What sets Popeye's apart from the rest is their side order of red beans and rice and their biscuits, though the fries are sub-par. The condiments stand offers a selection of hot sauces for an even stronger punch. Some of the comments compare Popeye's with KFC. They are both good, and have different styles of chicken that satisfy different cravings.
