It was absolutely great. You could see all around Chicago, and even though it was foggy the day I went, I could still see Wisconsin and Indiana, which means that the building must be pretty darn high if you can see it through some fog. Also, the lines werent a problem with me, but I was a part of a group, so that may have made it better for me to avoid lines.
