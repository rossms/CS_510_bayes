I really enjoyed this book. Imagine Watership Down meets Animal Farm. Except no killer rabbits and no political analogies. Does that help? Its basically a story of good vs. evil with a lot of Book of Revelation influence. The personification of farm animals just fascinates the hell out of me (no pun intended). A really great book.
