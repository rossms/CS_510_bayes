This game was an impulse buy and the only regret I have is letting it take up so much of my time. This is by far the most addictive game. Ever. You can f^ck around all day and never even touch the real objectives of this game - it's just that big. And it was refreshing to finally see a game that pulled no punches the way GTA 3 did. Video game violence has been around for a while, but this one finally dispelled the myth that video games are only for children.
