This world's second largest building after the US Pentagon reminds Romanians of the communist years. Only Romanian materials and products were used local marble, cherry and walnut paneling, crystal chandeliers, specially commissioned hand-woven tapestries, carpets and draperies to build what supposed to be the headquarters of Romania's last communist leader. Now renamed the Palace of Parliament, this magnificent building of 1,000 rooms reflects the work of the country's best architects and artisans. It is worth visiting.
