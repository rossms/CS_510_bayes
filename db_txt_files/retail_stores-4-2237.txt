I just moved here to the East Coast a month ago, and we have a Publix in our neighborhood. I was told it was expensive but I think it is pretty reasonable. I think it has a good selection and the store seems well-organized. And my dad likes to shop there on Wednesdays, so he can take advantage of the 5% off Senior Discount.
