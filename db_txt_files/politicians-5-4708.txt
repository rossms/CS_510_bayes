I just watched Vice-Presidents Cheney's speech at the first Inaugural ball.I loved the relaxed delivery and his comments on meeting and courting Mrs. Cheney. How lucky we are to have him and Mrs.Cheney as well as Presient and Mrs. Bush! We are all praying for all of you!! Mary Ann Claxton 112 Steeplechaase Lane Nashville, TN 37221 mclax45059@aol.com
