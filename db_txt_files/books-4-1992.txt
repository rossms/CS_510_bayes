There was a time where I was a fanatic of Garfield. I read all the big book collections, watched the cartoon show as a kid, etc. However, the recent Garfield comics (the past 2 years) have been really stail. They're just not funny anymore. Each strip is like reading a punchline that only has a silent reaction (that or the reaction of That's wasn't funny. ). It appears that after 30 years, a long time mind you, Jim Davis needs to put down the pencil. At least he made it good for 20 years. For that, I applaud him.
