REG Coffee from Stars...I think you either have to be in a mood for Starbucks or develop a taste for it.. The regular coffee can be a liitle to strong and bitter for everyday but is good when you when you are seeking a stronger flavor...If you are not a regular coffee drinker you make like the more desert kind of drinks like Mocha Frap...
