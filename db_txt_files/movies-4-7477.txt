Though I'm old school with my comedies, this recent one was pretty funny. Joe Pesci was hilarious as the Brooklyn shyster who struggled with enunciating words like Youths (came out as Utes). Marisa Tomei was pretty funny and even won an Oscar (though Urban Legend says that Jack Palance called her name out as a joke). The late Fred Gwynn (Herman Munster) was also great. For those who don't know, Gwynn was a very versatile actor, and an accomplished artist.
