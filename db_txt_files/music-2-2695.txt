Why is this album rated so highly? Tracks like 'When Im 64' , 'Fixing a hole' & 'With a little help from my friends' are like twee kiddies songs. 'Day in the life' just drags..on and on and on... The production is sloppy and ramshackle making it sound very dated. It seems to me people buy this because somehow they think their collections are incomplete without it due to its 'legendary' reputation.
