This guy has done dreadful for a team with great young talent. Roy Oswalt has been overpushed by this sack of lard, and Morgan Ensberg, despite the hot bat, has been sitting on the bench because this prick likes proven veterans who hit .255... if he's not canned in 3 years, I will align full-fledged to the Cubs. FIRE JIMY WILLIAMS!
