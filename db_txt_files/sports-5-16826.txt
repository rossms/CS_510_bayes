If you hate the Packers then you don't understand. I understand that there are only two real football teams: The Green Bay Packers and the Chicago Bears. If you hate the Packers then it's simply jealousy or you're Bear fan. I respect the fact that a Bear fan hates the Packers,just as I hate the Bears, but I respect them and their fans. Hate Packers if you like, but unless you're a Bears fan, you only wish you grew up rooting for the greatest team in sports history: THE GREEN BAY PACKERS.
