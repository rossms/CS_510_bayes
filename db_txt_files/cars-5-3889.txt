I bought this vehicle used at a decent price. Better than a new car that doesnt have it capabilities. I drove thru snow piled high and never even slipped. It is fantastic. Low maintainence is a plus. Everything on it functions perfectly. I have long 400 ft. driveway that when loaded with high snow is no problem for me to get out. Thank you Ford and whoever traded it in after lease. No more slipping or sliding in winter with the awd on it.
