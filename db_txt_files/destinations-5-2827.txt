I recently visited Philly from out of town and had the best pretzels on earth. We were at the Auntie Anne's shop on South Street across from Jims Steaks. In the same store we tasted something called Irish Ice. It was the best water ice that I ever tasted. The product was creamy and smooth. Mango was the best flavor. The staff was very friendly and helpful. We loved Philly and will visit again soon!
