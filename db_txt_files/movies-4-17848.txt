A very good movie. Terrifying. The hedge scenes are a little overdone and drawn out. The film quality, being 20 years old, could be better by today's standards- A remake or a NEW version would be fun... ..... (perhaps, John Travolta in the lead- Here's Johnny .... Mr. Cotter. - nevermind, please disregard this last comment.)
