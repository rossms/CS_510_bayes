Best Buy is definately the best place to go for stereo equipment, computer equipment, DVD players, VCRS, televisions, game consules, video games, videos and DVDs. There's always someone available to help me find whatever I may be looking for (espescially in the huge movie section of the store). The prices are more reasonable than most places, and the selection is awesome. It's a great place to do your Christmas shopping.
