For someone who only smokes lights I loves these. The flavor is magnificent and the after taste is smooth and full. Every time I hae these cigarettes on hand someone wants to bum one off of me. The only down side is that they aren't redily available near me. I have to travel half an hour to Meijer to buy them and so I get them by the carton. It's a great deal at less then $4 a pack. I would recomend these to anyone who smokes lights.
