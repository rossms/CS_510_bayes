He's waited for 3 years behind Durant for this chance and he's finally getting it. He has the ability to make the good decisions and he's definately got the talent and skill. Unfortunately, the rest of the offensive line isn't giving him much of a chance to show what he can really do. I think if they can start to gel and communicate, Matt Baker would be much more effective.
