The pistons got by the Lakers because there wasnt a healthy guy left on the team. Had everyone for L.A. been healthy, the series wouldve been 4-0 Lakers. The Lakers are still defending Western Conference champions, and i highly doubt the Pistons will be able to repeat when going against the likes of San Antonio or Minnesota.
