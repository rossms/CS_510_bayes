Worth reading, despite the fact that Doyle frequently cheats. Most interesting in that many of these mysteries are not violent at all, and in several cases are not even crimes. This is an interesting counterpoint to more recent crime fiction. Strong stories: Scandal in bohemia, Copper Beeches, Veiled lodger. Weak: Valley of Fear, Silver Blaze (Doyle doesn't know anything about horse racing)
