I just bought a 2001 GL2 6 cyclinder and thought the gas milage would be better. I now have 6,000 miles on it and the gas milage has not improved. I love the way it drives, the way it looks and am especially impressed with the brake system. I would recommend this car if you don't mind getting 24 mpg or less on the highway.
