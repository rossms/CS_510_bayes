One of the best mob movies ever made. Ray Liotta is excellent in this depiction of the rise and fall of a half Italian unmade mobster. Beautifully supported by Robert De Niro and Joe Pesci, this film is worth watching. Funny thing though, I found that I did not actually enjoy the movie until the second time I saw it. Let it grow on you a little.
