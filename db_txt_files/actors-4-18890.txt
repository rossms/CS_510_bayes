Snatch and Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels were terrific fun, but they were essentially the same movie. I fear he may fall into the Shyamalan trap of only being able to do one type of movie based on certain gimmicks. The novelty of these gimmicks will one day wear off and they'll be merely irritating. It's good that he attempted to break away from that pattern with Swept Away, but every other decision surrounding that movie was contemptibly bad. Madonna will never be a good actress and will never, ever deliver anything other than a bad performance.
