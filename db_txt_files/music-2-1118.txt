This Cd is merely a white boy trying to rap, sing country music, go pop and make a few bucks. There are a couple good songs on this CD but not enough to make it a worth while CD to buy. And anyways, the only 2 good songs have been over-played on the radio so if you really want to hear him whine just turn on the radio.
