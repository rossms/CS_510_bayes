It's where my family and friends are and the cost of living is cheap compared to Michigan, so I give it a 4. It doesn't get a 5 because it's a Republican state, Dan Quayle was born there, they have this scary relationship with their Hooiser basketball team, they still defend that jerk Bobby Knight to the death, and the landscape is pretty boring. So damn flat you can see Ohio on a clear day...
