Love Trans Ams, the only thing that i don't like is trying to get in and out of them, but hey, when you buy a muscle car that does 0-60 in 5 flat, you shouldn't expect to get in and out of it like a Lexus, i hate when people judge this car with Lexus criteria, it's a muscle car!!! it was built to do one thing, go fast, sound cool, and get you attention from everyone watching.
