Pet Semetary is a pretty bad horror film, mainly because it never gets anywhere, and there aren't any killer pets in this movie. It's about a surgeon who loses his son when he is hit by a car, and they bury him at an indian burial ground, and he comes back as a slashing murderer. It's extremly bloody and really not what you'd expect from Steven King.
