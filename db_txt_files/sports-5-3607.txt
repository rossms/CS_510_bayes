One of the greatest players of all time and should undoubtedly be in the Hall of Fame. The Hall of Fame is for great players, NOT perfect, moral angels. I'm sure not all the players in the Hall of Fame were the most honorable, noble people, but they're there because they were great players....almost as great as Pete Rose.
