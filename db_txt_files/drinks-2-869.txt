I bought a 6 pack of Heineken for my girlfriend. She enjoyed the brand, but I had never tried it. Heineken has a great image, so I really wanted to like the beer. I didn't. It was skunky, one of the worst beers I've ever had. In fact, if it wasn't for some tainted homebrew I had (fouled by bad yeast) it would have been the worst beer I've ever had. I ended up giving the remaining 11 oz in the bottle to my girlfriend. Bleh!
