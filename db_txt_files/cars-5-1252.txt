I am very pleased with my 2002 Nissan Altima 2.5s. It has had several problems though, but the dealer was very cooperative, and even went to the extent of lending me a car until my car was fixed. Other cars that I considered was Toyota Camry, which was to slow and cornered ponderously, Honda Accord, which was to small. The 175hp, 180lb, engine is very smooth and peppy. Highly recommended.
