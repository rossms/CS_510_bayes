There is SO much more to Athens than just the Acropolis and archeology, and it's worth visiting just to experience the culture of the city. I lived in Athens for a couple of months, and it wasn't until I had been there for about 8 days or so that I really started to fall in love with the city. Night time walks down Ermou Street, lined with musicians... The grandeur of Syntagma Square... I love this city, especially at night. Remember if you go that only tourists eat supper between 5 and 8. Athenians eat around 10 PM. That's when it's really fun to be around, once the tourists have gone to bed.
