 The Hershey bar is boring! It's only chocolate! I don't like it because there's nothing else in it! --I just have one word in response to such reviews--BAH! Since when did people stop liking plain chocolate? It's really great, and Hershey's makes the best (inexpensive) chocolte, except for Dove. With all the fancy stuff, some people enjoy just plain chocolate every now and again. We enjoy simply savoring the wonderful taste of chocolate!
