I've been in up to 6 Janus funds. Overall, the performance has been acceptional. Their customer service is the best. I am concerned about their concentration in tech, only. Since now is a good time to be in DOW, and Medical stocks, Janus is lacking in this diversification. I have asked the Customer service rep about, but they don't reveal their current holdings. If I could switch some of my funds to a sector fund, in DOW or Medical's, I'd be happier. At this time, I'm undecided about my direction. I may pull some of my money out and go elsewhere.
