I came here with a few days left over to blow when I was in England. I'm so glad I went. E'Burgh is a fantastic, unique city. It still has the characteristic soot on its buildings left over from the 1800s. The Royal Mile is a kick. Check out the local pubs, have a Belhaven's and later, head over to the eerie Greyfriars Kirkyard.
