You might not like this if you're expecting beer, since it's not really beer at 17.5% alchohol by volume. It has a unique flavor of port, sherry and cognac with vanilla and maple syrup added in. Very interesting. I like it, but wouldn't recommend drinking more than about 1/2 to one bottle at a time (it's corked, so you can recork it and save it for later if you want.)
