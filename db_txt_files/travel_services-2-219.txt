Maybe financial troubles are chewing employees up. Sometime is going on - because in Denver (home base) UA treated a whole flt of pax to locking up luggage and leaving the bldg. Absolutely the rudest and dumbest trick since the Electras fell out of the sky. I would avoid UA for the next 5 years. And avoid Denver airport - an absolute disaster.
