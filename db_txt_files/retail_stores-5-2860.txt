I AM A CURRENT EMPLOYEE FOR MANY YEARS AND I HAVE TO SAY THAT THERE ARE ALOT OF UNHAPPY PEOPLE OUT THERE.BUT i DO KNOW OF MANY MANY THAT ARE VERY HAPPY. THE COMMENTS THAT I'VE READ ARE ALMOST ALWAYS NEGIATIVE.....I CAN ASSURE THAT WE ARE NOT IN THE BUSINESS TO MAKE PEOPLE UNHAPPY.I WOULD NOT BE A LONG TERM EMPLOYEE OR A SUCCESSFUL ONE IF THAT WRE THE CASE.ITS TRUE YOU CANT MAKE EVERYONE HAPPY BUT WE DO DARN TRY EVERYDAY WHERE i WORK,TRY BEING MORE POSITIVE AND LESS NEGIATIVE AND YOU MAY BE SUPRISED HOW BOTH CAN BENIFIT.....
