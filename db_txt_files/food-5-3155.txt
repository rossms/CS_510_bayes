I just tried Ling-Ling potstickers and I eat them all the time, now. I know that they are sold at all Whole Foods. If there is a Trader Joe's near you they have their own potstickers. They are not as goods as the Ling-Ling's but still delicious. And, they are about half the price and you get more of them.
