Oh my god did you see the street performer with the skateboard doing all those amazing tricks? He was so funny! I loved his show so much I gave him $5. There was also a guy walking on a rope, crazy. Can you imagine if every place had all these street performers? What a wonderful world. Oh and there were also some punk kids too.
