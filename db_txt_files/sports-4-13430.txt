Wow, what a few weeks for Belichik!!! with respect to his coaching ability, he did a good job in Cleveland taking the team to the playoffs in his second to last year. His final season was a no win situation with the announcement of the move to Baltimore. Undoubtedly, he is one of the greatest defensive minds in NFL history. And, he'll be viewed as a hero in New England as the man who defied the second coming of the devil, Bill Parcells.
