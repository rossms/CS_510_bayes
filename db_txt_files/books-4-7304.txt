Let's Go Europe is a great book for the clueless traveler because it points out all hot spots and gives directions to tourist attractions, hostels, restaurants, and anywhere else you might want to go. On the downside, Let's Go says something good about everywhere and so it's hard to discriminate which places are really cool, and which ones are getting good reviews because Let's Go is overly optimistic.
