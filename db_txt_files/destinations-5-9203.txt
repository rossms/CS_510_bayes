OMG, If you go to Barcelona you have to see this. It is the most amazing thing I have ever seen. The arcitect's name is Gaudi and all his work is just breath taking. Sagrada Familia is this huge church that is still being built. It has huge steples that you can walk up and see all of Barcelona. It is just amazing to think that someone dreamed it up.
