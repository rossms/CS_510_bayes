Nestle Crunch Bars are what you might call, The Classic Candy. They are very light and rich in chocolate, but they aren't as bad as the candy that you would find in a Russel Stover Candy Box. They have that crispy filling, kind of like Rice Krispies, but they are a bit more nutty then them. I don't know how Nestle does it but they do still know how to make a good candy bar.
