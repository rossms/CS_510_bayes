Nothing wrong with it, but it's not easy to see how someone could derive something of value from this book, and my requirement of business books is that afterwards, your view is transformed at least slightly and you are left with something to apply on Monday that will improve your business. (I make an exception for Michael Lewis's books here, which are simply too engaging and readable to downgrade for their lack of tools. ) Not really Bad, but not worth the time it requires, either, so two seems justified.
