I've allways liked the Cowboys and I think always will....BUT I'm not one of those cranked up fans that think the Boys are the best and will be in the Superbowl every year! Having said that I think the team is finally getting back on track with Parcell, Keyshawn and Eddie George. But I'm not to sure about a QB in his last years of his carrear. What the boys need is a QUALITY QB.
