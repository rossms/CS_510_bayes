If he can get the ball 20-30 times in a game he can really ware down a team. He got 70-80 of the toughest yards I have ever seen in his game against Baltimore this year. It isn't often you see a second year HB but Ray Lewis on his back, but that's exactly what he did. If that OL can mature and make him holes, and that passing game picks up, he can be Detriot's new, albeit less exciting and talented, Barry Sanders.
