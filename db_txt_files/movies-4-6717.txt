The original version of The Thing is one of the most influential SF movies of all time, inspiring a remake by John Carpenter and providing a plot base for a first-season episode of The X-Files ( Ice ). Sure, the FX are cheesy, and there be plenty of dated male dominance politics and stock characters, but it's worth a viewing.
