A very nice state overall; lots of friendly people. My favorite area are around Gettysburg, Hershey, and Lancaster. The Northeast part of the state, the Poconos, is also really nice as well. The northwestern part of the state around Pittsburgh is also interesting as well. I don't think Philadelphia is the best city in the country, but otherwise a great state, lots of natural beauty.
