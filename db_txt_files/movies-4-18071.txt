Misery is a solid film all around. Kathy Bates' performance is riveting. It's truly a testament to her unique acting ability when you consider that her character went from being normal to evil and then back again several times throughout the movie. Caan is solid as usual. The movie is well-written and well-acted, with a decent flow and an explosive climax. Highly recommended.
