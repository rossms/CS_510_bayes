Papa John's is not the best pizza I've ever had, but it is good. The new Pizza Alfredo and the Six Cheese pizzas are a definite improvement from the pizza before. I find that it lacks in taste somewhat, but nonetheless, the quality of the dough, cheese and pizza are a step above other chains like Domino's. Also, they get the pizza out very fast, which is good.
