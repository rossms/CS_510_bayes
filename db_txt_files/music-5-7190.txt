when very depressed one day I wanted to kill myself so ventured out to the end of the pier, I was wareing my personal sterio at the time and as I climbed up onto the wall to jump, this song started playing and made me realise I had to be strong as EVERYBODY HURTS, so I got down and went to see a doctor. This song saved my LIFE, I hope it does the same for other, fantastic lyrics welldone REM as you saved my life Karen 39 England
