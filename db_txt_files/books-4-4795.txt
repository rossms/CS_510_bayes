This is one of the three books with any real merit this fraud ever wrote. Interesting tale with some compelling themes that are well developed. Intriguing dialogue, inventive use of language, very atmospheric. Ernie's powers as a writer diminish severely starting at this point, with a minor uptick occuring with Death in the Afternoon and a major one with For Whom The Bell Tolls.
