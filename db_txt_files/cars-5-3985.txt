Had an '02 Rendezvous CXL for 2 years and we love it. It has plenty of power for our needs, and the AWD is great in winter. The 3rd row seat is very useful, even for adults, and we wouldn't be without it. Rides and handles like a Buick. Highway gas mileage of about 22-23 mpg at the speed limit. Great buy.
