Emmitt has not been on a productive team in the past few years. With that fact, his game has decreased greatly because of it. However, sending him to a productive team (Minnesota, Kansas City) will not bring up his individual performance (especially if he still insists on being a starting runningback). Maybe if Emmitt exits out now, no one will even remember about his dismal year as a Arizona Cardinal.
