This is a beautiful song with a very artistic video. But I am tired of the controversy caused by the burning crosses and the black jesus. I think they were both appropriate for this particular video since the burning cross can be used to symbolize hate. And I'm sorry but if Jesus was from the middle east he sure as hell would not be white.
