An interesting and well-done movie, though it doesnt do a very good job of showing how truly FUNNY Andy Kaufman could be. For that, find a tape of the Comedy Central special on him from a couple years ago. Still, nice performances and a gripping story about someone whose entire life was devoted to being interesting enough to be the basis of a 2 hour movie!
