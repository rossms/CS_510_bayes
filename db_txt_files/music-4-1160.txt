Great variety with some really good songs-Suzie Blue, Steal My Kisses, In the Lord's Arms. Some songs are terrible though. Harper's music evokes in this new CD but lacks some of the deeper aspects of his older albums. I would rate his three previous CDs as 5's, but Burn to Shine lacks the overall quality of his first three CDs.
