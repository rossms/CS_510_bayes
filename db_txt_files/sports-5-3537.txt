Playing on a team with Mantle, Maris, Ford on the like couldn't have been easy for Yogi but to quote Phil Rizzuto, Holy Cow could that guy play. It irritates me that he is best known by far for his Yogisms (baseball is 90% mental, the other half is physical ect.)and not for his play. He had awesome power, a great average and was versatile. How many games did Mantle catch? I think you have to be sober to do that.
