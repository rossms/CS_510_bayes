Note to VinnyIN. Here's the funny thing about the NBA - teams don't win titles based on their 'ratings' - they win titles based on their performance on the court. With the Lakers gunning for their fourth championship in the last five years, it's misguided - maybe even moronic - to call the Lakers overrated.
