This place is amazing. There's this Japanese Restaurant--I forgot the name, I think it's 7 ?--that's really2 good. You have to find it. Their spicy salmon roll is da bomb!! The Clearwater Beach is great too. The sand is so soft compared to the other beaches I've been in Florida. A nice place to live.
