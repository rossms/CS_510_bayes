I think this is the best city in Florida. I really enjoyed my visit there. The International Drive (or Avenue??) was awesome. I totally recommend this to all you shop-addicts!! :) Amazing golf-courses. When you have nowhere else to go to, you can't be wrong with Disney World and Universal Studio. Fun nightlife too!!
