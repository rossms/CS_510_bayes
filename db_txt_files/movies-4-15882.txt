I'm not really sure why, but there's just something about this movie that I really like. It's just an extremely entertaining, well-done film. Some of it may be just a little too unrealistic, but hey, it's a movie right? It's not really deep or thought-provoking in the slightest, but who cares; as someone on here already said, it was made to entertain and that's exactly what it does.
