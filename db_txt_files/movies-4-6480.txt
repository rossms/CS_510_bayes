Good, sardonic thriller that only Hitchcock could devise! Robert Walker is perfectly sinister as Bruno Antony, and Farley Granger as the object of his bizarre fetishes is also great. The film can boast of an awful lot, as it is one of the most popular of all Hitchcock's films. It's certainly one of my favorites.
