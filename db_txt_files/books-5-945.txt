Though I do agree that the stories are getting kind of formulaic, the writing for these novels is incredible and beautiful. Brian Jacques's stories create a colorful world which can be enjoyed by both children and adults (I'm 22, I started reading this series only a year ago, and I'm hooked). These books hold a special place on my bookshelf!
