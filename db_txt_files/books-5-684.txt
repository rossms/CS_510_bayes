Probably my favourite Harry Potter book. It's long, but it moves smoothly and doesn't drag (unlike OotP). The HP saga really starts to grow up with the thoroughly creepy opening chapter. Here, however, the series stops being suitible for younger children. Some of the imagery is genuinely frightening and could cause nightmares. The book ends with a real bang and sets up even better things for the future.
