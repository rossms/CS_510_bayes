ILOVE this place...it's well worth the drive from Philadelphia. If the power of the Falls doesn't just grab you and pull you in there is something wrong with you. And I love all that tacky stuff on the Canadian side....it's just a fun place to be! Don't waste you time with the US side...go look at the falls and go back to Canada...it's more fun!
