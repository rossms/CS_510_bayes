Steve Smith is having a great year and is one of the top offensive players in 2005. The Panthers won the NFC in 2003, missed the playoffs in 2004 without Smith, and are now back in contention with him. Smith is a game changing type of receiver, who is largely responsible for the success of the Panthers.
