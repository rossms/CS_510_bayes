Taco Bell is sometimes too expensive for the amount of food that you get. The best thing about Taco Bell is the bean burritos for only 75 cents. If you get three that's only $2.25 and that is good if you are short on money and you want a lot of food for a low price. They also have a wide variety of salsa and dressings like sour cream and tomatoes. It's good food if you're bored of burgers and fries all the time.
