Kentucky Basketball sets the standard for all others to look up to, and stive to achieve. The Wildcats have played in a final four every decade from the 40's to the 90's, winning championships in 4 different decades, and will surely make it again before this decade is out. They have the most all time wins, and no team has dominated in a conference like UK has in the SEC. UK is GREAT and stands alone at the top of the College Basketball World.
