I like "So Long Marianne" (though the chorus is annoying) and the oft-covered "Suzanne" is quite a beautiful song. However, I never really got the appeal of most of his songs, which were often pretentious, and his second rate poetry.He can't sing either, and while for some singers that's a plus, it isn't in this case.
