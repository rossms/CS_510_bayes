The most over rated college football coach in football today! Anyone can bring football players to Michigan, but only Mr Carr seems to be able to waste talent so well, He fails to realize defense wins football, and our defense led by my Hermann suck's and thats being nice, and since Carr is the head coach he must be fired, since he won't fire Mr Hermann.
