KG is very versatile. He has the ability to beat anyone in the league one on one, any time of day, except when there's a title on the line!!! Sure, you can make a million shots out in the playground, but that ain't good for nothing. Until he can step up and make the pressure plays in situations where heros arise, he can never be considered great. Nothing personal. I just think a hundred and twenty six million can buy Minnesota more than a choker.
