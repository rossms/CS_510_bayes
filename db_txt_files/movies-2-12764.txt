A Riefenstahl style of propaganda. A steaming pile of narcisistic crud. A dangerous abcess of lies thinly shrouded in truth. A film that can only be taken as truth by those that desperately need it to be true. Even my bleeding heart liberal dad felt it was misleading and shallow. A natural by-product of Dr. Spock's disasterous social experiment. A monument to Michael Moore's huge ego. other than that it was OK.
