Reece's game would be perfect for a team like the Boston Celtics. He would have so much freedom to shoot at will and further develop his passing skills if he wants to become a true point guard. Great size and body for NBA. Should develop into a star if he can knock down his shots consistently and become more of a vocal leader. There are very few guards who are better in this draft.
