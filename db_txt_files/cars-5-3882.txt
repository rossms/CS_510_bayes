I drive the Toyota Scion xB quite a bit as part of my City Carshare program, and I love it. The headroom in this thing is ridiculous. It feels like the car version of a loft, which is much appreciated by someone tall like me. Similarly, there is great visibility from this car - it feels like the whole car is made of glass. Handling wise, the Scion xB was fine, and didn't feel like it would topple over going around turns. I can't vouch to this car's reliability, but as a sporadic driver, I can testify to how enjoyable it is to drive.
