LA WHAT HAPPENED? They've gone to pure sh**. Bryant is good, but is a bigger ball hog than he was before. He can't carry a team on his back in the league. Bet they miss Jackson and O'Neal about now. Now I think the dang Clippers are better than they are! That's as low as it gets there. OMG!!! From Championship contenders to missing the playoffs in a year? Come ON!! UPDATE: PHIL'S BACK!!!!! Thank you Jesus!! Maybe now Kobe can get his head up out of his ass and behave. Phil will help this terrible Laker team improve....but I give 'em a 2 cuz Jackson's back in LA!!
