Although I consider myself a high standards movie watcher, I had to love them for this movie for it brought back so many childhood memories. The movie stayed pretty true to the comic (except Rogue). It had great effects and cool costumes. The only thing the movie lacked was the 45 minutes they cut out of it which supposedly was character development.
