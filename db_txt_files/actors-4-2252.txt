I agree that this actor is very much underrated. I would not give him the full five stars just yet because he hasn't shown a vast range of acting. But he stills has time. Thoroughly enjoyed his dramatic roles in Traffic, Hotel Rwanda, and Crash. And liked the funny roles like in Rush Hour and Ocean's 11. For real fans of his, make sure you have checked out Manic.
