My favorite of all drinks, but very dangerous. In fact, there is a 1969 Super Beetle on the bottom of Dorcheat in Louisiana to testify. You see, they taste so much like a candy liqueur, you will down too many too fast. Then your best friend of 5 years will ask you if Bug's will float (you know, like to old story goes). They don't.
