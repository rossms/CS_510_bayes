I have a Neiman Marcus AND Bergdorff Credit Card and I have to say that these stores are NOT for the average person -which I am. However, I do enjoy looking around through them and ordering something on-line once in a while. If you are a cardholder, you can receive their wish book at Christmas and it will make you faint to see those prices.... Never-the-less, when someone see's that you have a Neiman's Card or view's that on your credit report, they know you mean business!
