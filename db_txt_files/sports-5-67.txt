8/5/04: Pujols has more HR's than K's this season (31 vs. 30, respectively). That's pretty much out of control. Big Al himself is out of control. His worst season in the majors was in '02, when he hit for a .314 avg with 40 doubles and 34 homers. Yes, go back and re-read that. And no, those aren't typos.
