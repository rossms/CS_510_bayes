This is a mall jewelry store and a large corporation. Do not expect to get good service in repair. However, I have received many gifts from Whitehall and they have all been very good quality, never any problems. If you need something repaired, just pay the extra money and take it to a local jeweler. Don't expect hassle-free service from a corporation whose central management is very far away from its stores and sales representatives.
