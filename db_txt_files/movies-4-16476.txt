Romeo and Juliet was a movie created by Baz Luhrman. Although this movie didn't agree with all of Shakespeare's original play--Romeo and Juliet, it did have several good points. One such point was the vows exchanged in the pool. Water is the sign of life and the scene in the pool supported this. I also like how he created their costumes to match who they were in the movie. Such as Juliet, who was really an angel to all, and Paris, a guy that represented what everyone wanted to be.
