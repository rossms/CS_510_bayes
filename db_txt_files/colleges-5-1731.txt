Ohio State has fantastic profs, departments, programs and facilities. It is big, but the campus breaks down by departments so that all the students have their own smaller campus. I will admit that dealing with the administration can be a pain, but the experience teaches good negotiation tactics. Oh and to Anonymous down there, pipe down Blueboy! Michigan fans can be loudmouths.
