Course materials and facilities for learning are very good. You have contact with course writers and leaders and they do listen - courses are updated regularly. Many concepts are also relevant to service industries and smaller organisations which some MBAs miss out. However, tutors do vary in the Business School and the standards need consistency. The OUBS do recognise this and are doing something about it. Overall great people and it has had no end of relevance to my job.
