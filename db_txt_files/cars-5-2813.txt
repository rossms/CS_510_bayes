I don't know what the obsession is in here with chevy and pontiac. These companies have no idea how to make a sports car anymore. Yet Ford has always kept a little of that muscle quality in the Mustang. The new Trans Am and Camaro models are meant to look like a bullet but the Camaro has ended up looking more like a sedan than a prime sports car. The mustang however has kept its bulky muscle look while everyone else has gone streamlined, probably why the Mustang was, is and laways will be the worlds best selling sports car.
