I was not a fan of his musical efforts, but have been very impressed with him as an actor. I really liked Boogie Nights, the cheesy/porno 70's theme was extremely entertaining for some reason. He was believable as the good kid turned porn star and throughout the tumultous lifestyle. I even liked him in Perfect Storm. Geez, who knew?! He is a long way from the Funky Bunch (thank God).
