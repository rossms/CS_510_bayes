The ending was SUCH a dissappointment compared to the original! And the acting and characters were kind of weak. But I had such a good time going to see it anyway! I have mixed feelings. As a movie on it's own, Planet of the Apes 2001 was great, but compared with the original, it appears very mediocre. It's definitely fun though! And I kept on cracking jokes to my sister about that dumb blonde that Marky Mark falls in love (?) with! When he's leaving her to go fight the apes.... I will never forget you, Jessica! I'm sorry if it's not funny now, but it was side-splitting when I first said it! :)
