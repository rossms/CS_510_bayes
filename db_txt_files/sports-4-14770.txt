Hard to say. Played behind one of the best offensive lines in NFL history for many of his great seasons. The fact so many of his blockers were so great does count for something. He still showed great heart by playing hurt and making the yardage when needed. He is close to a 5 but his teams success is not necessarily due to his presence. Those who rate him a 5 have good reason. I just find his linemen to be so dominant that anyone, including myself, could have rushed for big yardage. Assuming I survived those 250-300 pound defensive players tackling me long enough.
