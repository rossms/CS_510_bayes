Korn is one of the best bands I've seen around. I love the songs Freak On A Leash and Reclaim My Place. They write about real issues that happened in their lives and things that are going on even while you're reading this. Their songs can make you cry, laugh, or just want to get up and dance. KoRn is original and deserve some recognition. Also, their cute! (he he ha ha!)
