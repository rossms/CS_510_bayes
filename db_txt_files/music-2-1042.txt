Although I'm not much of a fan of Creed and esp. Alt. Rock, with the exception of 1 or 2 songs I thought that Human Clay wasn't nearly good as Creed's debut: 'My Own Prison.' Human Clay is a lot lighter and more optimistic than their darker debut, but the songs aren't as well developed and most tracks are fillers.
