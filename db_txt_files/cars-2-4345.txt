I have a 2001 Montana (purchased new). I have replaced the brakes and roters, a leaking intake gasket (a known problem with this car), the condenser for the A/C, and have had to have the transmission rebuilt. None of this under warrenty of course. We follow all of the routine maintenance procedures and address problems as soon as they occur. I would never buy another Pontiac!
