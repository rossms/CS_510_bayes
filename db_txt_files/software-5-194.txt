yes, it is not free. but in rest, i think it is the best. firefox had the tabs all right, but in opera they are implemented for years. in terms of usability, u can really configure it in every way you want + that opera has many many new things. i read in the magasines firefox reviews, that it identifies itself as ie or opera or netscape (that is news), but opera had it for years.. eeeh, whatever. nevertheless, firefox is very good
