Too bad that 2k2 or 2k3 were'nt on the rating scale. I own both and I was hooked from day one for both games. The online (vs.) modes are awesome and same goes for the supporting ranking site that can be used to give yourself a world ranking (casesladder.com). Kudo's to the EA team on putting together a great series of games that intrigue golf enthusiast like myself.
