My husband bought my bridal set at Whitehall. They sized the ring incorrectly and the band cracked in half after wearing it for a year and 2 weeks. It is white gold and has turned yellow. They expect me to pay to correct that and the diamond was loose and had to be repaired already. They were very rude to me and I will never shop there again!!!
