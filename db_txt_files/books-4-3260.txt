Vittorio is a vampire who has had a tragic young life. Anne Rice details the era, the wardrobe, the climate and characters exceptionally beautifully. I love the darkness and mysterious nature of the powers about to unfold in Vittorio since he was made into a vampire at such a young age. I did not like that he was attracted to men.
