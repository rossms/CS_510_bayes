Massachutsettes is a great place to go over the holidays, or just any time. They've got some excellent shopping from furniture stores to comic book stores, you'll find what you need here. The food is wonderful. $20.00 turkey sandwiches that could feed a whole family. For the kids there's the museam and the Boston Red Sox Stadium over there.
