Beijing may not rank as high as NYC, Paris, London but it's a great place for a short visit. The tourist traps like Tienamen Sq., the Forbiddin City, and the Summer Palace are also unforgetably beautiful places. But it is a huge complicated city, and even a native who took us to a favorite restaurant got lost because the taxi driver knew two streets with similiar names. Few people speak English, so learning a little Chinese is very helpful.
