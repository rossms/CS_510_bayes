Way too republican and closed minded- harsh climate, and flat. The people have their heads buried in the sand- and are of out touch with the real world- which yes does have those blighted cities in the northeast- and the crime,diversity, weirdness and costs of california. Nebraska is out of touch, dumb and boring. A state that has continually voted republican (except once in the last 60 years-1964) seems stuck In the past and afraid of change- stay clear. One saving grace- it does have the profit and thinker of Warren Buffett.
