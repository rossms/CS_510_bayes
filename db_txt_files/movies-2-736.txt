Swoony piece of crap. Maybe I don't like being force-fed romantice epics via over-obvious soundtracks, acting and direction. Daniel Day Lewis' performance is ridiculous. The one bright spot is the performance of the main villain, which does not stoop to cliches. Sorry, I forget the name of the actor.
