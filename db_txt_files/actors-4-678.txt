Good at comedy. I liked his Pink Panther movies. he was funny as Clouseau, He was good in the Party. One of his best movies was Being There. as the a litte slow gardener who was taken in by a rich man and mistaken for this brilliant man who had these wonderful thoughts and Philosophies. good movie too. Died too young.
