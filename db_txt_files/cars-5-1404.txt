Th millenia is a sleeper. An incredibly luxorious car for the price and lighting fat to boot. Spend the extra 3k to get the S model b/c the Miller Cycle engine is faster and uses less gas (no I'm not kidding, it has to do with the compression ratio). Solidly built this car is in a class of it's own. Every cop who has ever pulled me over has said nice car before flipping out his ticket book. You'll look like your rich, keep up with the kids in the sports cars, be safe like a volvo and do it for under 35K. I have 2, enough said.
