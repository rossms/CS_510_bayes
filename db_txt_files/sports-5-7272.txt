Bill Russell is one of the greatest team players and winners in the history of sports. His defensive play revolutionized the game and his battles with Wilt were legendary. While I would never pretend to understand what he went through in terms of racism, it is unfortunate that he harbored so much bitterness and resentment following his playing days.
