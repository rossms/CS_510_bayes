When my daughter received her play station for Christmas a couple of years ago, we chose to get her one of the Spyro games. That was the first of now three different Spyro games we ve gotten for her. I m not big into guns and car races in the games, so even I enjoy this little purple dragon. And like many things, they have a web site for the latest Spyro games. (I m not sure if I m suppose to give our web sites here, so just go to google and put the name of the game in the search box and search, it will find it for you.) All the Spyro games are great!
