Of course having Holtz in your name doesn't hurt for a football coach, but Skip does come to ECU with some good experience on his resume (UCON and South Carolina). In his first year, he took a team filled with people he didn't have any part in recruiting, and had a good turn around from the previous two years. Losing by only 5 to West Virginia, going 5-6 (up from 3 wins over the previous two years combined), and winning the last two games all say good things about the team's future prospects.
