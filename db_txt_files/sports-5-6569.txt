Does Munson know anything about sports? They are one of two undefeated teams left in the country and have manhandled Seton Hall twice in the last two weeks. Scruggs, Boumtje-Boumtje, and Braswell are all big time players who can play at both ends of the court. Sure, the Hoyas play a cupcake schedule in the early goings, but that doesn't change the fact that this team is actually damn good. Perhaps not a 5, but someone needs to counteract idiots like Munson.
