No matter how close you may be to the airport, or what kind of transportation you take to get to the airport, plan to add at least 1/2 an hour just to get IN to the airport. Traffic is unbelievable and moves at a snails pace. The airport just seems a bit too small and the roads too poorly laid out to handle the sheer masses of people it needs to. Allow for a lot of extra time.
