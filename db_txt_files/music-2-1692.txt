Posibly one of my worst ever purchases. I didn't mind Garbage's older material but i never listened to any albums, and i really liked cherry lips. but then i heard this album, and trust me it's s**t! If you're a big garbage fan u might be able to sit throgh it, but i'm not! I can quite honestly say i'm imbarrased to own it! I think the only course of action is to put it at the bottom of my cd pile and pretend it's not there! Did i say i don't like this album?
