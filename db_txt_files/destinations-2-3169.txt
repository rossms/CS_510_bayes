Toronot sucks! I didn't liek it here at all, I've been twice. The city is really clean, but other than that I didn't think it was that great. The clubs were ok. Everyone says the people are really nice but I didn't think they were any nicer than any other people from any other city. The only good thing was the lower drinking age.
