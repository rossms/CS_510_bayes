I'm not a big fan of video games, although I was when I was younger. Give me Tetris and I'm happy. But my little brother got me TH3 for my birthday this year and I was hooked on it straight away. I'd played the first two versions on the Playstation and liked them, but on the PS2 the graphics were smooth and fast, the gameplay was busy, and the levels were challenging and entertaining. The two-player games are a lot of fun too, although you'd benefit from a big-screen TV to fit the two skaters in properly. Great game!
