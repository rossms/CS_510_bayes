pretty well done movie. with Audrey Hepburn, and Shirley MacClaine. they play teachers who just opened up a girls school. they have been good friends for years. One young girl known for being a troublemaker, starts a vicious lie about the teachers. this gossip causes panic among the parents who quickly pull their girls from the school. a sad movie that shows how awful gossip can destroy careers and lives.toward the end the rotten little girl who started the gossip is found out,but now it is too late.lives have been ruined and it has a sad ending.god acting with the leads. a bit soap operish at times.
