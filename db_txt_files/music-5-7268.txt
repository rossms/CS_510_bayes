Great video, I think only Thriller is better. This was #1 several times on those Top 100 or Top 500 videos of all time countdowns that MTV used to do. Also an awesome song, if you don't like this song you have no taste in music. I know a couple of older people who like almost nothing outside of Classical music, but yet they like this song.
