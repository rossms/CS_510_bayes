Martha and I went to this flick together and she hated it. She had read a Pauline Kael review in the New Yorker, and Pauline did not treat the movie kindly, to say the least. I was more tolerant of blather in those days. For instance I searched for the meaning in "2001, A Space Odyssey." Isn't that sad? I recommend this movie. For one thing Sean Connery wears a diaper, and secondly he uses a Webley-Fosbery self cocking revolver, and that tingles us gun-nuts.
