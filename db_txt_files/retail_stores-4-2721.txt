I enjoy shopping at Lowe's more than Home Depot. These chains are awfully similar, but Lowe's has been the more pleasant shopping experience for me. Both chains have more pricing power and selection than your local hardware store, but the tradeoff is dealing with an employee whose working knowledge may be underdeveloped. Mom & Pop stores nearly always have a tried and true expert handy.
