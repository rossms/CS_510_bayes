Although Clinton's spending to GDP ratio may not have been bad compared Bush Sr or Bush Jr, he wasn't exactly frugal. One of the biggest lies ever told was the so-called budget surplus. There was NO surplus. You can check the history of the national debt yourself. Debt just kept on increasing through-out Clinton's time in office as it has been for most presidents who resided in the white house. The so-called surplus was an accounting trick. The surplus was actually borrowed from the social security trust fund, which should never be used to fund government expenditures.
