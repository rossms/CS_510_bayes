I got rid of a Ford F-150 for this 2000 Siverado and have not regretted it in anyway. Get over 20 mpg on the highway and I have the 5.3 engine. Love the heated leather bucket seats and the sound system. This truck is worlds above the Fords and Dodges. It is extremely comfortable, easy to drive, great power and is priced lower than the Toyota that the experts think is the best truck. If you want a full sized truck - this is the one to consider.
