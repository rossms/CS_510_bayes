Paul Anderson took some terrific chances in this movie, including a weird operatic interlude which was hard for me to process -- poignant, maybe commic, but definitely ballsy. Overall, while I was impressed by the performances and Anderson's technical chops, Magnolia seemed too derivative of i Short Cuts /i , a film it fails to live up to.
