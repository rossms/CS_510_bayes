It's OK. I read the book and when you actually see the movie, the leads are cast well as well as Mammy. Otherwise, the movie feels dated like it was the 30s rendition of the South during the Civil War. Didn't really feel like a period piece. And what was up with Leslie Howard as Ashley??? He dragged the whole movie down. He didn't get the essence of Ashley, so it was all the more confusing as to why Scarlett kept running after this wet rag.
