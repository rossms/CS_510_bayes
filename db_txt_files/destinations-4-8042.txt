I went to the zoo on one Waikiki stay,and really enjoyed it, it is not a real large zoo, but has enough stuff to entertain you for a lazy afternoon. They had a wonderful exhibit of those giant turtles, the ones who weigh 500+ pounds, man, are they huge! :-) Just something else to do when you are sand chaffed from the beach and want to see furry or feathered friends.
