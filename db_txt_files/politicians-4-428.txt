I wish he were our President in America right now instead of Dubya Bush. He's liberal, but at least he seems to be more principled and moral unlike Clinton. And he's handling the UK's own terrorism issues pretty well. But he really should hire more police to tackle his country's rising crime rate and renationalize the British railroads.
