Great store with cheap prices! the one problem is that alot of stuff they get once and then never get back but its still cheap and the quality of there stuff isnt cheap if you havnt noticed the stuff you buy there is the same brand as if you bought it at the mall the same brand so its not lesser quality the stuff is cheaper because they order in masser quanitys and like if you buy some 50 cent gadjet obviously its not gona be that great its not because its form walmart
