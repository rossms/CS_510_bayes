BA - what can I say - flew into Boston Jan 95 - asked at tickey counter at London what the weather was like in Boston - told a light sprinkle of snow - landed in a blizzard that had closed airports up the East Coast , Boston was last one open. never flew BA again. Their service is at best average, staff sadly uninformed!!
