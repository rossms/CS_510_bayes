maybe a 2.5. really he was not all that great of a child actor. He mostly got by on the fact that he was a cute little kid. He was known for his part as Nicholas the youngest child on Eight is Enough. He was not a horrible kid actor but did not have a lot of range to him. Sadly he was one of the kids who did not manage to cross over to adult aged roles.
