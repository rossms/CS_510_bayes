The first time I went to a P.F. Chang's with a group of colleagues ona road trip, I thought that nothing good would come from chain Chinese. Wrong! THis place rocks! The food is excellent, although they sometimes do run out of some of the more popular items on the menu which is a signal that their kitchen management is not always on its toes. Generally, while a little high-end pricewise, they are a very good place to go eat great Chinese food.
