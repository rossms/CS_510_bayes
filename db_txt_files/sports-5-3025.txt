Lou deserves to be in the top three or four. Mays is the only guy that clearly beats him out. Just go look up Gehrig's numbers, and keep in mind that he career was cut short. He was also playing in considerable amounts of pain towards the end. He helped a lot of his fellow Yanks career stats by getting on base ahead of them and by driving them in when he came to the plate. I'm not sure there's ever been a steadier RBI man
