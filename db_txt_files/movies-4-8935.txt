When my boyfriend brought this home, I just rolled my eyes and said, 'why did you choose that?' He had gotten many a recommendation for the movie. I thought it was going to be horrible. It was actually really good. I don't know if it was in my 'I'm in a mood for a stupid, brainless movie' or if the movie was actually entertaining (I suspect it was a combination of the two). Bottom line is that it is not an Oscar award winning movie but as far as the entertainment factor, it is a good one.
