If computers are going to be like that in the future, I'm very excited! The movie wasn't great, but I enjoyed it. The plot makes you think about crime in a different way, and the choices we make. I do not agree with our legal system going in this direction, though. It also made me think a lot about big brother and the advertising industry. I would hate living in a world where I could be tracked like that and my body would be like an internet cookie receiver every time I walked by a billboard or through a door.
