Red and Blue rate a 5 and this one would as well but adding Pikachu to your party was meerly a way to make more money. I did like the chance to get all three starting Pokemon as well but the game inly rehashes the first two. I do give it credit for eliminating some bugs but those bugs made the game more fun.
