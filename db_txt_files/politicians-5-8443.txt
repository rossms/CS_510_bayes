For those to young to have lived it, Reagan gave this country back its pride and dignity. He didn't proclaim Camelot like JFK did, but he brought the same spirit to the country that JFK had managed to instill. I guess some people are still sore that he managed to beat the Evil Empire because they just thought that it couldn't be done (and certainly not by an ex-actor from the B movies, or worse yet, by a Democrat turned Republican!). Reagan, like Truman, called it the way he saw it; he was right. He gave the country what it needed when it needed it most.
