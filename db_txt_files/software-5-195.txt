It loads fast and works great. Plus, it has a really useful zoom feature to print hardcopies any size you want 'em. For example, i like to save paper and cram all the words onto one page... but some of my relatives don't see so well in their golden years, so for them i zoom in to make the text extra big. So one printed page document for me might be 6 pages for Grand-Dad (double-sided, of course).
