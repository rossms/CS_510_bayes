Alliance contimues the Lucas Arts tradition of great flight simulation games based on Star Wars. Greatly enhanced graphics and reliance on 3D cards make the game look fantastic and no details are spared, with subtleties like in cockpit smoke. Includes a storyline which was lacking in its predecessor, X-wing vs. Tie Fighter, but is losing in the multiplayer department, with only a modest level of useful customization.
