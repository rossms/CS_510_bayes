I worked there for the summer.. it is a gorgeous park!! The town of Banff is however a bit too crowded for me, but there is so much to do in the area like hiking, skiing, rafting, caving... Things are a bit more expensive, but it has to be expected as it is a national park and fairly isolated from larger centers. Without a doubt the most beautiful scenery I've ever seen!
