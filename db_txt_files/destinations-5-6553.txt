Texas has a little bit of everything. Big cities, small towns. Open prairies, lush forests. Vast deserts, muggy swamps. Each has a unique character. Austin is a fine college town; D/FW and Houston both have a certain vitality that I like; San Antonio has an interesting history and heritage; and El Paso is like a whole other world. And every small town in between has something neat to offer. I like this state!
