Buck emall is a dumbass. there is no way that a mercury will ever compare with a japanese car. Period. Once he hits around 60k he will relize this. And yes, the Honda is a faster car, 0-60, and 1/4 mile. I work at a honda/GM dealership with the new GTO's and the six speed V6 Accords and would choose the Accord any day over the GTO. Americans just cant make cars anymore. They make em and you break em. After a 1/4 lifetime of a Japanese Car.
