i do truly enjoy this movie. the sets and props were wonderful, and the acting was great. but i thought the characters and their relationships could've been fleshed out more. i couldn't quite decide whether or not i liked this movie until the last scene. most love stories nowadays are just way to cheesey to make me do anything but puke but this one just melted me, shockingly enough.
