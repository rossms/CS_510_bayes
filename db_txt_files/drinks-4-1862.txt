The Beast will forever hold a sacred place in my heart (and damaged liver). I remember going to college and a case of warm Beast was $4.99 - that was only 10 years ago. I loved this stuff amd I am sure that it made me a lot more appealing to the small number of girls that I have kissed in my life. The tall boy pounder cans always come in handy. Unfortunately, my stomach is aging and cannot suffer the effects of the Beast as well as it used to. I miss this beer, but will occassionally partake in a few now and then for old times sake.
