Hey- Check out this great site that is giving away totally FREE iPods!It's a completely legitimate offer, and this company has already given away $4 million in FREE stuff! I know you all think this is just a scam. I did too until a friend of mine got a free iPod of his own. The offers aren't that bad and you can cancel any time. All you have to do is join, complete an online offer, and refer friends to do get one of your own. That's it! Here is my referral link. To help me get my iPod, click this exact link to join, or copy and paste it into a browser: http://www.freeiPods.com/?r=16263913
