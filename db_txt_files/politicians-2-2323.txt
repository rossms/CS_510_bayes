I find Colin Powell to be a disgrace to people of color. Mainly, for the reason that he is in the wrong Political Party. He is surrounded by Whites that care nothing for minorities, and if they do, it is only for political gain. I feel that he is a puppet of these right-wing elk and that he should look at his roots. I think his summation that Nigerians are frauds, is a disgrace to people of his race, who have struggled, and were treated so badly in the past. I being of part Haitian ancestry, really find it hard to support Colin Powell because of the people he surrounds himself with.
