The biggest improvement over cable: If something goes wrong with DISH Network's service, they send somebody out the NEXT WEEKDAY. If you want to add or remove channels; it's usually done while you're STILL ON THE PHONE. Contrast that to cable: Uh, well, maybe we can send a guy out a week from next Thursday or, uh, something. We switched to DISH Network a year and a half ago, and have never regretted it.
