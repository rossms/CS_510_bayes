I have 4 kids and any place that can make them all happy makes my life MUCH better. We ate at the San Diego location at least twice a month. My kids love it and the manager takes great care of us. He's even refilled my non-spill kid cups with milk for me when my hands are full. My kids love the pizza, its thier favorite... my oldest catagorically refuses to eat any other. Over the years and the through 4 kids its been our favorite family pizza joint.
