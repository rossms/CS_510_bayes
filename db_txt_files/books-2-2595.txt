What I know of this comic, I know mainly from my saga-reading mom, who reads this one by accident. She has little use for the prudish hag or the common younger characters, partly because the flow of events lacks the intensity of others in the genre. Somehow, last year's Washington Post survey reported it #6 among their current forty-odd comics. A reader aptly told the editor he thought it must have been rigged.
