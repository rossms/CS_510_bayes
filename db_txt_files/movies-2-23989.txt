The first 1/3 was VERY good, and then the movie just fell off a cliff. (I wish the master copy of the movie would literally do that). It went on too far and too long with the Pinochio plot. Osment did a good job, as did the actress who played his mother. That is where it should have ended. In fact, you thought the movie was going to end several times, but it just kept going. Well, atleast Kubrick is dead and he won't be able to do this to us again.
