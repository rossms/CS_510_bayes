I just graduated from Yale and it was an incredible four years. I have friends who went to Harvard (which plenty of people I know from Yale turned down by the way - including me) and they pretty much all hated it. Thank God I chose how I did. Seriously, all of them just came out of it depressed and upset, whereas I spent four years chilling with friends, enjoying the resources, and all together lovin' it.
