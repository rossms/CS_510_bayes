Billy Crystal is just one funny guy, and when you see him in an action movie that is also a comedy, you know that it's a spoof that you should be able to enjoy. It was OK. There were some really cool scenes in it, and it was interesting to see Billy in an action film, but the other guy was annoying and terribly stupid.
