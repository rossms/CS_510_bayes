While I am a hardcore Republican, I believe FDR to be the one of the finest Presidents in our nation's history. And without a doubt, the finest in the 20th Century. His social programs not only fed millions of people, but more importantly, got them WORKING. And I truly believe that his leadership and wisdom really made a difference when it came to winning WWII. He was one of the saviors of our country, and possibly the free world.
