for the most part i like this woman. i like the roles i've seen her play like the lawyer in the client. but yes the fact that she seems to support anything that's anti-establishment bothers me a little. i mean i don't think she and other hollywood elitists would preach so strongly if the government took their 20-million-dollar paychecks and turned them into 20-thousand dollar paychecks and suddenly they were big nobodys like the rest of us.
