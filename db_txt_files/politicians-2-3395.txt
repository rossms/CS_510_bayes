Just an average president, although he has been caught up in some of the biggest Public Relations situations in recent history. Most notably are the War in Iraq and the Terri Schaivo case. I think Bush gives many people the wrong impressions because of his horrible public speaking skills. I do have to dock him on the fact that he has taken our national debt and just shot it down the toilet, to a point will it will be hard to get a surplus again. Overall, just an OK president caught up in a lot of sticky situations.
