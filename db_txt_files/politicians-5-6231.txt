Janet Reno is a very honest, strong yet compassionate person. She really tries to do the right thing for people and to be as fair as possible. Some of her decisions have caused pain and she is aware of this. You don't have to agree with someone to respect them and that is something narrow minded extrmist will never understand. Janet Reno does understand that.
