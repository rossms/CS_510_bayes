Save for the track A Day in the Life, I don't think this album stands up to its lofty reputation. It was historically important in the establishment of Rock and Roll as an album oriented genre instead of being dominated by pop singles. However, when I listen to it today I find it to be a quaint period piece, and there was far more adventurous psychedelia being made in 1967.
