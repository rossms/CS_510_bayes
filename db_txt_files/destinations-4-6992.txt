I lived there for a year in high school, so I have definitely experienced it thoroughly. London's huge, and unfortunately pretty dirty in spots, but it is one of the best 3 cities in the world. The best places to see, in my opinion, are Buckingham Palace, Regents Park, Big Ben/Parliament, St. Paul's Cathedral, Tate Modern Museum, and the London Eye.
