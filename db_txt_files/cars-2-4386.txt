This car made me very sad, because I really liked the vehicle's features, driveability, and architecture. But we were constantly in the shop, and after the transmission imploded at 24K miles, we dumped it. (My wife was ready to get rid of it on the 10th or so visit, so it a was a cause of stress between us too.) Have the Sienna now, which is not as good a vehicle, but it starts when I expect it to.
