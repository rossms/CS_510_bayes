Kiawah is a fantastic tourist destination. There is 10 miles of uncrowded beach. Kiawah is a gated community, so it is almost completely crime free. In addition to the great beach, there are first class restaurants and shops. The golf courses and tennis courts are some of the best in the world. Best of all, Kiawah is only a 30 minute drive to the most beautiful little city in America, Charleston.
