As a Bostonian and a lifelong Sox fan, I can say that Avalonman is dead wrong about the sox fans being fairweather fans. 86 years of heartbreaking loss after heartbreaking loss and still 87 (and counting) sellout seasons. Speaking of fairweather fans, how about those white sox fans taking off their empty seat disguises for the world series?
