I have been in love with this park since I first visited it as a six year old in the mid 1960's. What makes this park is of course the wildlife and the natural wonders. I can live with the traffic as it still allows you to move about on your own schedule more or less. I visited Yosemite and the shuttle situation gives you a limited ability to see the park.
