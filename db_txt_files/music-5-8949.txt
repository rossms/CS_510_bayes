This video, like it's star, was simply beautiful. Sophie Muller is a very talented director with a bright future. She, with the help of the ever-talented Sade, painted a lovely picture of calm wistfulness accompanied by a true and deep feeling of love. Love expressed artfully with the bright pinks and greens and usage of flowers. It all was so peaceful and serene, and in that note I think it matched the song perfectly. Well done.
