One of the most effective pitchers of all time. When I was a kid and playing high school B-ball I used to dread the super tall lefties. R J is THE Intimidator. I can not imagine a seven foot lefty throwing 100 mph fastballs in my direction without experiencing pants-pissing chills up and down the old spine. It was also pretty cool when he killed that bird. I understand that he didn't find it all that funny that a fastball of his murdered a seagull, but that kind of thing could only have happened to R J. I will definitely be telling my grandkids about this SOB.
