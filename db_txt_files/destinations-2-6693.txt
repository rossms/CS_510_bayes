I don't know what it is with this state but its like driving through a wasteland of endless corn fields and shanty towns. Proud folks with shoulders back, bellys out, baseball caps on, staring at you as you innocently walk to your car and drive off. I always feel better when crossing the Illinois border and adjusting the watch.
