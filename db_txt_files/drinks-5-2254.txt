I drink water more than any other drink and I felt the same way as some of you guys when I started, that all bottled water tastes exactly the same, when in actuality they don't. Evian is one of the best waters on the market, it doesn't taste of chlorine like Marks and Spencers own brand and it doesn't taste too cheap like Volvic or Highland Spring or just plain bland like Poland Spring or foul salt based stuff like Deer Park. You pay more money for Evian and unlike some of the other brands your paying your moneys worth.
