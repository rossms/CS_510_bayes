I don't think Reagan's greatness can be exaggerated. With his economic policies (i.e, tax cuts) he gave us the strongest economy we've ever had. On top of that, he put the Soviet Union out of business bringing hope to not just millions of Americans but millions of people worldwide. Always positive, Reagan made his enemies--both domestic and foreign--look foolish. George H.W. Bush and William Clinton reaped the benefits of Reagan's economic policies. Reagan is probably the fourth best president in U.S. history. Only Washington, Lincoln and perhaps Jefferson deserve more praise as presidents.
