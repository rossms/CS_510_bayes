In a 1996 poll by The San Francisco Chronicle of the year's worst movies, Romeo and Juliet was defined as joyless and dark . But then, what do you expect from a Shakespearean tragedy? I think you really need to be experienced with the almost archaic styles of the three major types of Shakespeare's plays(comedy, tragedy, and history) in order to fully understand it, or even like it. The juxtaposition if the ordinarily circa 1500's play with a modern setting was a clever touch though.
