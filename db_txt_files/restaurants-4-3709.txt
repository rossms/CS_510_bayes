Given that I pretty much like all kinds of pizza, I don't think I'd give any pizza chain less than three stars. So take this rating in that context. I think Domino's thick crust pizza is pretty good - they use enough cheese, it's usually hot when it arrives, and the toppings aren't bad at all. Also, Domino's makes surprisingly good hot wings, and with the right coupons you can spend less than $12 and get enough food for dinner one night and lunch the next day.
