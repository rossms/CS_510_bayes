One of the greatest running backs of ALL TIME. Awesome player, good commentator, fair actor, and a bad judge of women. Found innocent of the crime of murder in a court of law by a jury of his peers. It's interesting...after 100 years of murders, the first Klansman EVER found guilty of murdering a black person in this country came in 1993. Supposedly, all the Klansmen tried before this time were tried in court of law by a jury of their peers. NOT ONE conviction. This country stood by those verdicts. Maybe O.J. should've joined the Klan...
