I just purchased a 2004 red SVT three door with 14,400 miles I found on-line while in Iraq vacationing with the U.S. Army. It is the best handling car I have ever driven. I have owned a Triumph TR4A IRS, three MGB's and a two Escort GT's( 89/95). I am quite a fine driver. With a new set of TOYO Proxes 4's mounted the day after I picked it up from the Ford dealer, I have yet to find this car's limit. It simply is a marvelous machine capable of incredible handling and great comfort as well. A very happy Ford owner. Ford marketing: You should feel shamed, Dummies!
