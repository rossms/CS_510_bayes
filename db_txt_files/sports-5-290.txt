One of the numerous greats in the Hot-Lanta Braves pitching staff, Smoltz has been great for many seasons. Proving his range, he was a closer this year, after being a starter many years before that. He has a good ratio of strike-outs. Even more, he isn't that bad a batter and has been known to hit a home run or two!
