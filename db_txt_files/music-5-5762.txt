A high achievement for this young band and for the heavy metal genre during the New Wave of British Heavy Metal. The guitar harmonies and melodies are classic Iron Maiden. Standout songs are Hallowed Be Thy Name, Run to the Hills, Number of the Beast, and 22, Acacia Avenue. Contrary to most people's assumption, Number of the Beast does not promote Satanism, but rather was inspired by a frightful dream about a horror movie.
