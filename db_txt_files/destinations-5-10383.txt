Best menthol out there, the tobacco is a little different in different smokes, you can tell by how it feels on your throat Besides that they have the smoothest and perfect amount of minty flavour, just enough to lick your lips afterwards and taste it I prefer the shorts to the longs, the both have the same amount of nicotine anyways
