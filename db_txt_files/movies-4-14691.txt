good movie with Julia Roberts. based on the true story of Erin Brockovich an assistant to an attorney who helped win a multi million dollar law suit against an electric company. that had been poisoning a whole town with the water. Very intersting movie. Kind of nice to see someone who was an underdog become a success.
