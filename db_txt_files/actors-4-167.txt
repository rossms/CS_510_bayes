I always liked this guy, elegant actor and fun/ interesting to listen to him speak about anything. Very amusing in "Spartacus," and in the ok animated version of Robin Hood, playing the cowardly King John as a lion. I love it when he wants to set a trap for the badger (Friar Tuck) calling him "the corpulent cleric."
