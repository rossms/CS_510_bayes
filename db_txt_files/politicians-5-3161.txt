Clinton/Gore -8 years GREAT economy, no threats to environment or with other countries. NOW Bush jr- like the 12 years of reagan/bush sr. bad economy, social security in danger, stocks down, threats to other countries, to environment, lay-offs, hate crimes, the majority of the populations wishes are being ignored. God Bless You Mr. Clinton.
