My closet is mostly Express. I got hooked when I worked there, and have enjoyed shopping there ever since. Some seasons are better than others; honestly I don't find something every single time I go in. I LOVE that they send coupons to me and have promotions that actually let you save on things (just as long as you don't go overboard). I don't have trouble finding my size (1/2-3/4). Best of all, there are a lot of things that are affordable and do not require dry cleaning!
