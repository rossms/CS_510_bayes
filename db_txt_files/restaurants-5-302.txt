I once watched an woman throw up in the In Out parking lot, then go into the restaurant and throw down a double-double with cheese and onions, fries and a chocolate shake. If that is not a testament to the amazing food at in out, I don't know what is. Its a surprisingly good place to take a date if you don't mind watching grease run down each others chin, not a first date, mind you.
