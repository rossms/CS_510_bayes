I have recently been exploring wine, so I am not an expert but I do know what I like. After sampling the Mokelumne Oaks Vintners' blend of cabernet and shiraz, I found it to be full bodied with spice and pepper qualities, most unusal. I did buy a case and would recommend the red wines that I have sampled to everyone.
