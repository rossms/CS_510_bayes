If you appreciate horror movies that rely on suspense and subtlty rather than blood and gore, you'll probably enjoy The Others. Nicole Kidman is amazing as the high strung mother dealing with her children's bizarre condition and all the other freaky things going on in her huge, creepy house. The movie keeps you on edge almost throughout, and the acting throughout is outstanding. I had to take away a star for the obligatory topsy turvy ending, but this is definitely a flick worth watching.
