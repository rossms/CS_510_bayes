I love the Cherry Poppin' Daddies for two reasons: Number one, because they are from Eugene, Oregon which is the city of my birth and where I live now, and number two, because I love big band music. Although Zoot Suit Riot is their only hit thus far, it was an original song and a real break from the fad music of the late 90s. Werid Al's spoof was hysterical, and the CPD WILL be back :)
