Let me start off by saying that Julee Rosso and Sheila Lukins are both amazing cooks (and writers). And when the Silver Palate was published, it revolutionalized American cookbooks. But now, as I go through my dog-eared book, I find that the recipes are a little too rich for my taste. I would recommend some of their more recent titles - Cooking in the USA, The New Basics Cookbook, etc. And if you do buy this cookbook, you won't go wrong - you just may gain a few pounds...
