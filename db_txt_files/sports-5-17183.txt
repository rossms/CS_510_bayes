I rank the Cowboys, as a franchise, as great. I don't know what to expect from this current team configuration but the first game does make the season look promising. However, if I agree with GoRedskins that the Cowboys are only average, that probably means the 'Skins are below Average. Actually, I expect MNF to be a competitive and exciting match.
