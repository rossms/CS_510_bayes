The swimwear is definitely worth a look. I just received the bikini with scoop bottom that I ordered and it is the best fitting swimsuit that I have ever worn!!! Watch out for dishonest sales tactics. One of their sales people convinced me to get a Victoria's secret credit card promising a free item that I was billed for. I was reimbursed and the whole thing was cleared up. So I still highly reccommend the store. One bad apple does not spoil the whole barrel.
