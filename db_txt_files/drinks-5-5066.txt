Unlike it's pathetic excuse of a competitor Coca-Cola, Pepsi is a much sweeter and satisfying soft-drink. In regards to Pepsi being reminscent to that of oily sugar I think that is extrodinarily inaccurate. When your thristy and need something that won't explode because it's so carbonated, you should go for a Pepsi.
