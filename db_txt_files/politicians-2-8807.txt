Great orator, poor example for a president. Did many great things for our economy. However, we were attakced in New York-1993, Oklahoma City-1995, Africa-97 or 98, USS COLE-2000. He did nothing extremem about these things. He seemed to have no respect for those of us in uniform. I am in the military and he did very little for us. I have no use for his policies. He's a nice man and at least he stands for his beliefs in the Democratic party and knows how to win. Kerry nor Kennedy nor Hillary Clinton can achieve was President Clinton did. Hillary won't win the nomination in 2008.
