Whataburger is pretty good. They don't have them in the upper Midwest, so I've just eaten at them when visiting in Texas, where there's one every other corner. The food is pretty good- the fries are your standard fast food taste and the burgers are yummy- they're nice and big, larger than Whoppers, so you definitely get your money's worth. They put a bit too much mustard on the burger, but other than that, it's good! Plus you get pretty good-sized pops. Oh sorry- I meant to say cokes, that's the proper Southern term.
