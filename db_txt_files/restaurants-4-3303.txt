Been with Papa Johns for almost 5 years and I must say they do care about their customers...each store in the area i work in have a customer satisfaction manager who handles all customer problems...no dialing a 800 number or leaving your name and number on a recording...we have been voted best pizza in town for about 3 years stright...the sauce is the best sauce of all the major chains...the veggies are fresh...i know cause i have to cut them up every morning...need to expand our menu...now have chickenstrips so that's a start
