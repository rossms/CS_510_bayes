I had my first experience dining here last weekend and I must say I was not disappointed. I love Chinese food and, having lived in Hawaii, have had the opportunity to sample some pretty good examples of it. P.F. Chang's had a very unique and good tasting selection. On top of that, the service was very good, atmosphere pleasant and the prices were very reasonable.
