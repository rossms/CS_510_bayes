Berkeley was like Renaissance Florence to me. Going there changed my life. Not only were the academics superb, but I got to meet people from all over the world. I got to meet people who were interested in learning for the sake of learning, not just learning a few cynical money-making tricks. This is a great school in a tremendous center of world culture, and well prepares you for being a citizen of the world.
