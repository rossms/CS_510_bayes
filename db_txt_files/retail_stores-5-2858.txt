I love Whitehalls they have been wonderful. I have been a customer of there for many years. My husband and I have bought every piece of Jewelry from there and they have been excellent about saving, customer service and repairing jewelry. Also, they have fixed other jewelry from where other places like Jared's and Reeds have screwed up my jewelry. I really appreciate everything they have done and will be doing in the future. And for all of the complainers make sure you check spell your comments. SOME of you are ignorant.
