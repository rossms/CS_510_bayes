I cannot believe that I am leaving a rating or a comment for a grocery store but... I have to admit that Food Lion is where I shop. They are always nice, helpful and courteous. The produce looks decent ( Whenever the truck has come in ) and the meats are fresh. The prices won't kill you and neither will the store; They aren't bigger than heaven like some stores ( Wal-Mart ). I gave up on the super stores a long time ago; Especially when I finally got thru the line and my eggs had begun to hatch...
