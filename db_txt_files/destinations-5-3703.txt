Denver is my hometown and I love it even though I dont live in the city now. The thing that seperates Denver from other cities is the outdoorsiness of the people and the friendliness of them too. Denver has 400 places to eat in downtown alone, not too mention we have so many good places to eat. You will never find value and quality in eating as you will in Denver. Denver has excellent close-knit neighborhoods with beautiful tree and flower lined streets. The only bad thing is if you visit Denver you will want to go stay so bad that it will stay on your mind !!
