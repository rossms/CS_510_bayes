I understand some may not like the way it looks, but I've gotten nothing but compliments on it. I had a Silverado Z71, that my buddies and I used to take on off road camping trips all the time, and the Avalanche way outdoes my Silverado. The drive is much better, the cargo boxes are awesome and the convertible bed is just what I needed. It also, definitely holds it's own off-road. My brother has an H1 and I haven't seen him do much of anything that I couldn't follow with my Z71 Avalanche. I'm sure there are things, just havne't seen them. Love my Av!
