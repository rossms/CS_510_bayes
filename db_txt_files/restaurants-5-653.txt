Well, when I first had one, I'd never heard about them. We just stopped at the only one I've ever seen in Canada and ordered a dozen. By the time we got home, the dozen were no more. While yes, they are greasy, they also have a very distinctive taste like no other donut I've ever tasted. I do still like Tim Hortons Dutchies better though.
