My comments apply to the 4x4 supercab. It's the most comfortable truck I've ever owned. It's also surprisingly competent off-road. I'm not talking about the Rubicon Trail here, but the construction site, gravel pit, power line, development site I seem to get into more often than I think I will. Acceleration and towing are great, the concomitant weakness is fuel economy I'd like to see improved. (Along with a free lunch).
