This is one of my favorite CD's of alltime. The beautiful thing about this CD is that the songs have excellent lyrics, but it is also a very diverse album. Some of it is hard rock, but there is a beautiful ballad and even elements of jazz. This is definitely in my Top 20 CD's of alltime. Cooper is truly underrated.
