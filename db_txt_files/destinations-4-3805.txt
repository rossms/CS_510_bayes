Nashville has the best highway system of any city I've been to in this country. Also, the radio stations are superb. As far as size goes, Nashville is just right. On the downside, while nightlife is decent, it could use a little more variety to go along with the country-oriented places. Also, if you head out of town to the nothwest on I-24, it seems the metro area just suddenly dies. Overall, Nashville is a decent city.
