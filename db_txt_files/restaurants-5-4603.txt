Wow surprised to see this on the list. My dad took me here, first Sunday after church in Texas, and I thought it was a beautiful restaurant, great staff, the food was really good. So was the coffee, which isn't always dependable in most other places! A bit crowded but like I said it was after church, in Texas. A common site. Most restaurants are crowded at that hour.
