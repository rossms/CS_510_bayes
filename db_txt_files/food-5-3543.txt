Samoas are a slice of Heaven on Earth..there is nothing more amazing than a samoa (heated up just a bit), eaten in small bites mmmm. I believe this cookie was my sole motivation for becoming a brownie and moving on to a Girl Scout. It upsets me that so few come to a box..but that makes me treasure them even more. If my Girl Scout cookies aren't delivered soon I think I am going to have some sort of attack.
