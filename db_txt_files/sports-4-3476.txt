One of the greatest players most people have never heard of. His stats speak for themselves. If you want to know how good he was, ask some of the pitchers who had to face him. He was somewhat overshadowed in Detroit by Denny McLain's bad-boy antics on and off (he won 30 games in 1968) the field, and by Mickey Lolich, a great Tiger pitcher who stood out in the 1968 World Series. I believe Kaline is one of the few major leaguers who never spent a day in the minor leagues. His quiet professionalism didn't help his notoriety, but he should be rated higher on this list.
