Update: Found the long cut on a long road trip and just threw the Skoal away. A perfect buzz, and that great tobacco flavor. The fine cut of the original never worked for me, but I ain't looking back now that I found user-friendly long cut (although it would be more accurate to call it a mid-cut compared to Skoal). Check that date though; the fiber can dries up since I'm not a heavy dipper. I tried the pouches recommended here by others, but prefer to calibrate my own dip size. Sometimes I put a small pinch under my upper lip when I need to be discreet.
