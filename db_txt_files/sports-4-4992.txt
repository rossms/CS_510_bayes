Maravich was not the best college player of all time.. want proof? He led the nation in scoring and single-handedly led his team to... a 20-8 record? Never made the NCAAs.. Larry Bird led the nation in scoring, and came within a hair's breadth of winning it all. Larry Bird, for one, was better than Maravich in college, and probably 10 or 12 others.. but Pete was good.. I almost ended up playing for BOTH of his high schools myself btw.
