Because she's sexy , blonde and somewhat controversial, you'll think she's not that good, but she really is a good actress. She was good in Casino, Basic Instinct, Sphere, and in an underrated movie The Muse. Total Recall was a good movie of her's as well. She's a better actress than people give her credit for.
