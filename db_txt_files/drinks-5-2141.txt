Oolong & black tea infused with organic peach puree - a tasty combination! Unlike Tazo's Giant Peach Juiced Tea, the peach flavor doesn't dominate the taste. Rather, it's used to produce a delightfully mellow character that's slightly rich and almost completely lacking in bitterness. Other ingredients include organic cane sugar and brown rice syrup, which contribute to this beverage's 60 calories per 16 oz. bottle.
