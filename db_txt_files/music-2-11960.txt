I think that all of the girls are very taltented but you would never know that they are because you only hear and really see Beyonce. I think that her parents have alot to do with that and it is not fair to the other girls ( that is why i think the other girls left). In a singing group it should be just that a group thing. I feel that maybe Beyonce should go solo. ( which she is doing already and have the other 2 girls as back up kinda like it is now.) They are all really pretty girls, and i think they should knida stop focusing only on beyonce's beauty......
