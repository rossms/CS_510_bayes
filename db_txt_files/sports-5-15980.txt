After winning the Heisman, how could this guy have fallen to the middle of the first round? He is an absolute stud. He is a big back (about 6-3 or so) and he's incredibly durable (hasn't missed a game in his four years in the league). He can run around or over the defense and catches the ball well out of the backfield. He also has the lowest body fat percentage in the NFL (or close to it) and is chiseled. He sometimes gets overlooked when the best backs are discussed (TD, Edgerrin James, Emmitt Smith, Marshall Faulk), but he is right there.
