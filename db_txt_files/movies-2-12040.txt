This was a little funnier than I expected, but still terrible. It had aliens, a giant women, and killer goats. Plus two annoying idiots on screen for an hour and a half. After seeing Ashton Kutcher in something else besides That 70's show, it's obvious he has no range as an actor. Which means he will be in may more terrible films like this.
