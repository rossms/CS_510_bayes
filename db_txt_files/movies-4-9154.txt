. . . not really a comedy at all. A bizarre story about how a odd man finds a portal into the mind of another human being (in this case, for some reason, they chose John Malkovich), and it goes into what he (and other people) chooses to do with this newfound entertainment. An interesting story. Also, on a side note, I found the puppeteering in the movie to be really fascinating (not the story that the puppets portrayed, but the skill in which to make the marionettes show expression). If you like bizarre movies, this one is good for you.
