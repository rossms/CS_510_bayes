The most awesome street I've ever seen for atmosphere and buildings of historical interest. Not to mention the exciting nightlife. When walking anywhere along the 3 miles of this amazing street, I always have an expectation of something about to happen. As for shopping: if you cannot find it here, that is because it does not exist! Most shops stay open until 2000 or later and there are also many outdoor markets. It even has its own website www.nevsky-prospekt.com and there are some awesome St. Petersburg street scenes at www.photofora.com/eugene/guide.htm
