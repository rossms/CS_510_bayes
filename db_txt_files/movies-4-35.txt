This movie is great. For those of you who like action adventure with the depth of Harrison Ford, you will not be disappointed. If you've seen the movie before give it another look sometime. It is always entertaining. Much like other George Lucase movies (Pre Episode One), you can count on this one to be highly entertaining and rich in its settings. This movie is worth a look just for the locations alone.
