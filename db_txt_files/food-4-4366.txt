Fritos bring me back to my childhood. Growing up, I would always bring the same lunch to school. Tuna fish on one of those Arnold's soft rolls and a bag of Fritos. While I don't eat them as much as I used, I do buy them from time to time as a change of pace. They also taste pretty good when dipped in ketchup.
