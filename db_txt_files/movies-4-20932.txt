I liked this movie I thought it was a good movie. It had wonderful visual effects and nice scenery. This movie is a little weird in some scenes but when you look beyond that you'll see it is a heartwarming love story. It is one of those movies that can make you cry though it is sad. So overall this would be a good movie to see if you have not seen it yet.
