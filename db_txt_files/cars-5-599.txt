I bought my 1200 Custom in 2001 and love it. I have had a 85 NightHawk, 86 Sabre 1100, 87 V65 Magna all great bikes. But none compare to my Harley. It is a great low torque fun bike to ride. If I was just getting my first Bike or a smaller Guy, I would get the Harley Low Rider for the lower center of gravity. But no other Harley can corner or keep up with a Sportster 1200.except mayber the New V-Rod. I can take the My Wife and Gear too. I think My Next Harley with a be a Wide Glide or Duece.
