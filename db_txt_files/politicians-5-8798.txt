Better president then W. I don't agree with the way he lied about the whole Monica deal or what he did. Tarnished him, but it doesn't seem to bother people as he get's big $$ for speeches and his museum is overkill. Maybe the Blue Dress will be a featured exhibit someday? The fact is times were better, the deficit balanced and a surplus was handed to the W and the US wasn't involved in any expensive both life/money war.
