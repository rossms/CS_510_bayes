If you can afford to go to other place, avoid Jakarta. There's nothing to see there. It's just a typical metropolitan city. The always-jammed streets would make you even more stressful than you were before you came there. The food is good though. That's why I decided to give it 2 stars instead of 1. Thank goodness for the delicious food. :P
