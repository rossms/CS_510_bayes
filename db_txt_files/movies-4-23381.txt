This, as with many artsy films, is a not a film for everyone. I found it thoughtful and deeply emotional. The journey it takes you on is heartbreaking and smile-worthy. Jim Carrey is impressive in a tough performance where he doesn't stray to his typical manic persona. Kate Winslet shines in her role of eccentricity and vulnerablility. It sweeps broadly through the gamut of emotions from melancholy to comedy to love. I was completely touched by this film and think it may be one of the best of 2004.
