Salt Lake City is truly a beautiful city with clean streets, nice looking houses, and really warm, friendly citizens. I do not think the skyline is the greatest out of all the cities in the country, but it still has temple square which is just absolutely beautiful. One must see the temple in SLC to truly understand the beauty behind it. Salt Lake City is definately a city I would live in if there were more jobs available in the area.
