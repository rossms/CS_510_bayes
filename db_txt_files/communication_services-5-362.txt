CellularOne is terrific compared to Sprint, Nextel, Cingular, and T mobile. CellularOne is about the ONLY company to give the customer nearly twice as many minutes for thier dollars. CellularOne is ONE of the few carriers to have a TRUE national plan. There is NO hidden roaming charges or long distance charges.
