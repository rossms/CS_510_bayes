There's no denying that it's a formulaic teen road trip movie. Nonetheless it has some inspired moments... like the robot fight at the Louvre, the oversexed Italian on the train, and the International House of Sausage at the beach. Great cameos by Matt Damon, Jeffrey Tambor, and Fred Armisen (from SNL) also. Great music by Lustra and some very funny bits during the end credits. Deserves a much higher ranking on this list.
