Are you kidding me? This is the toughtest QB I've ever seen. I was at the game against Pittsburg at Lambeau where Kevin Greene knocked the snot out of Favre on a sack. He had to sit out the next play as he vomited up a little bit of blood and was out there on the next play. That's what I call tough!! When this guy retires, I will be in mourning for years.
