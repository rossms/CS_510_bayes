A very dexterous player. A 6 foot 9 inch point guard. He was the all-time assist leader until Stockton broke his mark. Magic's diversity was great. I also have to give credit to him with an accomplishment for HIV research off the court. Over 10 years ago, he announced that he, a heterosexual, had contracted HIV. This displayed to mainstream America in the early '90s that anyone could get it, and ignorance should not be encouraged on the topic.
