Wow, what can you say about the Big Dog? Getting paid millions, but refuses to suit up because he was told he would be coming off the bench. Offered the starting job when Kenny Thomas goes down, but says to O'Brien the 4's not really my thing - meaning if he can't play swing man, he won't play. What a joke - nice way to leave your legacy, and great way to live up to the Big Dog nickname. I'd take a team full of Willie Greens, John Salmons, Andre Iguodala's before I'd ever give one more minute of PT to this bum. He gets two stars ONLY because he has the sweetest mid range J in the league.
