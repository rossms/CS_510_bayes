Diamond's Rio 500 is the successor of its little brother the 300PMP and excels in many areas. First of all, it's a USB device, overall is great. Unlike the 300, it works with Windows 2000, ME and 9X without usage of 3rd party applications. The standard management software is easy to use, but not the best there is for power users. If you have Win. ME, use Windows Media Player instead. The devices interface is easy to use and intuitively designed. Music can be sorted according to genres via folders and random use/repeat modes that adds a lot of variety to the songs stored on the 64 MB built in card.
