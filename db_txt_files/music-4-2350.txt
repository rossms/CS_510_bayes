It's not as good as their debut album, but it comes very close and is a pleasant surprise following their disappointing Much Afraid . On this album, Jars have returned to their old method of creating rich and creative arrangements that vary from the bare bones guitar-base-drums mold, while not merely re-creating their older sound. I hope it pleases God as much as it pleases me.
