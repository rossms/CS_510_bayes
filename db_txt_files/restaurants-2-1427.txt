The food is barely passable. And they price everything so that it's nearly an even dollar amount. The last time I went to the one near my home, I told the carhop to keep the change--HE just threw it on the ground. I haven't seen anyone on skates in a long, long time. And this is in Okc, the supposed home. I think I'll go somewhere else from now on. In fact I haven't been back. The food isn't THAT good. They can bite me as long as they play those stupid commercials--as far as I'm concerned, anyone who would eat there IS a moron.
