Ronald Reagan was a likeable human being, for the most part. As a President, he had some horrible policies. It has never been clear to me if he really *knew* what people in his administration did, or had someone do, on their watch (for example, the massacre at El Mozote in El Salvador). His administration sent the national debt through the roof with defense spending. Of course, that level of debt doesn't seem as bad in comparison with what we have now. Personally, there is a lot to like about this man, so I feel kind of bad giving him a low rating. But his policies stunk!
