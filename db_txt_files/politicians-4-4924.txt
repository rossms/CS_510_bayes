A good man. Too far to the left to mount a credible presidential campaign and still stick to his roots. Conversely, he was pro-life back in the early 80s. Now, he's pro-choice. I have to be a little leary of his character since abortion rights is the primary litmus test for any Democratic presidential candidate. He's made some other turnarounds when he began to get ambitious.
