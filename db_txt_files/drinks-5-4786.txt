The most unique soda pop flavor ever invented. Some people love it, others hate it. I love it but I'm not always in the mood for it like I might be for a root beer or another more 'typical' soda pop. I'm still not sure (though I could fine out if I wanted to research it) where the flavor is derived from. Is it from some type of root or plant related to licorice? Anyways, it's unique and great.
