Hands-down the greatest coach to never make it to the final four. It's a poor shame that Keady wasn't able to tap the great resource of Indiana high school basketball like Bob Knight could, but he still managed to give the general some great battles. The fact that he drew a 17,000-person standing ovation at his last game in IU's Assembly Hall is just another testament to how great this man is.
