Kyle Korver is one the best 3-point shooters in the NBA I think. One of the reasons I like Korver is because he played for Creighton (which is one of my favorite basketball teams) and the second reason is he plays for the 76ers which I think is one the best teams in the NBA even though they went through a little rough patch there where they didn't win any games. And yes the 17th was Kyle Korvers birthday. GO 76ers!! and GO KYLE KORVER. and like sixersfan13 said he is doing his job just fine. GO 76ers!
