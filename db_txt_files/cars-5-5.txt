i have a 03 yamaha wolverine. This quad is a great quad. It is the only sport quad with 4 wd. It is pretty good in snow and great for hill climbing. What i suggest though is getting the 4x2 warn select and the 375 or 400 bore kit. I have the 375 bore kit with the warn select. I burned a 250ex and tied a supped up 300ex and yamaha blaster. This quad is pretty fast considering it weighs 477. I really do recommend this quad. Also remember honda sucks!!!!!
