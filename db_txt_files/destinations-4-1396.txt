my mother is filipino and i went once. it's a unique culture and the people are usually very friendly. it's like a charming south american country (from 500 years of spanish rule) mixed with asian/pacific heritage and influences. you'll be safe as long as you stay in and around Luzon, the northern of the three main islands. the other two in the south are where the muslim terrorists are.
