I like Korn's prior 3 albums, but Issues marks a huge step down for the band. A thoroughly pedestrian effort from them, the band does nothing innovative, the songs completely do NOT rock at all, jonathan's vocals are uninspired. it has a couple of good moments which kept it from getting a 1 from me... but i'd highly discourage purchasing this one.
