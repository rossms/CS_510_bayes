This is an excellent book. I found myself reflecting on this book as I read it from various angles. It is a commentary I believe on the horrendous foster care system which thrives in this country. It is also an excellent coming of age story. Astrid is a remarkable young woman and possesses insight beyond her years throughout the novel. Finally it is also a commentary on a mother daughter relationship where the parent child roles are often reversed at least in thought. Read it thoughtfully, descriptions are excellent and observe Astrid as she searches, often in the wrong places, for herself.
