Tastes like nothing (suprise!) with a slight hint of pepper. Feels smooth going down with a slight burn after that. As always, wait until there is heavy condensation on the bottle. Reasonably priced(though you can do just as well with Burnett's for quite a bit less) compared to the so called upper-crest of vodkas, could never figure paying a lot for something like Vodka. Good straight as well as in a Screwdriver.
