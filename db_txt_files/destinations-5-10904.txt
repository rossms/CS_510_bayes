I went here for about 5 days and let me tell you it was the greatest time of my life. I went in October so the lines weren't a real problem and the humidity wasn't bad. I probably like Epcot the best. Both MGM Studios and Magic Kingdom were good too but Animal Kingdom wasn't that impressive. Overall if your going to a theme park resort then go here since it's the best of the best!
