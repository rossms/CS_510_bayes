He has so much talant and he's so supportive of his teammates...he really gives the whole team a lift. They all say they feel more confident when Kirk's out on the floor. Plus he's soooo HOT and he was super sweet when i met him. I think the fact that he stuck around for his senior year says a lot of good about his character.
