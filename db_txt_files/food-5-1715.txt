I love twizzlers. They are so, so tasty and enjoyable. I love that strawberry flavor to it, because it's a lot different then other strawberry flavored candies, as it doesn't waste it as a candied fruit, without using as much sugar, but is very healthy and doesn't have to be considered a candy in medical terms.
