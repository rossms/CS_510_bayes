The former Dorval airport will be going through a facelift, but I say that this is a good place to arrive and depart from as it is much closer to downtown than Mirabel. I enjyed this airport because it is streamlined through check-in and through the citizen verification checkpoints. Hope to see the new one when I vacation there again...
