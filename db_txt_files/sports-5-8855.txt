THE GLOVE! Is there anything else I need to say? Gary Payton is the best at everthing, he can shoot (he can score) he is one of the best defensive players and he does all this while dishing out assists plus he can get rebounds given the fact that he is a point gaurd. When Iverson does something other that hog the ball and just score let me know. I want him to get some triple-doubles sometimes but he doesn't because he never passes the ball he reminds me a lot of a guy named Kobe both can score but need to learn teamwork and that is another great attribute to Gary.
