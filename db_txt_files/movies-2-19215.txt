From Dusk Til Dawn is like watching reruns of the HBO Tales From The Crypt series. It's usually nice seeing George Clooney act, but you don't even want to let him try in this because you know that he will flop. The film is about vampire hunters that go to a bar one night, and are seduced be vampire strippers, and they are held prisoners in the bar all night, and they might find a way to stop them.
