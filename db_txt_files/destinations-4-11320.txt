Atlantic City is a dump and it is amazing to see people who seem to be to their last penny gambling it away at the craps table. Still, A.C. is the best gambling on the East Coast. There are a lot of options on the boardwalk, even if it does get pretty crowded. If you aren't a high stakes gambler, be aware, it is pretty tough to find $5 and $10 tables at night, near impossible on the weekeend.
