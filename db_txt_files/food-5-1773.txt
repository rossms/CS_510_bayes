pez is an old school thing! It's cool, I remember when I was a kid and I had like 20 pez despensers and alof of pez candy. I had batman, superman,mickey mouse, donald duck, cows, kitty cats, a horse one, a dragon, some more disney characters, some more WB characters, like daffy,bugs, and tweety. I hated the WB ones so I bashed them with a hammer and pounded them into the dirt. I also hated the donald duck one so I threw it in the creek and it hit a cow! pex was a cool thing, but it didn't last that long.
