I have bought lots of things mail order from here. They delivered fast and fitted perfectly. They have washed very well and were fantastic vaule. I like their pants especially as I am pear shaped but they fit like a dream. Being British I have never visited the store itself but look forward to doing so when we are posted to the US next year.
