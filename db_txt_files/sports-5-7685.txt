Great Knicks center. Awesome big man at a mere 6'8 although listed at 6'10 . Shut down Wilt in big games. Perhaps the greatest moment ever in Knicks history is when he walked onto the floor when his playing was doubtful in game 7 of the NBA finals on May 8, 1970. Then he proceeded to knock down his first 2 jumpers.
