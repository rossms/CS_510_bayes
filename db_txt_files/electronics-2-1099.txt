Like all the others, they really pushed their specials at me at the malls. Not till I went to Pac Bell at a regular store did I learn that, the best offers were only on 2-year contracts, which I can't use for my 1-year needs. The town where I am staying in has a poor coverage regardless what system I choose. The phones they're offering won't work back to my home in Norway.
