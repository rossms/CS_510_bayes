While I can't speak for ALL of the colleges in the UMass system, I do find that in-state tuition is very reasonable, the campuses I've visited are very lovely, and there is a wide variety of courses to choose from at each school. There are at least 5 colleges at the university level and about 8 or 10 (give or take) at the state college level.
