Definitely my favorite male character on Friends, and probably my favorite of all the people on the show. Most of the other characters (Ross in particular) seem to be getting more stale and annoying as the show drags on, but Joey may actually be getting more entertaining. Still, Matt LeBlanc hasn't shown us that he can create more than one good character. His movie rolls have been terrible - Lost in Space, for example, was a joke. And didn't he do some idiotic baseball movie where he co-starred with a monkey?
