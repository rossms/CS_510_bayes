It is a modern progressive American city that for better or worse has the smallest minority population of the top 50 markets in the US. With this deficiency, this town lacks some of the cultural diversity that other large cities have, contrary to what the locals think, it can be sterile. Overall, city is very prosperous and offers as much to do as most cities minus a large beach.
