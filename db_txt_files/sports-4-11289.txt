Anyone who believes that any coach could walk in and do much better than Gailey has done at Tech isn't paying attention. Acting spoiled fits a Tech fan the way moral indignation fits a Clinton, (it doesn't). Gailey is a solid individual, and is the most dedicated HC that the Jackets have had in many years, and that includes an alumnus. Being inconsistent is a drag, but it beats being consistently bad, or consistently living with a secret resume-enhancing lie.
