A wonderfully innovative game that suffers from bad level design. Yes, the undead are scary (especially when they make the sounds they do in this thing), but they aren't too much of a danger to a fleet-of-foot thief. Too many of the stages don't require you to be stealthy, which is too bad, seeing how well done the lighting, sound, and AI were done. Thief 2 corrects these problems and really requires stealth, though it isn't nearly as scary as this one.
