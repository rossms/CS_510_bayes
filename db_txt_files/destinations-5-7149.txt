Out of all of european cities, madrid and barcelona are at the top. Everytime i ask someone which country they enjoyed the most the always saySpain. Why, because spain is still yet "undiscovered" for the beutifull country it is. Many people don't bother going to spain because they don't know much about it. But if you go to spain you'll get enjoy it more than you expected. Its full of nightlife, History, Art, Culture, and good food.
