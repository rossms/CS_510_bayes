Denny's is the remainder of a whole category of similar places - Sambo's, Shoney's (before they shrank due to bankruptcy) and so forth. All bad, all open all night and all not supposed to be more than they are. Still a notch above a Waffle House (just barely) and usually a gamble - some have fair to acceptable food while at others you may be risking your life by eating there. The one in Burlington Vermont can get so rowdy they actually employ a bouncer on weekends!
