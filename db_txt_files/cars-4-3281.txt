QUESTION - '97 Grand Cherokee Laredo - LOVE MY JEEP but have a question. My car has died on me while coasting to a stop or at a stop...not good for So. Cal. busy freeways - it sort of sputters and you have to hit the gas or it will die. The dealership says it didn't do it for them, had it over night, and no failure codes have registered. Anybody have any thoughts?!
