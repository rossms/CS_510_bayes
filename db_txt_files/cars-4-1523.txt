Not a very sexy car, but mechanically it is a very reliable and safe car. The care is easy to maintain and service yourself. It is also cheap to maintain. If compared to a Honda Civic EX with a 1.6 VTEC and a 5-speed manual. My Saturn SL2 with a 5-speed manual has faster 0-60 acceleration, slightly better gas mileage, and it is cheaper to service. Drawbacks are in style, comfort, and the availability of after-market performance parts.
