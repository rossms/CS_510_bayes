Why is no one taking Stoudemire seriously as an MVP candidate? While Garnett is having another otherworldly season, the T-Wolves are currently out of the playoff picture. That's not to say that I wouldn't take Garnett as MVP today, even if Minnesota misses the postseason, but I'm ashamed that Amare hasn't been recognized for his breakout year. Sadly, most casual fans will credit Steve Nash with the Suns' run, while Stoudemire has been superior to almost every player in the league.
