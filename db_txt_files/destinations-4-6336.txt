I live in Columbus and it is awesome here. We've got lots of great bars and clubs, 3 or maybe even 4 top of the line shopping malls. There are plenty of other things to do as well. You can do the same things here that you could do at any other major city. Since I am rating the state and not the city I am giving Ohio a 4 out of 5. There is a lot of country between the three C's and certain times of the year can bring forth unpleasant weather.
