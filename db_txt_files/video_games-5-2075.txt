Without a doubt in my mind, the best all around wrestling game to date. Most wrestling games today, the only way you get a shot at a title is if your lucky. On No Mercy, you can create your own PPV's and put all the titles on the line and defend them against your friends in stead of the computer only. If THQ would take the indepth movment, graphics, and player entrance options of Xbox's WWE Raw 2 with the PPV mode of No Mercy, I think it would be the greatest Wrestling game ever.
