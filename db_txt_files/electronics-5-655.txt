I have had this phone for a couple of months and I don't have a single complaint. Great features include voice recognition dialing; caller ID; a log of your last nine calls made, received, and missed; and a phone book. I also like the fact that it is small, but not too small so that when you are using it, you actually feel like you're on the phone.
