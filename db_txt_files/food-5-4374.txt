This stuff brings back memories. We used to buy a pan of this and take it camping with us. We would be in our cabin out in the woods with no electricity and we would build a fire inside the cast iron stove, and cook up a batch of this. We don't have our cabin anymore, but Jiffy Pop brings back those good memories of the time when we did still have it.
