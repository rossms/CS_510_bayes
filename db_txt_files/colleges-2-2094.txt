UNL is adequate at best. People are not very nice here. Educational quality is acceptable. Social scene involves people getting wasted, every single weekend. I hate it. I only go there because it is cheap for me, and everywhere else cost too much. Classes are ok, but not as good as I'd expected. My calculus professor can't even speak English! This is ridiculous.
