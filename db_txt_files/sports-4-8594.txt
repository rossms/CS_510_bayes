Hey whats up, I want to know what all that mes about Kobe having a girlfriend in Philly and then dissing her coz he wanted her to stay at home all the time and she wanted to stay in school and graduate, then going and getting married to Vanessa whats-her-name. He didnt even tell the girl in Philly that it was over between them. And how come they got married so fast..is she pregnant or something? Does this vanessa really love the guy, or is it about $$? IM NOT HATING I love Kobe, Im just curious.
