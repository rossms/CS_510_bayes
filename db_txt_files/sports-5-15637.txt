An absolute hammer of a saftey, Watch him flex his guns after a big hit and you'll see he's just a stud player. The reason he doesnt have as many stats as a Sammy Knight is because he's played on good teams that have playmakers that make plays. Dawkins doesnt have to make as many plays as a Knight. Dawkins hits like a Linebacker yet can cover WR's in the nickel backfield. He's a leader as well.
