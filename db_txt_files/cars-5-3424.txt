I purchased my new 2001 RAV4 5-speed L model on 2/27/01,and I am very pleased. With exception of an automatic transmission, I ordered every available option, and so equipped, it is very nice looking and quite comfortable. The fit and finish is first rate, goes and stops well, and handles great. The ride is well controlled with comfortable seats and low wind noise. If you want a small SUV with good gas mileage and reasonable size (driver and front passenger have ample room, and two rear passengers fit easily), test drive the new RAV4. I think you will be surprised at how much this new model has improved.
