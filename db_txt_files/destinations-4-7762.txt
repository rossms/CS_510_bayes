When I was a child I used to love this musem. Not only was it a great museum it is like an amusement park because some of the exibits ypu can actually play on. I rate this a 4 because with age the childrens museum just isnt as interestring. So heres a helpfull tip if you have children it will be a great idea if you are visiting or currently living in the boston area you should take them to the childrens museum
