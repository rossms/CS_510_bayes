A nice variation on the FF series. It takes micromanagement of the characters found in the other games to a whole new level. The real difficulty of this game are the long movie sections that cannot be avoided and cannot be ended early. The AI is not too keen with its tactics as well. A solid and fun game that really gives you a chance to create a vast array of characters.
