Chris Leak is definitly an outstanding QB that has proven many people wrong, especially stating that he is only a sophmore. Chris Leak is ranked 16th in the NCAA football association, not to mention that there are 258 total. The kid has had 28 passing TDs and 2 rushing TDs with only 14 sacks and 10 interceptions. Since he's only a sophmore, he has 2 more years to show all his talent. Without a doubt, I'm guessing that he'll make it to the NFL. Someone would definitly have to do some serious arguing to say that this kid's not good.
