 I never purchased this album myself but I have heard it alot. Although I cannot identify with alot of the lyrics I respect it. All the messages a pretty much possitive and nicely delivered. I hated this album in middle school. But looking at the sad state of music today I wish she was still around. I respect music about women and songs that women can relate to. We need more of that these days with artists like Kid Rock, Insane Cilown Posse and Limp Bizkit around. A breath of fresh are in a testosterone filled land of Rap Rock.
