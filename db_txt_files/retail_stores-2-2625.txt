My least favorite grocery chain in my area. I dislike the layout of the store. It is really disorienting, and not conducive to traffic flow. Not as crowded as Wegman's, but pretty darn bad. Produce isn't that great, and prices are not exactly warehouse like. If you live in Northern VA, AVOID AVOID AVOID the Little River Turnpike (Fairfax) location!
