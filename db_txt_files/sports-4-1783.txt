Great rich history and great rabid fans make for interesting combination from spring to fall, every year. The team has much heart, most years, and now this year they are again playing smart, fundamental baseball; almost like the good fun days of Whitey-ball. Grew up w/ Lou Brock as one of my heroes. Always meet friends at the Stan the Man statue when going to the games. Now in the World Series, playing against my 2nd favorite team... Go Red... Birds!
