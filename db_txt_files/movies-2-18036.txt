I have to admit I only watched this movie because I heard John Travolta had a small part. Otherwise... I didn't really feel any symphaty for Carrie, she was so annoying, as was her mother. I already knew many parts that were going to happen, and they were a lot cooler in my imagination. However it gets 2 stars for the ending. Kinda unexpected and a little bit creepy.
