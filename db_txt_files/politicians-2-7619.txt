**Sigh*** I know I may get chewed out for this, but I seriously think Lincoln is an overrated president. He severely abused his power in office, generally for bad things. He imprisoned people without trial merely for opposing the Union engaging in warfare. Oh yeah, that stuff you heard about him being such a defender of blacks? It's a bit exaggerated. He tended to consider black people socially inferior. The Emancipation Proclamation wasn't a bad idea, but he possibly did it for strategic reasons rather than moral reasons. Summed up, while he kept the union together, he used awful means to do so.
