The only university that I would absolutely forbid my kid from going to (when i have a kid). The drug abuse at this university makes graduates seem like war vets. My sister went to Boulder and every one of her friends had substance abuse issues. She graduated in 5.5 years, which was the fastest of anyone in her immediate circle. Other friends who went to the school have similar scars. The campus is nice, the town is beautiful, the setting is gorgeous, but there are some institutional flaws going on at this place that is doing a disservice to its students.
