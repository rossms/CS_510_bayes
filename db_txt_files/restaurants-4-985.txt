Almost gave this a five. Their chicken caesar salad, with fresh, hot chicken put on is AMAZING. This is my staple meal, along with a chocolate chip cookie and a bottled water. (their cookies are great). The lines sometimes move slow and the seating tends to be limited....they could work on the atmosphere here a little bit. Still, great, healthier food at fast food type pace.
