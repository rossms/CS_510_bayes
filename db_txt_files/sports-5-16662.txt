Patriots front seven isnt enough to stop the Steeler run, and when the PAts bring extra men to the line, the Steeler pass will burn the PAts. Look for the Bus, Duce and Plax to have a big game, the Steelers are too physical and the defense is dominating. The Colts were not physical enough to compete with New England, but the Steelers are. And the Steelers are Super Bowl bound.
