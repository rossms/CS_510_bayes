As am academic in a relatively high income bracket due to consulting, I probably would see some tax savings from Bush. However, in the long run, Bush's plans will lead to higher interest rates which will even hurt the wealthy. MORE IMPORTANTLY, for middle America, Bush's plan is very bad news, and they will feel that immediately if he wins. No question, Gore is the clear choice for anyone who cares about the Economy.
