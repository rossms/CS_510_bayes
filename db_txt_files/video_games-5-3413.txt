This game rocks and when it came out it was the topic of conversation among teenage guys who were hooked. And I would know because I was one of them. The graphics are awesome and you can choose from some of today's top pro skaters and choose different places to skate. If you play for 10 minutes you'll get hooked and be playing all night.
