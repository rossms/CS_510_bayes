The man could shoot as well as anyone. He could elevate with anyone. He was a good rebounder and was improving as a ball handler. Good defender al be it not great. Could run the floor with anyone. A fantastic player that would have been an even better pro. His game was made for the NBA. 25 points a game and 8 rebounds would have been well within his realm. Undoubtably would have thrown in a couple f 30 point averages in his career as well as 1 or 2 10 rebound averages. Huge tragedy.
