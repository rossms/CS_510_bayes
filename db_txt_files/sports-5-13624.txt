A Hall of Fame coach, the best in the history of the NFL- not only has he won 3 Super Bowls with 3 different non-Hall of Fame quarterbacks, but he won those Super Bowls with 3 different running backs. Coach Gibbs will win a fourth!!!! The Redskins went through Richie Petibone, Norv Turner, Marty Schotteheimer (who, by the way, did a great job in Washington) and Steve Spurrier, before they found the only man to lead the beloved Washington Redskins out of the wilderness- "Hail to the Redskins"!!!!!
