I had been to London about half a dozen times before I visited the Tower - should have done it the first time I was there. Although in a sense it's not particularly spectacular, it is linked to so much in British history, and is so well presented (opportunity to speak with the Beefeaters was a high point for me), it's almost obligatory to visit it.
