I spent an entire week shopping for a cordless phone, and I tried seven phones before I settled on the Sony SPP-900. I have not been disappointed. The phone has great reception and is relatively light. The beep that you hear when you turn on the phone is not ear-piercing (as it is in almost all of the other models I tried), and the volume can be turned down to a comfortable level. A friend of mine said that she had a similar experience shopping for cordless phones, and she ultimately selected the Sony model, too. I highly recommend the Sony SPP-900.
