Having lived all across the country, it amazes me whenever I meet someone from Los Angeles that they can't imagine living anywhere else. Why anybody would want to live in a sprawling mess of a city with endless traffic, choking smog, crass superficiality, and no clear downtown, when the much more attractive and beautiful San Diego is less than two hours away, is beyond me.
