The 12 year old boys mother is seriously depressed and suicidal. the boy is very lonely with no friends. Markus the boy is considered sort of a geek. Will played by Hugh Grant could use some growing up himself. The boy and man become friends.the man becomes more mature and wanting to settle down . the This movie kind of shows how each other touches others lives. Pretty chaming movie. not great but good.
