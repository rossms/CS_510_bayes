No exaggeration, lions may eat you if you sleep out in the open. If you go, stay sheltered at night. Rainy season is around December, so-called winter is around July (just windy and chilly at night -- no cloud coverage, heat goes up). Can get there by departing from Gaborone by train or by the main road from Gaborone going north. If you hang out in Gabs at some of the bars/eateries you'll meet people going north, sometimes can hitch ride on private plane. But once you get north you'll need a Landrover. Oh yeah, serious AIDS problem, take extra precautions.
