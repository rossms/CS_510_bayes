I think he's fabulous, and so talented!! I love watching him on tv or in any film. I just wish that I could see him in more stuff. I think that all foreign films should be made available for the US. I've even seen his stand-up act in Italian, and although my understanding of Italian is very limited, I thought he was funny still.
