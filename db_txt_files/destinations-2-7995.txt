LoDo definately has a nice mixture of bars, clubs, restaraunts, cafes, etc...but it is a very dangerous place to be if you are homeless. A few years back, not sure if it was a serial killer, or just some punks on a spree, but several homeless people were murdered..a couple decapitated just for being homeless. It creeps me out to visit LoDo now...
