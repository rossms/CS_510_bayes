This was a great film, to me the only significant failure was the movie cliche' ending. The entire cast was superb, I don't see how anybody could watch this film and not have something resonant within themselves. Real life is not usually warm fuzzy feel good and that is not what I like in films, either. That's one reason why I liked Family Man in spite of the sell-out ending (she should have gotten on the plane).
