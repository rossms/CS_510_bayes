I think Chipper Jones has contributed to a lot of the wins that the Braves have accomplished. He is great at both defense and offense. Also, hes great from both sides of the plate. AND for all you other girls out there who put comments about how he looks good....you shouldnt. He is not a piece of meat. He is a great baseball player.
