the most senic country in the world. every land type known to man (except maybe tundra, but i think you can find that in the himalayas) exists in india. some of the freindliest people ive met in my 27 years on this planet where from india. yea, india has problems, but nothing they cant eventually overcome. thats what separates india from countries like pakistan and saudi arabia, countries that will never progress and join the 1st world.
