Like the current jerk-in-chief, LBJ is yet another Texas turd. I'm being generous giving this conservative-in-Democrat's clothing two stars. A terribly unrefined man who got lots of Americans (and others) killed, to no good end. I'm sure good people come out of Texas, too, and maybe someday Texas will put someone decent in the White House. They need to make serious amends for LBJ and GWB.
