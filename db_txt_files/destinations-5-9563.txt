Definately something worth seeing while in London.The figures are amazingly realistic and lifelike,and the vintage clothing is impressive.There's plenty of history to be learned here,and in a fun way that will appeal to everyone from young children to the elderly.I especially enjoyed the Macabre displays,which are definately NOT for everyone,as they are quite gruesome. There is now a Madame Tussauds on 42nd Street in Manhattan,but I have not gone in it yet as the admission is a bit steep.
