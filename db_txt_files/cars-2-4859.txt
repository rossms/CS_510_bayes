Cracked up dashboard not due to negelict. No help from Dodge on replacing it. They would not even pay half of the cost. They said there had been no problems with the dash, however, try to find one at a junk yard that doesn't have cracks. I traded my 1999 Dodge, I have bought about 7 dodge vehicles but I just bought a new Chevrolet 2500 HD disel. I would never buy another Dodge since they do not stand behind there products. By the way I am very happy with the Duramax Chevrolet.
