I have been searching for years for a cigarette I can call my own. The Blend 27 is it!!! A rich, smooth and sweet sensation. No nasty aftertaste.They also taste the same from pack to pack which I didn't find with most brands in the past. I hope these are around for a very long time; if not I hope the Marlboro folks let us know ahead of time so we can stock up.
