This is a fantastic story written by a very talented, and at the time, very young writer. Regarding the reading list status, I think it's unfortunate that that is a factor for people. Personally, I don't have any hangups about something being on a reading list or not. Also, on a side note, i do think it would be helpful if the reading list were updated more often as there are great contemporary books out there that most children are missing out on.
