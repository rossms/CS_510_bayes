Given its cult status, I thought this movie would be far more interesting. Director Michael Crichton explores the premise of an amusement park gone horribly wrong. Most of the film is concerned with establishing man's arrogance as a prelude to when the robots go berserk. It's quite effective, giving the film a paranoid aura when the guests are forced to contend with the brutality of their former playthings. The flaw with this movie is that the characters are pretty uninteresting and many of the scenes are needlessly overlong. Watchable, but not a classic.
