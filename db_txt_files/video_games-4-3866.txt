This game is fun to play head to head with a friend, but against the computer it's not as good. Season mode and draft are new features which adds to some gameplay, but overall it's too easy now, with too many moves.. Personally, I like the Gameday 1998 the best. It has a much better gameplay. The graphics are improved on Gameday 2000 however.
