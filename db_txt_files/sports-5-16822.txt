What can I say? The Packers are one of the all time best football teams. Under Brett Favre, they've never had a losing season! And as long as he's with them, they'll continue to be a regular Superbowl contender. When he retires, who knows? I'm inclined to think that they'll continue to do pretty good, if not as good, because I think a lot of effort will be put into finding a good successor to Favre. GO PACK GO!!!
