My roomate is an Okie boy, so I am not allowed to talk trash about Stoops, but I do consider him to be one of the most solid coaches out there, so I guess he will be cool with my opinion. UPDATE: An off year is an off year, but can you honestly say a coach is the root of it? Nah. Cycles are part of college football, and OU is caught in a rebuilder right now. If they continue to struggle next year there will be something to discuss.
