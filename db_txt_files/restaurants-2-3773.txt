I think their slogan says it all: The best pizza VALUE anywhere. Emphasis on the word value. It's as if even they know their pizza isn't so great... and the commercials don't even say the pizza is good. What the pizza is, however, it's cheap. They have a daily $3.99 all-you-can-eat buffet bar with different kinds of pizza... none of them very good, but you can eat as much as you want. They don't make good pizza, and they know it... but at least they don't charge very much for it!
