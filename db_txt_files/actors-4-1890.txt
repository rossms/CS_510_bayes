A very versatile and gifted actor whose hits are greater than his misses. Seems to have an uncanny ability to get to the root of the character's psyche, whoever they may be and no matter how far removed from everyday existence. Although it was good to see him nominated for an Oscar last year, I believe he should have been nominated for other, more substantial roles in his career. (i.e. Edward Scissorhands, Donnie Brasko, to name a few)
