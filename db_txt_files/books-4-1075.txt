 Stellaluna is a very nice picture book about a baby fruit bat (Stellaluna) who loses her mother and is raised by a bird. Stellaluna struggles to be like her nest-mates, but her differences make it difficult. I won't ruin the ending, but I will say that it is a happy one. The illustrations are absolutely mesmerizing, and the story moves along at a good pace. At the end of the book, there's a nice section containing facts about bats. I highly recommend this book for kids ages three to eight.
