I almost cried (not, but hey its grafical), when i heard Ms Foster turned down the part as Clarice. Is there a reason to this ?, and if yes, is it good. I wonder if Hopkins had a chat with her, he he. No jokes aside, i hope the new Clarice is as convincing as she was, she WAS Clarice, now she is not. HER MISTAKE, and by turning it down, she turned her back on us, the people who liked/loved her, in the part !. Just thought i should speak up, S ren... PS. H Lecter is the best descriped fictional character ever, he is absolute.
