Not as good as I'd hoped, but not as bad as it could've been. The effects are the whole show, really. The proposterousness of the characters and their antics will surely have a lot of people rolling their eyes, but films are made to be entertaining, they aren't always made to make some huge philosophical point, and this one certainly wasn't either. Don't expect a lot and you won't be disappointed.
