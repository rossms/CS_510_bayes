Unreal was, in my book, revolutionary. It took not one, but at least two giant leaps forward in terms of graphics, which still hold up quite well today. The game was beautiful, atmospheric, and fun. The monsters were scary, and the weapons were unique. The game's engine was so powerful that it was licensed for about a million games after that including Clive Barker's Undying, Unreal Tournament, Deus Ex, Rune, Klingon Academy, and a bunch more. A true classic.
