Top tourist attraction is Dallas. Lots of exhibits and information about JFK. You'll see stuff that you won't see elsewhere. On demo is a representation of cameras and pictures from the cameras that were taken by tourist and professionals during that horrible event. An eerie feeling looking at the spot where Oswalt fired the shots. The corner where Oswalt is at is actually enclosed in a plexiglass. The original window was taken out for display and preservation. No photography is allowed inside the museum. The seventh or top floor is an art gallery. The grassy knoll is well preserved also.
