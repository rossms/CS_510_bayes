Nicely drawn, but it appears somebody has buddies reading this board. NO other strips belong in the same stratosphere as Peanuts and Calvin Hobbes, let alone do they legitimately 'top' them. Seeing all the comments about how Raising Duncan is a true portrayal of scotties, seeing all the comments seem to be from owners of these dogs, tells me that this strip belongs in Dog Fancy magazine. Unless there's a Scotty Fancy. That would be better. Again, great drawing, but 'tis not funny.
