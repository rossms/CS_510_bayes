Livin' La Vida Loca has to be the best video of all time. A very original song, great musicians and a singer that has all the qualities that make a truly international mega star. Talent, looks, charisma, a beautiful human being inside and out and let's not forget that Armani wardrobe. And that hot wax scene has to be the most romantic and sexiest of all time. This is the best video ever!
