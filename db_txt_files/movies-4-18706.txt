I agree with many of the others here who were dissappointed with Reaves & Ryder's acting. Both are beautiful people (what a shame) but there acting here lacks element. Oldman and Hopkins are decent. The visuals are good, and I like that they tried to stick to the original. A bit long at times, but a good vampire flick.
