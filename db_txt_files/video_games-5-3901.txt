If you like role-playing games (RPGs) then this is the game for you. This mildly violent game takes you through different levels battling animals and bad guys but mostly involves manuvering the beautiful Laura Croft through trap doors, mazes, and secret passages. Make sure you do your homework before you start playing because once your into it, it's hard to stop.
