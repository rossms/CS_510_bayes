Orlando is definitely a good actor but not such a good dresser. *LoL* When my friend liked him a lot, she'd share pictures of him with strange outfits that made me want to scream, Orlando, you can't wear green polkadots with a purple and yellow striped coat! Please, no more! I liked him as Legolas, though, and he was really good as Blackburn in Black Hawk Down .
