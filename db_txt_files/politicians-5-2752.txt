I really liked this guy. It's too bad he stepped out of politics but to be honest with you... his class was so far past a politician I'm sure he just felt like he didn't fit in... sort of like a sixth grader not wanting to play with a second grader because the younger one is still eating his boogers. Gee... I think my analogies are getting better and better every day!
