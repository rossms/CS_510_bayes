Tiffany's is the greatest jewellary store ever, a lil expensive for us people who live in igloo's and cant even afford to move down south to warmer climates. I'd love to eat breakfast there though, dontcha know...pastries and coffee, just like audrey hepburn....Yummmm...ya know, it can really pick ya up down at tiffany's at 6 am, it can really take all of your cares away...just ask holly golightly
