Okay going into this movie I thought I was goin to see the next best movie of the year but was that what i thought as i left? Finding Forrester was poorly written. The acting was straight out sad. Sean Connery was great though haha i love him. I really have nothing to say except if your in the mood for a family movie that wants to make your cry and get all lovy dovy okay go see this movie but on the other hand if you want to see a real movie go see something else
