I love seafood, and yeah there are other places that make it better, but Red Lobster has sort of conditioned us on what is good seafood at moderate to high prices on somethings. Their rolls our delicious and yeah they can be made with Bisquick, but who cares. Lunch is the best time to go because they have lunch specials.
