Papa John's pizza has lots of sauce and lot's of crust. These are not my favorite qualities in pizza. The cheese slides all over the place when you pick up a piece because there is so much sauce and if you aren't very careful you are liable to have a big pizza mess on your lap. Although the sauce is extra tasty and there is lots of crust to feed to my dog and dip in my coke it is not my favorite pizza ever. If my dog had to rate the pizza, she would give it a 5 because she got to eat so much of the crust. I prefer Amici's, I guess I am a thin crust person.
