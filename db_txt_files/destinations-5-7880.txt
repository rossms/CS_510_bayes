Adler tends to get a little ignored, as it's right next to the more popular Shedd Aquarium and the Field Museum. But it's worth seeking out - even if you don't have a great interest in space, the planetarium itself is a lot of fun. And if you do have an interest in astronomy, this is a can't miss. It's nicely located a little further out along the lakefront, just far enough from city lights that you can see stars. And, as an aside, the view back towards the city from here may be the best photograph point in Chicago.
