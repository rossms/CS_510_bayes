I have read all the Red Dwarf Books twice. Both times I read them I loved them and I am sure I will read them again. They are very cleverly written and unlike most books I read, they kept me guessing all the way through. I loved reading about episodes that I had already seen on TV and would recommend anyone who has watched th series, to read the books.
