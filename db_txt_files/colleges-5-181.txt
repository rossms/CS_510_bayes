This school has improved over the past 10 years in leaps and bounds, if I were rating-it-all several years ago I would give UM Bus. a 3 but today they are worthy of a 5: new buildings, improved curriculum, more-diversified profs, and a TREMENDOUS Executive MBA program on nights and weekends. Great job for turning things around.
