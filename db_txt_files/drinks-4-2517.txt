Ive had the chance to experience so many high end champagnes that Roederer's Cristal almost gets lost in the fray. It has a nice dryness and creamy texture. However the fact that it was Cristal which is extremely popular and commercialized sort of overshadowed the fact that it was indeed a great bottle of champagne. If you are looking for a outstanding bottle of champagne you could do much better with your 200 dollars, however if you are wanting a conversation peice I recommend the Cristal. It's not as good as Soutiran or Bollinger though but fun to bring to a party.
