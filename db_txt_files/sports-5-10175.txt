I met Dan when he came to Salem, Oregon to coach football at Willamette U. He too the team from 3-6 seasons to a winning season the first year he was there, and continued for 4 years to take them to the national championships his last year, then he went on to Boise State to do the same. Dan's a smart guy, a strong family man and a character builder. He believes in academics as well as sports, supports and builds up his guys. I expect he'll be moving on to even bigger things very soon.
