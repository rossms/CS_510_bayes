Definately worth watching. It's not so much of a horror flick so much as it is a psychological* suspense kind of film (so don't go expecting to be scared, you'll be disappointed). Two men wake up to find themselves chained in a room, while a voyeuristic psycho watches as they try to find a way to win his disturbing game. Nice twist to the ending, Cary Elwes gives a fantastic performance. Only difficulty in the movie is to make sure you keep up with the multiple time lines, but so long as you pay attention you can keep up. (*edited for spelling)
