I love the romantic, old-fashioned look of the dresses and skirts from Laura Ashley. I know they may seem outdated to some other women, but sometimes I just love to dress in romantic clothes. It makes me feel very feminine. I love the lace and lots of the prints are just so cute. I don't like to wear her clothes for every occassion, but sometimes it can be fun to dress-up in something different. I'm glad that Laura Ashley offers some clothing that is different than the clothes that everyone else is selling.
