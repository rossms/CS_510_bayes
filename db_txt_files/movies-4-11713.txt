A somewhat dry movie that asks a little bit of patience until it gets rolling - but sufficient character development and excellent acting kept my senses tuned to the screen. Not to mention beautifully simplistic camera work. Turned out to be an excellent movie for those who enjoy movies about depression, insanity, boredom, and the complications that they all entail...in other words, a movie about life. Watch it :-)
