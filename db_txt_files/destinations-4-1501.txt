Totally great country with some of the friendliest people on earth. The scenery is terrific and the women are most outstanding and will approach YOU before you have the chance to hit on them. Of course, there is a lot of poverty and crime in all areas. Those darling little street urchins may look cute and pathetic, but they'll have your throat slit in the time it takes you to blink.
