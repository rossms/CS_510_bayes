WoW!!! This stuff must be good! I did a little research on this product and found out about 90,000 cases of XS Energy drinks are moved daily. Also, the company BALL that makes the cans (also makes the cans for all the soft drinks and energy drinks) admits that XS Energy has the highest order placement of any of the drinks. They must be moving a lot of product. Way to go Quixtar for marketing an energy drink and finding an arena that no other drink can compete in!
