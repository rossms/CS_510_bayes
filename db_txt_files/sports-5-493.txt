Too many idiots with opinions, that know nothing about baseball and obviously never played the cathers position or the sport! If they did, they'd know there's more to playing cather than throwing out runners! Calling a great game with your pitchers, blocking poor pitches and catching pitches (fielding %) has always been more important than throwing out the occasional runner.
