A handsome man, but even more important a compassionate man. He exudes the kindness and warmth of the side that's in the light.Even kickin' butt and dealing death he seems to carry the weight of the good guys.If you haven't seen Ang Lee's marvelous Crouching Tiger,Hidden Dragon treat yourself.Chow Yun-Fat is good. When they are flying around in the trees fighting it's so beautiful to battle like the mythic-gods.
