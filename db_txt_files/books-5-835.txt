What can I say that hasn't already been said? I couldn't put this down, I couldn't put the next three down, and I can't wait for the next book to come out! My (then eight-year-old) daughter read the first four through immediately and has re-read them since a number of times. Anything that captivates both adults and children is a true classic.
