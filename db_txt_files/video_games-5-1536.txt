This is one of my favorite Gamecube games. The story is gripping, the controls are intuitive, and the characters feel very real. One feature of the game are insanity affects. As the game progresses, your character becomes more insane, and weird things start to happen. Many of them can be highly entertaining! Everyone needs this game in their collection and it can easily be found for under $20 these days.
