After Sandy Koufax finally tamed his blazing fastball, he enjoyed a five-year stretch as perhaps the most dominating pitcher in the games history. He won 25 games three times, won 5 straight ERA titles, and set a new standard with 382 strikeouts in 1965. His fastball and devastating curve enabled him to pitch no-hitters in four consecutive seasons, culminating with a perfect game in 1965. He posted a .095 ERA in four career World Series, helping the Dodgers to three Championships. Sandy Koufax was inducted to the National Baseball Hall of Fame in 1972.
