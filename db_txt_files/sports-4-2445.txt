I feel sorry for the city of Montreal. In the season of 1994, they were in first place with alot of talent... then the STRIKE came. Every since then they have been nothing, and the attendance shows it! Now they are moving to Washington. SIGH They could have at least moved elsewhere... Baltimore is TOO close to Washington for baseball. Sorry Montreal, keep your head up high. Maybe some time in the near future you will get another MLB team.
