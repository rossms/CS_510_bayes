A fine actor but one I always found as sad. In many roles his characters were the sad sack or somehow suffered at the hands of others. The Man Who Shot Liberty Vallance and a few other westerns showed a side to him I enjoyed at times. I wouldn't put him in my top 5 so I can't rate him a 5. he probably deserves it though.
