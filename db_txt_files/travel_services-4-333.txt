My first flight was last year, from Glasgow to London on a small BA plane. The seats were comfortable but there was little legroom. The staff seemed helpful and friendly, though, and the food that was served was surprisingly nice! I don't know what the larger planes are like for international flights, but I was satisfied with my experience.
