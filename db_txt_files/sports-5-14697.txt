Quite possibly the most deserving player without a Super Bowl ring (along with Dan Marino) before finally achieving it in both his final two seasons with his beloved Denver Broncos, John Elway initially seemed star-crossed. But Elway showed heart against seeming odds, persevering through sports writers' and fans' criticisms and a coach who disliked him immensely (Dan Reeves). His patience and talent finally paid off against Brett Favre's Green Bay Packers in Super Bowl XXXII and culminated with his final game and Super Bowl MVP performance in game XXXIII.
