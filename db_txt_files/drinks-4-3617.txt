This drink is taking the world by storm. Last time I was in Berlin, everyone was drinking them. It's really good, as long as you like sweet, sugary drinks. Be careful when drinking this stuff in large quantities, though...like champaign and other sweet drinks, it'll hit you pretty hard the following day.
