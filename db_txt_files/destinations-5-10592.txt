In Michigan a pack of Marlboros from a 7-11: $5.70 gas station: $5.45 smoke shop: $4.95 Kentucky's Best from a smokeshop: $3.17 Don't let the price fool you. I loved every variety I tried (Menthol Light, Full Strength, Unfiltered which still sold for $3.17) were excellent. Ultralights were a little too Ultralight for me. Definitely give them a go.
