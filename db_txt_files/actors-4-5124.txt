I like him. I think it took a lot of guts for him to take such a controversial role so early in his career. I think he can pull it off because he's geniunely talented. Oh, and it definitely doesn't hurt that he's adorable! I Can't help but laugh at the sexually insecure people on here who rip on him simply because he plays the role of a homosexual in ONE movie. These people probably have a secret stash of gay porn on their computer somewhere. LOL Those who foam at the mouth the most (and go on and on and on in extremely long homophobic posts) are the ones who usually have something to hide...
