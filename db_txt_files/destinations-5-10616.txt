Really, really good smokes and well worth the extra money. I have never had a problem buying hard packs, especially if you buy cartons from an online retailer. (This definitely keeps cost down as well - I've seen them sold on websites for as little as $25 to $28 a carton). I like the rich flavor, and to me the fact that they burn slow is definitely an indicator of their quality. (BTW, it is easier to get a good drag if you take slow, long drags).
