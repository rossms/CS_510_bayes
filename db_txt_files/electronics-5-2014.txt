You have got to love the old Atari game system if just for the fact that it was a huge step forward in home video game technology at the time it was released. The best game around is still Warlords for this platform. Warlords features up to four different competitors playing with paddles in real time trying to knock out human and/or computer opponents, a highly competitive game which my friends and I still enjoy. I just wish some of the newer consoles would bring back this game with all the new technology that could be used to make it even better.
