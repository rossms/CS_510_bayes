In regards to the comment made by QualityEng about Honda's safety-- the 2003 Accord was rated as a best pick by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety. The Institute gave the '03 Accord a good rating (highest possible mark) in each of the categories tested in the frontal offset crash test. The Civic, CR-V, and Element are also best picks . Honda owners can sleep very well at night knowing their children ride in some of the safest cars in the world.
