I just got back from freeport and it was probably one of the best weeks of my life!!! The weather was perfect and the people were lovely and sooo nice! The ONLY (and i mean ONLY) thing that let me down when i was there was a restaurant in Port Lucaya called the Prop Club... They had terrible service, and after two hours of waiting to get our orders taken and getting our food, it was cold and not even done, and the manager did ABSOLUTLY NOTHING about it. So i strongly recommend that you Do not visit the PROP club... but other than that mishap the trip and everything about Freeport was GRRRRREAT!
