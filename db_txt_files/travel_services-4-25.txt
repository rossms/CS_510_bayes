Though expensive, I would like to stress that, IT IS THE ONLY AIRLINE THAT SERVES COMPLIMENTARY FOOD AS OF NOW. Due to this, have great service and if you do not have to care about the money you spend, they are on time or early on their destinations. (May I remind you that they have a hub in Cleveland?) They have cozy seats and fine movies to watch. If they are going to lower their costs, I will fly on them again.
