They probably don't deserve a 5 (not yet at least), but something has to be done to move them up on this list. I know it is still early and they have won only two games, but they look damn good. Their offense is more dangerous than it has been in ten years. Kerry Collins looks like the real thing: he has shown great patience, not made mistakes, and has dangerous wide receivers. And, the running game has looked equally impressive, particularly Tiki Barber who is playing like Barry Sanders. With the defense strong as usual, the Giants can go deep in the playoffs.
