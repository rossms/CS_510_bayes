2001 supercrew 2-wd lariat. Only 30K miles so far, but no problems. Been hit by morons twice, both little honda units...both destroyed (I mean totaled) My damage was mostly cosmetic. This is a vehicle that I will let my kids drive! Didn't really want a ford (ex windstar owner) but I'm guardedly optimistic, and see nothing here about class-action-type problems (which is the norm for other ford products) Typical suburbanite...haul loads of dirt, and gravel, crap to the dump; mine's only 2wd, but still pretty good in the mud.
