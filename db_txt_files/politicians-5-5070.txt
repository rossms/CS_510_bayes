I watched all the debates and Al Gore was, by far, the clearest, most understood and the best leadership person for the job. I was interested in everything he had to say regarding my interests for the future. I couldn't understand anything that Bush had to say because nothing made sense. As I've heard commented on Radio, his cabinet is such because he needs adult supervision . Al Gore understands the people and Bush does not. I find Bush a pea-brain and I'm sorry that he was appointed. Now that the Florida count is in.....Gore did, indeed, win.
