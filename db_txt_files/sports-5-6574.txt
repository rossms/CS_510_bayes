Princeton is one of the greatest programs in the country. They have a knack of scheduling games with powerhouses (UNC, Kansas, Kentucky, etc.), and often beating team or coming real close to it. They strike fear in any college coach come tournament time, as their unique offense hasn't been cracked in the 30+ years it has been used.
