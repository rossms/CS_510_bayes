Borders is a chain bookstore that feels like an independent bookstore. The selection of items is varied and interesting, and you'll find things that are not typical chain-bookstore fare. I always find the salesclerks to be knowledgeable and willing to help. The sales are great, too, which is an added bonus. Borders is definitely my first choice in chain bookstores.
