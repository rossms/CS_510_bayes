Big place for shopping eating. I remember there being a Planet Hollywood, and nearby is both an ESPN Zone and a Barnes Noble. Plus a real unique gift store called Crabby Dick's (the area is known for crab fishing). That's all I specifically remember.Probably one of the best looking parts of town. (there are bad slums in Baltimore, but not close by)
