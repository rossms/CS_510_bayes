I love Diet Mountain Dew Code Red but can't find it in the New York Area. I only get to drink it when I go to Orlando Fla. on vacation. Does anyone know how I can get some shipped to me on a regular basis without having to pay an arm and a leg? (Or does anyone know ANY store in the New York areas that stocks it? Please leave info on this website!
