I think Mr. Lott should step down as Minority Leader. I do not feel he has lead and that he is more concerned about playing 'nice/nice' with the Dems instead of standing up to them. When you are on top, as the Republicans were, you have to fight to stay there instead of rolling over and coasting as I feel Mr. Lott did. Of course, Mr. Lott is not the only one to blame - I'd say many Republicans are equally to blame. They just weren't ready for leadership because they had been the underdog for so many years. They's lost their golden opportunity.
