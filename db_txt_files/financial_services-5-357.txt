I use to be a Bank One customer then switched banks. Due to mergers I am a Bank One customer again. I have totally free checking. I have found the customers service to be much improved since what I remembered. I travel and I now have access to my account in AZ, UT, TX, MI, FL IL. My old bank couldn't do that! Bank One gets my vote for the most improved bank!
