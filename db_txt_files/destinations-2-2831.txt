Was not too impressed with Philadelphia. Every city has dirt but driving into Philly from the turnpike, trash, garbage, dilapidated houses as I past the stadiums. Dilapidated highways. Downtown kind of drab compared to Boston and New York. Lots of history, and old neighborhoods. Kind of the forgotten east coast city compared to New York, Boston, Baltimore and Washington. Just an ok time there. No plans of going back.
