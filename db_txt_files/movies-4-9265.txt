Terrific movie...Mel Brooks is the king of spoofs, I'll grant him that! If Star Wars ever had to be spoofed, I'm glad Mel did it! Would have a perfect score if not for the actor portraying Dark Helmet...sorry, I'm just not a fan of the guy who plays him. (Rick something-or-other? He played in Honey I Shrunk the Kids... )
