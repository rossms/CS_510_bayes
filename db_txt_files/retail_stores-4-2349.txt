I like this store very much - the prices are good, I like the way the store is laid out, it's well lighted, etc. I don't mind bagging my own groceries at all, and the store where we shop accepts debit cards also. They don't carry all the products we use, but that's fine. I like the selections of bulk foods, the produce section is great, and we will continue shopping at Winco.
