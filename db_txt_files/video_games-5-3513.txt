Although I'm not too into RPG(role playing games) I love the animation for this game. The animation is awesome, and truly brings the characters and the story to life. Compared to its earlier version, FF8 has definitely come a long way with its animation and special abilities. This game has inspired me to go into the field of computer animation.
