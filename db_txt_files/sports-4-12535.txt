Michigan has suffered at least 3 losses every year for the past 4 seasons. I cannot imagine that is good in the minds of Michigan fans. Still, they continue to rate the team as great currently. Overall this team is slipping and needs a big year to re-establish themselves as a top program. Another 3 loss season and they might be worth an okay rating.
