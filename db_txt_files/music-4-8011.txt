I love the song, the Chili Peppers, and absolutely love the video. It was highly innovative and echoes this time period well (the recent video game craze is something that I think will be associated with the late 90's and the beginning of this decade, kind of a definitive point as much as Pac-Man and Frogger are synonymous with the 80's.) It's a very fun video to watch.
