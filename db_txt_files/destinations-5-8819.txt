Great stuff, right next to Levi Garrett. Garrett's better but Redman's a close second in terms of taste. Redman leaves are a little thinner and therefore rip up easier/quicker than Levi when you chew so it doesn't last as long. Also the flavor runs out quicker. You also get alot of little scraps instead of nice long strips. All these reasons make Levi Garrett a better choice for me, but Redman is a very close second. Taste is great.
