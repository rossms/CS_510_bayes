All in all, a great educational buy and a fun place to meet people. Though Carolina hasn't had a strong sports tradition, things are DEFINITELY looking up (thanks Lou Holtz!). A fantastic honors program and a good location (easy drive to the beach or mountains) sealed the deal for me -- I'm a Carolinian for life.
