A professional team that is owned by the fans - nobody else in the Nation can say that. It amazes me that a city of just over 100,000 people can fill a stadium with over 70,000 people even when the team was awful - not to mention the harshest weather in the NFL. Packer fans are the real deal. There are none more dedicated in all of sport. Packer players are treated like royalty in Green Bay, and the consistently comment on how amazing they are compared to fans of other NFL teams. The Packers are truly a unique and amazing franchise.
