A few years ago my family and I made the long trip from San Francisco to Boston. It is a long trip but worthwhile. The Freedom Trail is perfect for a short trip because you walk past all the significant places to see. You get the perfect amount of scenary, history and tourism. I really enjoyed Boston as a city too. It is so different from what I am used to on the West Coast. I got more of a sense of United States history while I was in Boston. I highly recommend the Freedom Trail for anybody.
