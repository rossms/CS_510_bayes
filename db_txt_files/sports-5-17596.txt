Anyone who doesn't think the rams have a defense is wrong they have adam archuleta and a heck of a defensive line and on offense they have one of the best kickers ever they also have marshall faulk a great runner and they have marc buldger who although through a lot of interceptions won pro bowl mvp and if someone wins pro bowl mvp you can't argue with it the rams are great
