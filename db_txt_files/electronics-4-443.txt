Just got it, so far so good. One major drawback though, you cannot control TV volume with the remote. Not a big deal if you have a remote for the TV but if you have an older model w/o remote then you have to go to the TV each time you need to adjust the volume which is often these days because of how the fluctuate the volume levels during commercials. Will add more later as we use it more.
