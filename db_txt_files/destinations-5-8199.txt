This is the best motion simulator ride that I have ever ridden, and it's even more than a motion simulator ride! The experience is incredible. Yes, I am a Star Trek fan, but I was with someone that isn't a fan, and he enjoyed it too. It's expensive, but if you pay once, you can ride as many times as you want that day. I rode it twice in a row, and would have gone back for more if I had the time.
