Selection is usually very good. If it's not available, they will special order or look elsewhere. Meat grade is OK; meat area service mostly very good. Other in-store services are a positive. Check-out is timely but sometimes lack sackers. Deli's are popular and generally of excellent quality. I have shopped Hy-Vee at least 20 years; try others and come back.
