Very addicting game--It's a neat puzzle game which relies on colored gems piling up in a competition (vs. computer or other player). It's a fairly simple game, easy to learn, but challenging. I think the game was made in 1996, but it just recently came out on the Game Boy Advanced system. If you like puzzle games, this is worth a try!
