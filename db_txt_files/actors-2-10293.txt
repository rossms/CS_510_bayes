The reason why I don't like Michelle Pfieffer is that she tried to make a sequel out of the classic musical Grease, and actually make the original classic look pretty goofy, because the sequel was so bad. Yes, she has had some good movies, but she really always looks kind of nervous and unwanted in her roles, and she doesn't really want to bring joy to the viewer.
