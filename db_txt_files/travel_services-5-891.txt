Eddie and his crew were so professional and efficient! They even drove me back in the truck to Ozark because I had never before driven a U-Haul truck! I rate them a 5-star rating because they dented nothing and were so fast and considerate about my Mom's dying. PLease hire them!! You will not go wrong!!!
