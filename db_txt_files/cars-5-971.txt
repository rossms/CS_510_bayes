Especially in EX-V6 trim, the Accord feels and drives like a junior Acura RL. The Accord remains the benchmark against which all family sedans are measured and no heavy discounting or low rate financing from any Ford or Chevy dealership will ever change that. The domestics may be cheaper but in the end you get what you pay for. Just try comparing the resale value of a 5 year old Accord with that of a 5 year old Lumina and you'll see the difference! That's if the Lumina is still running by the way......
