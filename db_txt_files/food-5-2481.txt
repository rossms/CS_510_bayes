As far as cholocate bars go, Butterfinger is on my Top 5 list. The actual chocolate is good, and the peanut stuff inside is cruchy and yummy. Requires a toothpick later though, but it's worth it. It's great with a stone cold glass of milk. Also, if you have a blender at home, throw some good vanilla ice cream (or whatever you want) and some milk in it and make a thick milkshake. Then break up a Butterfinger bar and stir it in. Hit the pulse or chop button a few times. Instant Butterfinger Blizzard (and cheaper than DQ). VERY yummy.
