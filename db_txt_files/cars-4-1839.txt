Solid vehicle if you like it. Most people wouldn't buy these because they are hard to drive (rear drive), and are pretty big cars, but the car itself is above average. Its based on the Ford Crown Victoria. However, this one is more appointed for passenger use. Gas mileage is okay. Handling is typical rear drive. Comfort is a big plus. Resale values are suprisingly low, but the car is above average when it comes to reliability.
