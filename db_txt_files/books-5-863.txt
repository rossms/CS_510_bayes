An absolute classic, so why on earth is it so low on the list? This story has been enjoyed by generations of children and children today still enjoy it. You have the boisterous Peter Pan, the boy who never wants to grow up and has a gang of children who follow him to fight the notorious Captain Cook and the pirates. Then there is Wendy Darling with her two younger brothers and their dog Nana. Wendy and her siblings have a fantastic adventure in Neverland and eventually return home. Very enjoyable and an amazing adventure for the whole family to enjoy!
