What can you say about Allen Iverson? Explosive, talented, emotional - the man leads the same life off of the court that he does on it. Iverson plays hard, and he plays hurt. He has some growing up to do, but that doesn't take away from the fact that he is perhaps the quickest human I have ever seen. Hope he stays with the Sixers.
