I personally like swiss cheese, in sandwiches, french onion soup..in casseroles etc..however, I don't always eat it..you definitely have to be in a swiss mood, it is rather strong..since my kids and husband don't like this strong cheese, I often use Alpine Lace swiss cheese..it is softer in texture..many small wholes, melts nicely and isn't quite as strong as regular swiss cheese.
