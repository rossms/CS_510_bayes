He is an extremely misunderstood senator, he is never taken seriously be anyone on the right, nobody even wants to debate this man because the right wing knows that he can absolutely slaughter them in a debate. Ted Kennedy has been around 40 years in the Senate and he's one of the best there is. I'm rating him based on his legislative performance and not his personal life. His personal life gets a 0 but Legislatively he gets a 5.
