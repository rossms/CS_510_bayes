Tremendous jack-of-all-trades-but-master-of-none pickup. Anonymous evidently doesn't take very good care of his vehicles because no truck, GM, Chrysler, or Ford, can experience that kind of wear in only 40k. Wish the Ranger had a better engine to compete with the 4.3 Chevy and the V8 powered Dakotas though.
