This is one of Julie's best. I rarely like a sequel or follow-up novel because the characters' personalities are rarely recaptured...but Julie does it VERY well. Now if she would just stop writing those stupid contemporary novels and get back to what she does BEST. Historical romances are her very best books, esp. those set in Scotland.
