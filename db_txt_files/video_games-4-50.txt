Half-Life is a surprise - an engaging FPS that will hold your attention even as it sucks you into it's involved storyline. Look up atmospheric in the dictionary and you'll find this game. The graphics are top-notch, but as in all creatively successful entries in this genre, it is really the sound that makes you jump. Just one caveat: be prepared for a long journey, as this game seems to go on and on and on. Just when you think you must be in the last level, another one comes along, and another one, and another one. But it's all worth it, as this will be one of the best FPSs you'll ever play.
