Pretty nice place, though there are too many people in the golden triangle and too few people everywhere else. Kingston is a great town, Ottawa is beautiful and historic, London has cool people, Windsor is within gloating distance of Detroit, and Toronto thinks that they're the centre of the goddamn universe. Of course, to get to southern Ontario from the west, you have to either drive through the states or go through 2000 km of absolutely nothing. Also, it's kind of in bad taste for anyone in Canada outside of Ontario to say nice things about the place, hence the 2 out of 5.
