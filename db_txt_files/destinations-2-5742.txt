No way i could ever live there, don't see how anyone else can. Walt Disney World is a great place to vacation, but that is it. I find it hard to believe that so many elderly people live there, they have a harder time breathing anyways, and durring summer, a 20 year old olympic athelete would need oxygen after 30 minutes of being outside.
