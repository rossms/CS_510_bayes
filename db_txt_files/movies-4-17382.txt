Different. Kinda like an MTV video, but with a good story, picturing 3 different versions and outcomes. Brisk, suspenseful, and stirring with the techno soundtrack. The subtitles didn't distract at all, and a credit to German films, which are usually a great cure for insomnia. This one kept you on the edge of your seat.
