I plan to visit Morocco someday.They have great music.In the 60s Brian Jones of the Rolling Stones went there and recorded The Master Musicians of JaJouka,who are professional shaman/musicians born into the trade and can trace their heredity way back.This fascinates me.Jimi Hendrix also loved it there & was influenced by their music.I also love Moroccan food.The architecture looks pretty interesting,too.
