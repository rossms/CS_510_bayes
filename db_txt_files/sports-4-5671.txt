His struggles in the NCAAs last year notwithstanding (remember, he was a few weeks removed from mono), Dunleavey can do it all. He is the typical Duke player a la Grant Hill and Bobby Hurly. He's smart, athletic, and works hard. With Carrawel gone and not taking up any of his minutes, I think he is going to have a break-out year this year. Also, find me a better soph. trio than him, Jason Williams, and Carlos Boozer.
