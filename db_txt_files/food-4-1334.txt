An underrated candy. I'm not exactly sure how to describe Werther's... They're hard candies - like those little butterscotch things - except the flavor is closer to toffee or something. The strange this is that I don't like toffee flavored anything, but I like Werther's. It's an old-time candy that's worth a try.
