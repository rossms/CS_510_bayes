A good, solid city. It mixex East Coast cosmopolitan/sophistication, with a nice hometown feeling to it too. Revitalizing itself a lot, probably the best emerging major city. The birthplace of the Nation. Also, the only Northeastern City without a distinctive accent. I don't have a problem with accents, in fact I think they add chareter to a place and I made a weblist on them, but it is nice to go to a place where you KNOW what the people are saying...... However I have to say that I am baffled by the fact that Philly is rated higher than it's neighboring NYC, philly is nice and all, but come on.
