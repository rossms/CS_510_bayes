I thought he did a great job in preparing for teams. The only reason he isn't a 5 is because of his failure to corral his players in the media. Part of being the man is making sure everyone knows you are the man - he didn't do that with his team all the time. Finally brought Ohio State's status up to what the Ohio State fan's perception. Can he keep it up?
