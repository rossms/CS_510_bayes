I've been to Marietta (near Cincy), Cleveland, Lorain, and Cincinatti (overnight stay due to flight delays). By far, Cleveland is the best place to visit in Ohio. The Flats is a fun place to visit (I SCORED at Shooters!!!), and for a relatively mid-sized city, it's quite the sports town (though the fans have not tasted victory in years). Just like the song says, Cleveland Rocks. Until this year, I never knew that Ohio was such a politically diverse state.
