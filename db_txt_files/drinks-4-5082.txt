Pepsi has it all over Coke in every significant respect, IMHO. It's lighter, fizzier, and ultimately more refreshing. However, having cut my cola taste buds on 6.5 oz. glass bottles back in the day, what passes as Pepsi today suffers in comparison to what I grew up with. In fact, the absence of Pepsi in any glass bottles means always settling for less, no matter how good it is compared to what else is out there.
