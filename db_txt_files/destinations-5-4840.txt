I must say that Belo Horizonte is one of the most beautiful cities in Brazil. It's not so big as Rio and SP (2 million people)but enough to have many interesting things to do. If I were you, I would pay atention in the archicteture and the trees of the city. Yes, trees! All the streets are full of marvelous trees, making the weather comfortable. And here is not hot!
