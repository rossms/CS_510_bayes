I have loved Taco Bell from the first time I had them about 12 years ago. However, they just got rid of my favorite menu item, the Chili Cheese Burrito (formerly the Chilito). I love just about everything on the menu! The Gordita and Chalupas are great, but my staple on almost any order at the Bell? Nachos Belgrande!
