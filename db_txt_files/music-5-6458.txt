Cooper has gotten back on a roll. His last three releases, The Last Temptation, Brutal Planet, and now Dragontown are his best efforts since his 70's heyday. Don't let Alice's age keep you from taking a chance on his newer work. Alice has gotten refocused on his music. I love the variety of Dragontown. Check out Triggerman,It's Much Too Late, and Deeper. Classic Cooper!
