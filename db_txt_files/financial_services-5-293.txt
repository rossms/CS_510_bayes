Hmm, I have had an account with Wachovia for years and never had a problem. I wonder why most of the people who are infuriated over Wachovia's policies all have a problem keeping their checkbook balanced. I also wonder why most of them have horrible spelling and grammar issues. I think you should put a negative opinion on this board when you have a legimate concern that is not your fault. Eighty percent of these complaints seem to be user error, not the bank's.
