I think so too! Harry potter is my favourite series of books. Ive read every one of them, and I love all the characters. The writing is superb. I hope she'll write some more novels after this series is over. I just found out that there is a wizard science course taught in university now that talks about things in the harry potter novels being accomplished by scientific intervention. I wouldn't mind taking that course.
