Although the Harley bashers are bound to chime in on any of these ratings, the resale facts and overall looks speak for Harely Davidson. Softails have the nostalgic look and are best suited for someone who likes the 'discomforts' of motorcycles. No fairings, stereos, etc. On the other hand, the weight makes them much more comfortable than Sportsters. The variety of styles H-D has created gives the buyer a chance to be an individual. I could afford to buy a new bike anytime, but I just like my FLS too much to part with it.
