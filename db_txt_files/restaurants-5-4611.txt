Favorite chain restaurant. My wife and I hate going out to eat because we know we're going to waste money on mediocre food and bad service. Carrabba's is an exception. Great fresh food. I love being able to see the fresh herbs in their sauces. Service is usually great. There's always a chance you'll get a slack jaw server anywhere really.
