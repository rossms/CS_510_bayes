I was down in Puerto Vallarta with a Mexican family that are friends for many years and they recommended I try Casa Noble Crystal, what an amazing spirit and from then on my favorite tequila. I have been a big fan of Casa Noble since 5 years ago, the complete line is excellent, from the pureness of the casa noble crystal to complexity of the casa noble anejo. If you like drinking high quality wine and spirits you will love Casa Noble 100% guaranteed
