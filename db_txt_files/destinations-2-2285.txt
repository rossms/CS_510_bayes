Ehhhh never been there so I can't exactly give a legit rating. But I'll do my best. So...they hate the US. Big deal. Plenty of people out there hate the US. Next reason why you all hate them? Okay, the scenery isn't particularly nice. I must agree with that. The scenery looks like a big landfill. Oh yeah and they have good caviar, too. Also, it's another one of those countries that treats women like animals, so I had to take off for that. Take off, add on, take off, add on, oh, what the heck, I'll settle at a two. See you all soon (I'm sure).
