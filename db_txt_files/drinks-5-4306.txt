This is, as another reviewer wrote, one of the three top rums, at least among those that are more or less readily available in the Western Hemisphere. The others being Rhum Barbancourt and Lemon Hart. None of them should be mixed, unless to get the 151 proof down to a drinkable level. Each is dark, flavorful, and smooth especially the Gosling's. I'd go a long way for three fingers of Gosling's straight up in a snifter.
