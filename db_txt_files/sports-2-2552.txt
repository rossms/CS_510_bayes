prolly the msot overrated gm in the game today. im sorry i just dont see what potential this guy has. i mean he has then 2nd highest payroll and were only 14 games above. i really dont think this gm is 2nd best buy this poll. i mean he goes and sings byhung hung kim after he gives the finger to someone and he had to go down to pawtucket because hes fastball is only 83mph. im sorry i just dont see why evreyone rates this guy so high.
