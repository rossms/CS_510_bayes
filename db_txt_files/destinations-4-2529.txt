Very beautiful mountains,trees,flowers and beaches!Pearl Harbor and the USS Arizona memorial are a must, along with Hanauma Bay,which offers one of the best snorkeling sites in the world.The negatives are terrible traffic,extremely high pricing and overpopulation in Honolulu and Waikiki.Overall the people are very friendly and helpful.
