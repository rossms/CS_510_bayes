I grew up watching Russell play - in my opinion he is tied with Oscar Robertson and Michael Jordan as the greatest basketball players ever. He was everything that the perfect center should be, plus he could have scored much much more if he had decided to play the game that way. Instead he was the hub of the offense and a fantastic passer out of the post. Just a truly incredible basketball player.
