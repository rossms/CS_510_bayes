The middle part of what I call the Passing the Torch trilogy (6,7,8), doesn't really have a lot of sense to it. It tries to upstage a certain similar event in Trek3 and fails. Still, a nicely done Trek movie that goes by so fast, you're left thinking, That's all?! And they cram a lot of fun Trek stuff in those 100 minutes!
