I'd agree with Groo. But I've definetly had fun so far in Montreal. In Montreal you can learn French, if you are so inclined, which is a bonus. But the school itself has been a disappointment. Student bodies are internationl everywhere now, as our successful alumni when you are talking about the world's best b-schools. I'm not sure why that translates into 5 stars. If you could place an Ivey or Sobey school of business in Montreal you would definetly have the perfect school! Until then you have to make your choice!
