My favorite place in Houston. A serene and moving spot, containing the last works of the great American Abstract Expressionist painter. Just outside the chapel is a reflecting pool with the sculpture The Broken Obelisk. Rothko is about silence: that perhaps silence is the only possible artistic reaction to the Holocaust. Stunning place, not to be missed.
