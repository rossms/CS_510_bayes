I'll always know him as Webster; he was cute in that role, and I got a kick out of his little giggle. When Webster debuted in 1983, Lewis' role was that of a six- or seven-year-old; I didn't know it at the time I watched the show, but in reality, he was almost thirteen! Now he's in his mid-30s, and he still doesn't seem to age. Recent pictures show Emmanuel Lewis not looking a day older than ten or twelve -- looks like the years have been EXTREMELY GOOD to him!
