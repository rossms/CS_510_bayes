I was surprised. After the extremely laughable shenanigans in JP2, I was expecting even less believeable plot lines and situations. I found this one to be better, however, and worth the price. Not a fabulous movie, but fun, with good special effects. (I read one of the scenes took 5 months to do 10 seconds!)
