I normally avoid franchise places like this like the plague, and am not a big seafood fan. I went here with family a few nights ago for the first time in years. The food was a pleasant surprise !!! I had an excellent grilled salmon, and all other dishes and appetizers were great also !!! Service was top-notch also. I am naturally pessimistic, I will see how it measures up the next time, that is the true test, LOL.
