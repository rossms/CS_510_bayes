I've been to about 50 airports around the world and hands down this is #1. More like a classy mall. Had cinemas and even a swimming pool if I remember correctly. And the immigration agents had mints to welcome you to the country ... and when the officer ran out just as I was handing her my passport, she excused herself to get a new bag and fill up the tray. Had to laugh. Clean, well lit and lots to do if you have to be at an airport. First rate.
