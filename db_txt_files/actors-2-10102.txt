I originally gave her four stars. Upon further review, I've returned to adjust her rating to two stars. She's been rehashing her glory days on film for the past 15 years. There's nothing new(other than that horrible Deceived movie). Her pinnacle came with Butterflies Are Free and she was funny with Chevy Chase, back when he still was remotely funny. She just hasn't done anything worth a damn in so long.
