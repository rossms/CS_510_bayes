Having recently met my future wife in TJ, I am decidedly biased in favor of the place. TJ is a suprisingly warm and welcoming place as long as you are polite and willing to have a good time. Sure, you have to fend off the constant advances of street hustlers trying to seperate you from your dinero, but once you enter one of the clubs, all is forgotten as you enter a state of alcohol induced bliss(minus those damn whistles!) Check out Animal and the Frog Iguana , but be careful not to drive the schoolbus while drunk, you may fall out of your seat and hurt someone.
