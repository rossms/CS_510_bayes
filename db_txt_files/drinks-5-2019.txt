My friend bought it for me since I started back on the South Beach Diet. I LOVE IT! The taste is amazing! You can't even tell there is Splenda in it. Honey is great for cleaning out toxins in your body. However, I knew it was too good to be true for Phase 1. It definitely helps kill sweet cravings, and gives energy. A DEFINITE MUST BUY!!!
