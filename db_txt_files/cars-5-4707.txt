I have a 94, 2wd, 2.2, 5-speed. Best little truck in the world. 25mpg, nice ride, handles good. It goes like a tank in the snow, because the 2.2 doesn't have enough power to cause any problems. Had to replace the head gasket at 100k, but thats normal for a 2.2. Only 2 problems: 4200gvw, buckles like a tin can when you hit stuff(maybe I should stop doing that). Easy to fix, parts easy to find. On a side note, most people with 2wd s-10s love em, 4wds just break too often. If you buy a 4wd, keep extra ball joints laying around, your gonna need them.
