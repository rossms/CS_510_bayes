We've owned three Maximas and every one of them has been a great experience. Never a moment of trouble. Just oil changes and routine maintenance, and these cars just keep rolling along. Powerful engine, good handling, roomy interior and trunk, decent ride, decent looks. Most important... very very reliable.
