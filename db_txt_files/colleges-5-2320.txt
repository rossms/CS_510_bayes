Bryn Mawr College-- there's a zillion good things I could say about the place. There's a strong sense of community. I have met so many interesting, strong women at Bryn Mawr. The academics are first-rate and the campus is at a great location. It's easy to go into Philly by public transportation, and it's within walking distance of small shops and restaurants. Several co-ed colleges are nearby, too-- Bryn Mawr is not isolated at all.
