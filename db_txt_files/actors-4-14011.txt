I am not one to go ga ga over celebrities, but I really enjoy watching Julia Roberts. I think she is a wonderful actress and very versatile..if you saw Steel Magnolias and didn't shed a tear during her talk with her mother about having just one moment of happiness, then you are made of stone! After seeing her in interviews, I can say that she seems like the kind of person you would want to be friends with. She seems down to earth and always gives an excellent performance.
