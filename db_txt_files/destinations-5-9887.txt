I've tried a lot of different cigarettes, and Nat Sherman Mints are by far my favorites. Smoking a marlboro or camel is mundane in comparison. The mint crystals allow the smoke to be extremely flavorful, and this is nothing like menthol. Each Sherman Mint cig is a treat, and I like to space them out and enjoy them as such.
