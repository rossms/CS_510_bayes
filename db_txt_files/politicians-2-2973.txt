I respect Jesse Ventura for bringing a sense of fun to governing and for taking unpopular stances and speaking his mind regardless as to what anybody thinks. However, governing is not just words, but it is also action, something which Ventura was missing in when he was parading around with the WWE and the XFL when he should have been doing his job. If Minnesota prospered under his reign, it was not because of anything that he did.
