This is what i have to say, subs ARE excellent, fresh REAL ingredients not that fake stuff. I love the toasty taste. The commercials are there marketing choice and it seems to work, a new quiznos just opened in our town and people have been lined up for days. I appreciate the friendly service at every quiznos iv'e been to. They may be more expensive than subway but thats for a reason! I am not saying subway is bad but between the 2 i would choose quiznos anyday. So if you want a quality sub go to quiznos I know you will enjoy yourself.
