This morning on sportscenter, he was called the most dangerous QB in the league . Damn right. He has the size, the smarts, the athleticism, the arm, the determination... After cracking his ankle early in yesterday's game, he wouldn't be taken out , choosing instead to adapt his game: this renowned rusher attempted zero rushing yds, reminded the crowd how sick his arm is, throwing for 255 yds (20-25) along with 4 really pretty TDs. Take notes young Thomas Brady. This is the QB you want to be.
