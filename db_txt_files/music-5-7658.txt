I don't care too much for the appearance of this group but you have to admit...you need to chuckle and laugh. I mean...TWISTED SISTER? How funny of a name can this be? Now, I understand that kids do rebel but to have the parent try to force his rules by blowing up the band or other things it is just plain redicoulous and that is why the VIDEO is so darn funny to watch. The song however is awsome to hear.....
