One of the best SS in the game. Not a clutch player though, and has never stepped it up in the playoffs. In 2003, his late slump carried right through the playoffs. Too bad the Sawx couldn't make the A-Rod deal. Getting Nomar and Manny would only be a positive, and getting A-Rod and Magglio would also be great. Team chemistry would be better and so would the team.
