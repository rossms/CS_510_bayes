Not only was I born in Louisville Kentucky, but check this out: When I was a baby, I met Col. Sanders. His wife had a restaurant called The Colonel's Wife, and sometimes he would come in and walk around and chit-chat with the customers. Well, my family was there, and I was asleep, and he came over to the table to say hello and asked if he could pick me up, my parents said OK, SO HE DID. Is that just wacky or what?????
