I'll never forget the Tootsie Pop tree I had at one of my birthday parties at the zoo when I was a kid. The pops were clipped onto the branches, and all of the kids got to pick them. Ever since, I've had a soft spot in my heart for Tootsie Pops. All of the flavors are good, but cherry and grape stand out as favorites. The soft, chewy, chocolate center is a nice complement to the crunchy, sweet, outer coating. Even today, I wouldn't turn down the offer of a Tootsie Pop.
