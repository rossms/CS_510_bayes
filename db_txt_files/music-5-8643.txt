it's amazing to see someone who ment so much to rock music in the 90's all over your television screen while listening to a song so intense that it's left as a, sort of, kurt tribute. a dead man is a dead man but this video brings kurt cobain back to life in all his light. i watch it as i get lost in his rare smiles.
