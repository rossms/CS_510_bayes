Patch Adams is a good movie. Robin Williams is at his best. Not only is it dramatic, but funny. The supporting actress does a wonderful job bringing Patch Adams down from his cloud of silliness. But he rubs off on her and his fellow classmates at a prestigious medical school. Soon they are making patients laugh and driving the dean of the school crazy. It's a must see.
