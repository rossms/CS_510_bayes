When most people think of Chris Webber's college career, they of course think of the tournament game against UNC where he made the mistake of calling a time out when Michigan didn't have any left. How annoying is it to hear that one play come up again and again? When I think of Webber's college career, I think of the game against Duke his freshman year where he completely faked out Laettner and then dunked on him. And look at Webber now - kicking ass with the Kings (while Laettner is shlepping away in obscurity).
