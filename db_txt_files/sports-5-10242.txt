The all around Coach. The administrator, the Field General, the recruiter and the father. It's everything a young man or parent looks for to guide young people. He not only teaches by the example. He lives by the example. Oh and Bill Snyder doesn't even belong on this list. What he did was great, 15 years ago. He plays weak opponents and then is like 1 and 25 against top 10 foes. I could do that. Can we get him removed from this list??
