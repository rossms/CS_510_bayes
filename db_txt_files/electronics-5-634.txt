I think the Samsung SCH models are tight. It's cool because it has the voice activated system. I had the 3500 first then the 8500. I like the features on it. It looks tight and is small. I like the weight distribution compared to the StarTAC. This phone is tight cause the batteries are in the bottom and the screen is at the top.
