The Barenaked Ladies' breakthrough album makes me wonder why they were so underappreciated for much of the last decade. The humor typically found in their lyrics is not as heavy on 'Stunt' as on, say, 'Gordon,' but their sound has evolved to a bolder and more mature level that is equally as catchy, but with more staying power. I definitely recommend it.
