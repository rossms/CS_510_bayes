Best running back in all of football, including college. People think he has a problem holding on to the ball. He doesn't. If anything he tends to fumble in spurts like 3-4 fumbles in two weeks. Then he will go the rest of the year without putting the ball on the ground. Plays hurt and is incredibly tough to bring down.
