It was a breakthrough in it's time, and remains fresh and engaging. Paul Desmond was the key collaborator in devising the unusual time structures, and his sax is captivating throughout the collection. With this recording Dave Brubeck's genius was discovered by the broad population as it went high up in the charts agains popular recordings. No one has ever covered the signature pieces on this album -- and couldn't. They ARE after, Brubeck, and another rendition would be flat and disappointing. The original jazz sound of a creative force.
