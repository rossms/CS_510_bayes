I'd rather be shot than go back! This place sucks! It's very sad! So much poverty. I saw a lot of panhandlers. Someone was yelling at me the whole time. Guess they didn't like tourists. The beaches are beautiful, but there is so much poverty and the younger crowd there is really rude. The older people are very friendly, but their kids are horrible and let's not forget all the disease on the streets here. Overall, I never want to go back there.
