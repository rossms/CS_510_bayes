This movie was a surprise for me. I went to see it because the story attracted me and because i wanted to see how was nicole kidman - doing something so different from satine. conclusion after seeing it: its very good, with a great story, good cast (the kids are amazing, especially the girl), and with nicole kidman showing, without a dbout, that she is a LOT more than mrs. tom cruise
