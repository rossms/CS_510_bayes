Personally, I am not a Net fan. I have to say, even, that I thought it was a blatantly horrible move for the Nets to trade such great talent in Marbury to the Suns for Kidd. However, when the Nets played the Knicks on Friday night, I saw how much he can help a team. He is averaging almost a triple double per game. Kidd is a tremendous player that can help the Nets more in that he gets the other players involved in the game more than Marbury.
