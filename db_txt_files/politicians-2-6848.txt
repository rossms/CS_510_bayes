Pigwiggle misses the point -- Strom ran against the Republicans in '48. The GOP candidate that year was Thomas Dewey -- remember, the guy who didn't beat Truman? Had Thurmond not stirred ran on a strict segregationist ticket and stayed a loyal Republican, it's likely the GOP would have won the Presidency that year. So it's really puzzling for Trent to say we supported you in '48 when a) Republicans didn't and b) Trent was, what, 7 years old?
