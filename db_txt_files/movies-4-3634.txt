heeeeeey... it really wasnt that bad... i mean keanu looked quite good with his haircut. and he is not that bad at being a bad guy, although his emotions seem to be limited sometimes. but give him a break! no one said you should be a great actor to be in an action movie! and besides be honest do u really watch those kinds of movies for acting! and all that crap about not feeling anything for the characters is just stupid! i mean i felt sorry for the homeless girl for example. its not the director's fault you cant feel... so my point through this whole thing was: DONT RATE MOVIES IF YOU DONT LIKE THEM!
