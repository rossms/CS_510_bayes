Jennifer Aniston is intriguing. She has a striking brand of beauty, but that is about all she offers. I think that while her fashion sense is impeccable, she is extremely flat in her range of emotions. This is obvious, if anyone saw her appearance on Saturday Night Live. I tuned in, hoping to find her humorous, but was let down, once again. It is strange though, because we can't help but love her! She isn't especially talented, but we can't take our eyes off of her...perhaps the perfect celebrity.
