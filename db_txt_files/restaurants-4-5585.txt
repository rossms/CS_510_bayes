When it comes to a nice hearty breakfast at a fair price, Denny's can't be beat. More than once, I've gone in there in the afternoon or evening and gotten a French Slam breakfast. I was a little disappointed that they no longer served some diner standards like open faced beef and turkey sandwiches. They seem to always be tweeking the lunch and dinner menu. Breakfast: 5 Stars. Lunch and Dinner: 3 stars. Resultant Rating: 4 Stars.
