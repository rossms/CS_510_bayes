She is the daughter of Princess Anne and Mark Philips. She is 11th in the British Order of Succession. Zara and her older brother Peter are the first grandchildren of the sovereign to carry no title. It is said that the Queen offered to create her grandchildren prince/princess under a letters patent, but this was refused by Princess Anne, who wished her children not to have any titles. She is engaged in equestrian activities most of the time and tabloid newspapers in the UK briefly dubbed her a royal rebel after she had her tongue pierced.
