I bought mine over five years ago and I don't have a single complaint with this product. The anti-shock feature eats up the batteries, but stops any potential skips. There is a switch that shuts off all of the buttons so that it won't turn on in your bag. I also recently hooked it up to my stereo because my regular CD player broke and it works great. It was also reasonably priced. I would highly recommend it.
