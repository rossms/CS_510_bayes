Can you say great sound? I have attached this CD player to speakers and it is so nice. The sound is great. You can pump it on headphones and blast yourself out. I totally enjoy any Aiwa product. My boombox was bought when Aiwa was first coming out and it is still great. I enjoy music and I enjoy buying CD players. But this is one of my favorite brands. These CD players are just so great. They are perfect for just taking timeouts discreetly.
