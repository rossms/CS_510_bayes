Great way to effectively travel the city. Only costs $1.25 and they still use tokens as well as travel cards. You can tell the infrastructure is old , yet the passenger cars are newer. Maps to describe the routes are clear and descriptive. System moves at a busy enough pace. Passenger cars are a bit awkward to travel in though because of the varied ground level at the stops. Riders are aggressive in moving thru terminals and cars. Still a great system that goes pretty much to all the areas you want to go to in the Boston area.
