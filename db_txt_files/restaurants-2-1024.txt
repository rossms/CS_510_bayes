Too expensive, food just OK. Several franchises of this chain went out of business in NYC in the past year, and that tells you something. With a huge captive market of people in a hurry who are willing to spend, NYC should have been a bellwether territory for this chain. Bellwether it was in that the people gave this outfit the cold shoulder. I actually ate in one, so I know why this happened.
