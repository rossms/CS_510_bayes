Greatest point guard to ever play. Once averaged 14 and a half assists a game, and is the only player in history to have more than one season of 1,000 assists or more (he did it SEVEN times, while a guy like Magic only managed it once). Also, amazingly, shot 57% one season -- and this was a jump shooter! Nobody saw the court like this guy, and he was an asbolut killer in a close game.
