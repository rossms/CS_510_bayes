Unfortunantly, I only got to spend an afternoon here. We accidently got off the train at the Toledo Ind. stop, which is the industrial part of town. A business lady and a local policeman, who both couldn't speak a word of English, somehow managed to get us on a bus and into the historic part of town. This incident speaks volumes about the hospitality of the town. The town has lots of history and charm. The Cathedral is absolutely beautiful. You cannot go to Spain and miss Toledo!
