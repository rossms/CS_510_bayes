madonna is the absolute bomb. she is always fresh and is an inspiration to those of us who grew up watching her evolve. a great song that quieted many who thought she'd mellowed with age! how can you not want to dance this song? she wears motherhood in a way thats sexy even to gay men, looking healthy and hot as ever and without all the plastic and airbrushing britney and christina rely on.
