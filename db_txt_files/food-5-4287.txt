Oh yeah, I remember my Bugle obsession. I didn't realize they still made them. As a kid, give me a bag of Bugles and a 2 liter bottle of Wink and I was good to go. That interesting shape and texture mixed in the with salty corn/chip treat..mmm mmm good. And if I remember correctly, they weren't greasy or messy.
