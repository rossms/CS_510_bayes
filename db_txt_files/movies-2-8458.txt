Yep, even though I did not care for the first one, I bought what many people were saying (It's even BETTER than the first one!) and rented this one too. For me better wasn't going to really take much so I figured they had a shot at it. Also, on some level, I wanted to give it another chance because I thought I really MUST have been missing something. Well, there may have been a few more laughs but they still didn't convince me this film deserved the praise and enormous success it immediately reaped. That missing something just never managed to completely reveal itself to me.
