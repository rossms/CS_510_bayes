I graduated from Hunter College in 1999 and I am now at NYU Law School. My experience as a Hunter College student was invaluable and it has made me a better person today. I am also grateful for having graduated from college debt-free. I highly recommend Hunter College to anyone who is looking for a great academic school in Manhattan for a low price!
