Only visiting QB ever to win a playoff game in Lambeau Field. I am sure everyone is going to set the standard for Vick as 0 superbowls Vick sucks. These are the same people that think only white people can play QB. Too bad the NFL is still filled with clowns that don't realize how much better a QB is if he can run a 40yd dash under 7.0 sec. Dan Marino NFL all-time leading passer was pathetic and he has 0 titles to show for his piss pore athletics and 8 wonderlic. VICK will go down as a top 5 QB ever.
