I really like the looks of this one and the size. Not to mention the speaker phone feature which normally I might think sort of obnoxious cause I hate being on speaker phone but could be really useful for calls made while driving, or possibly for business calls if two people are sharing the line. Unfortunately Nextel really isn't marketed toward the individual consumer market as much as the corporate so their prices are a bit high.
