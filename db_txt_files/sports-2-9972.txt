This is really a four-star review, but god, those ugly colors knock off about two. Who designed this, Rocawear, FUBU? Anybody have bets on how long this color scheme lasts? I hear it's like 5 years or something minimum to change it. Please, David Stern, intervene at some point...really...yuck. It's almost as bad as the old Pistons colors.
