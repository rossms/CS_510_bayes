Yay Susan - you must be doing something right to be so generally reviled...count those knee-jerk reactions! Good on you girl for standing up for what you believe in, even if it's not the popular view. Dissent is healthy, I'm not American, and it scares me how so many people get scared if anyone questions the veracity of what your government is doing. Also full of admiration for Susan's let's go braless to as many public occasions as possible stance, when so many think it's just not done for a women of her age. Haha
