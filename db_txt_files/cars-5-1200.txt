The Acura TL is a fast, taut-handling, comfortable sports sedan. It has a very strong, sophisticated engine and suspension that offers a fine balance between precise handling and a comfortable ride. The car has a relatively spacious interior filled with numerous standard features, including heated seats, vents in the back seat, a sun roof, a six-CD Bose stereo system, and audio controls in the steering wheel. I recommend the Type S over the standard TL for its superior performance.
