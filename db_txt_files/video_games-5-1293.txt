You know the game in the casino where everyone is crowded around a table, laughing, cheering, jumping around - being totally obnoxious? That's craps. Now, some of the more quiet, serious-type games are equally as exciting, but it's just not the same. If you've got a first timer with you then definetely hit up the craps table. It's intimidating to join if you don't know what you're doing but for all it's complexity, all you need to do is bet with or against the thrower. Ask the person next to you if you're totally clueless. You'll catch on quick.
