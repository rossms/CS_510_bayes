What a great city! If you're on a quest to see landmarks and historical sites and museums, then Oslo shouldn't be first on your list... but if you want to experience a different kind of European city with an interesting culture, meet genuinely friendly people, and just be generally happy with your surroundings, then Oslo is a great place to go. It's also the hub for exploring the rest of Norway, which is hands down one of the most beautiful countries I've ever been to. Takk, Norge!
