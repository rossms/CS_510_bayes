Got a 2000 Passat GLX and this vehicle is really an Audi without the all wheel drive option. It is a slick package that most people overlook when looking for a new vehicle. Drove a BMW 528 and a Lincoln LS8 before settling on this. I love to drive this car at night because of the dash lighting. The Monsoon audio system is great. If you are considering a near luxury sporting vehicle drive this. It has a real personality.
