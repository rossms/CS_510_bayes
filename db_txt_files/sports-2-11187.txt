Lloyd Carr is the consimate coach who keeps a program clean etc... He runs a nice program but is simply not a motivator or winner. In his last 6 games he is 2-4 only beating up on the MAC and losing all other games. He does not make moves quick enough, has suspect X-O talent, and does not attack with the bluechip talent he has. Upset in the last 10 years 25, yes 25 times agains the LV favorite title - he is quite simply the biggest underachiever in the nation.
