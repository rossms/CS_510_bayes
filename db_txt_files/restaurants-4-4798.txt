I love it at Red Lobster. Those cheese biscuits are terrific (except for the few times that they hurried them to the table and didn't bake them long enough!) My husband has always liked it there, however, the food seems to make him sick. I don't know if they use a lot of sulfites or what. Does anyone else have this problem there?
