Perhaps before sfalconer makes comments, he should investigate which Gino's this site is rating. If you click 'vist site' you will see what locations are being rated. Personally I have been to the Alexis road and Monroe St locations, both with buffets during the day, and quick service. The Alexis one has a full bar and other assorted Italian foods. Great food, good service, don't rate a 1 just because you don't understand which Gino's they are talking about. This is not owned by the same Gino's in Chicago, that place is called Gino's East. They serve deep dish Chicago pizza. ENJOY!
