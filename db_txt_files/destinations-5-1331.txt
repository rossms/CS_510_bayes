Ahhhh the Fatherland. A truly wonderful place to visit. Beautiful mountians, rivers, cities, musuems, beaches, castles, etc. It truly has the fairytale European feel and isn't quite as touristy as France and Italy. The food is great, and isn't just beer and knockwurst. It's actually one of the most friendly countries toward vegetarians in the western world.
