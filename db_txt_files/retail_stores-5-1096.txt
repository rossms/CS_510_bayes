Speedo has just about every type of swimming suit under the sun in stock... shorts, bikinis (for women AND men!), thongs... you name it, they probably have it! They even have clothing for working out and running. Too bad American men, in general, have such a low self-image that they have to torpedo the speedo in order to make themselves feel better. Speedos weren't invented for you couch potatoes anyway!!! Vive le bikini!
