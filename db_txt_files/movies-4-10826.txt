Add another star if you see this on DVD (due to the fact that it has more deleted scenes than any dvd I've seen). This movie was an attempt by Kevin Smith to cash in on the insanely popular duo of Jay and Silent Bob. And for the most part, it was a success. The humor feels cheap, but when it flies at you like this, you hardly care at the moment of laughter. And with surprise guests like Chris Rock, Jon Stewart, Will Ferrel, Matt Damon, and Ben Affleck, you'll be kept more than entertained.
