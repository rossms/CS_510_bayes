I was offered an auditing job that would bring me out here, and my brother went to visit because I didn't have the time. He found it to be overrated, overpriced, kinda boring and blistering. Florida communities don't seem to understand the concept of shade, or public transportation, to help people enjoy being outside. Travel guides all falsely tout these tourist traps for their own profit.
