I purchased this brand of DVD player for my boyfriend as a gift that he had been wanting. He researched and found that this was one of the better DVD players. It is awesome! He has hooked up surround sound to it and it is as if we are in the theaters watching a movie. The DVD player has not given us any problems and is so much better than VHS. I would definately buy another one as a gift for someone.
