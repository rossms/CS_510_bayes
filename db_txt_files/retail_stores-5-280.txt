update: Superior customer service (expediting, exchanging, confidentiality, etc). Catalogue is the way to go for price and selection. Bombards you with catalogues (more than one a week) and e-mail messages about sales, but in-store stuff's too expensive and selection limited. They sell more than lingerie: ugly shoes, but nice-fitting pants.
