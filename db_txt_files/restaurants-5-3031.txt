I love Baskin Robbins! The only problem is, we don't have any here in Omaha- augh! They seem to be disappearing from places I've lived, like Minnesota. I LOVE the Jamoca Almond Fudge. I always get a two-scoop sundae with lots of toppings. I also like their cones and the variety and selection of flavors. Come back, Baskin Robbins!
