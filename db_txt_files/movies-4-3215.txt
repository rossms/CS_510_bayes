Meg Ryan could sneeze into a hankie and blow me off the planet. But, I really didn't know how this movie was going to go for awhile. Ended up pretty impressive stuff. Sorta 'twanged' me at the end what happened between Meg and the special forces dude. Sorta relieved that her hubby didn't get a full eyefull of what ended up going on between her and he. Good movie afterall...!
