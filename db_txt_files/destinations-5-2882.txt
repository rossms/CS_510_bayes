I love my home, New York CIty! great people, great entertainment, great sites and just great everything. People tend to judge New Yorkers attitudes and such, but seem to forget that there are a lot of people in NYC and of course you'll find all types of people and sometimes the unpleasant people make it bad for everyone else. I love the diversity in culture, the atmosphere and the realness of my people in this great city. Go Yankees!!! I miss you all, and if I could change things I would move right back to the most biggest, wonderful and exciting place.
