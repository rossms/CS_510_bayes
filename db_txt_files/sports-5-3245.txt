His career numbers are staggering. First all-time in career homeruns, ribbies, total bases, extra base hits; second in runs; 3rd in hits; 240 stolen bases; not even in top 20 in career strikeouts. He could do it all. He is also a person who could truly empathize with what Jackie Robinson went through. Aaron was the subject of death threats and racial hatred as he chased Babe Ruth's homerun record. And, like Jackie, he was the picture of class throughout the entire process. It's good to see that he is getting back involved with MLB and that they have named a hitter's award after him.
