Burger King is very good for what it is, a fastfood place, good thing I haven't gotten fat from it. It's a fact that their burgers are of inferior quality than Wendy's, but they're better than McDonald's burgers. I like their chicken tenders. I love fries but of the big 3 the fries I like least are Burger King's.
