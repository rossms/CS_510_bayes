Recently Lay's has been touching up the potato chips a bit with a new bag, baked chips, and best of all the even crispier chips. Big deal you say? Yes, the chips are less greasy as most of us have said in the past. For those who haven't eaten any Lay's Potato Chips in a long period of time, go over to your local convenience store, buy yourself a bag of Lay's to discover this difference. Who knows, you may just eat more than just one!
