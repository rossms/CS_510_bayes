Johnny Depp makes a fantastic character. He's hilariously serious about everything. The setting is great-very gothic and beautiful. Christina Ricci is a babe! It's deliciously scary if you want it to be. And the interesting plot twists that differ from Disney's Sleepy Hollow keep you interested. Tim Burton making blatant fun of himself is great.
