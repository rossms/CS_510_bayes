Roberto Alomar is one of the most atheletic players in baseball. Few have ever been able to field as good as him. He can handle almost anything that comes his way. He has tremendous range, he can go right or left, he can throw from his knees. He can throw, with accuracy, while jumping, when both feet are in the air. And he can hit. He is great with runners in scoring position. He has good speed and is always a threat to steal. You add it all up and Robbie is a sure bet for the Hall of Fame.
