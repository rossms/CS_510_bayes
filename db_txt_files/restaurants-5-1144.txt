I know fried chicken is really artery-hardening and butt-widening, but it's so damn good!!! By far, the favorite fast food of the slobs and goons known as American Citizens. Popeye's is the best chain of this sort I've ever been to, far superior to Church's and KFC. These restaurants are supremely popular in inner city neighborhoods, and the Brothas and Sistas know a thing or two about fried chicken, believe me...
