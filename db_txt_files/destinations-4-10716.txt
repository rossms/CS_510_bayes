These are great if you like a menthol taste that is more mild. When I was a menthol smoker I smoked Salem 100's. If you are a woman or a guy who likes slim cigs you should try the Salem Slim Light 100's, they are really good- my only negative comment on the lights is that sometimes I feel they don't give me enough tobacco. These are good cigs though and the package is awesome.
