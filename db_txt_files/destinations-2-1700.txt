Northern India is pretty rough. Everyone is trying to rip you off, and it's the first country I've ever been where I could say that people were generally unfriendly. The food isn't very great and will permanently screw up your digestive system. On the flip side, India gets 5 stars for being exotic and unlike the USA. But if you want nice weather, nice people, interesting culture, and good food that won't make you sick-- head for Southeast Asia.
