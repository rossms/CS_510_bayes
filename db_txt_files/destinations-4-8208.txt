I'm not sure how safe this structure is. The elevator vibrated roughly the entire ride up, and it stopped in the middle. The restaurant at the top felt a little wobbly. But the view was great. Restaurant was pricey, so just get drinks there. And if you can ride those rides at the top, you've got a heart of stone.
