Gag me. I don't see what all the hype is about, the women's clothes aren't cute and some are poor quality. I prefer dressier clothes, like from Nordstrom, Guess, or Express, but I have bought a couple of t-shirts from Abercrombie before. The clothes are the same every year, and the colors of alot of their shirts are not very pretty (Ex. maroon, olive green, etc) This store is just too sporty and not feminine enough for me, but their clothes look good on guys.
