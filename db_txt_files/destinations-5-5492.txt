An old state, seemingly emersed in its culture- which dates back 400 years- Connecticut is both gritty and classy, without being stuck up, and it is extremely diverse. There are blue collar people from Bridgeport and Shelton mxing in with the blue bloods of Westport or Avon. There is something for everyone- What is cool is that there is a Broad minded population that refuses to judge. Cities of moderate size, great towns, forests and seahore along with an incredible abundance of arts and culture.
