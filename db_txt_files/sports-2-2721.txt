A grossly over-rated manager. A student of the Billy Martin school of management, although he is not as destructive as Martin (to his team or himself). I get the strong feeling that his act has a short shelf-life with players, and they cease buying the crap after a couple of seasons. It seemed apparent that the Mariners simply quit on him.
