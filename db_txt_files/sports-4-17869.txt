I give the extra star for heart. I have always disliked the Giants, but watching them off and on last season, I couldn't help but warm up to them. Tiki Barber is one of the hardest working and down to earth player at runningback. These guys play with more heart than anyone in the league, including the Titans. This is a blue collar team, and that's what makes them the underdog people love to cheer for.
