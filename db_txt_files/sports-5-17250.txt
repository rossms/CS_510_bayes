The Cowboys are my all-time favorite NFL team. Nowadays it hard living around mostly Redskin fans. At least we kicked their sorry butts last year. I wished that Troy had retired a little better than he did. He had a great career in Dallas and i can't help but think that his retirement could have been handled differently. Maybe that was more his fault than Dallas'. He'll be truly missed.
