P.F. Changs is a non-traditional chain store. They serve up asian fare in a chic contemporary setting. The food is great and the pricing quite reasonable for the quality of the food. Four of us had dinner and drinks for $60.00. That's tough to beat. The chinese food is out of this world. If you have one in your area, do yourself a favor and check it out!
