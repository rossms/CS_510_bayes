One of the best presidents that this nation has ever had! He lead our country through the Great Depression with the Fire Side Chats and his good leadership. He lead us to victory in WWII i don't know if that means anything to you people, but it means alot to me. My grandparents and great uncles were in that war and it would have sucked if they had died. Yeah this president did alot for our country.
