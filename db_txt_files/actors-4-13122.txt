Susan Sarandon can play a part quite well. She is always very convincing to me. And she has chosen many great movies to star in. Most of them have fit her well. I would have given her a 5 if she wouldn't have starred in that nightmare called THE ROCKY HORROR PICTURE SHOW...lol. What was she thinking?
