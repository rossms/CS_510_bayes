Henry Hyde is terrible? What are you clowns talking about? I admit, he's got the biggest, most enormous ass I've ever seen on a man, but terrible? Clinton is terrible. The Grinch is terrible. Hudson Hawk was terrible. Henry Hyde is an old man who is set in his ways. His ways, by the way, are right. Oh, I get it...you guys are mad because the Stiff didn't win. Vent away.
