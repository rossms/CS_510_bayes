I think Jim Carrey is possibly one of the most talented comedians today. In the majority of his movies, he makes me laugh from beginning to end. He deserves an Oscar if you ask me. The only reason why I gave him a 4 instead of a 5 is because of that nightmare he had to have accidentally starred in called DUMB AND DUMBER. What was he thinking? And that goes for Jeff Daniels too ! What were you guys thinking?
