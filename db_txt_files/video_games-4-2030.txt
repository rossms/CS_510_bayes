I was raised on Nintendo. I loved the first Zelda and this one blows me away. This game is the reason why I have a reserve copy of the new Zelda. Although the gameplay objectives were relatively easy, the bosses were challenging after a few encounters with them. The graphics were phenomenal and the designers put a lot of thought into producing game play objectives after you beat the game. To get a five rating the game should have been harder.
