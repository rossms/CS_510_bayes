Celestial Seasonings makes excellent teas. The variety is amazing, and there is always something new to try. The tea boxes are highly entertaining because they're covered with original artwork and interesting quotes. If you get a chance to tour Celestial Seasonings in Boulder, be sure to take advantage of it. Seeing the production process up-close is very interesting, plus you'll be treated to a very generous tea tasting at the end. It's even better if you go around the holidays because they often make special holiday brews.
