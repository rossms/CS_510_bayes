One of the clasics of course. Dostoevsky's book about a monomaniac gone crazy is psychologically and emotionally strange. He rambles on and on and it can get very wordy and sidetracked at times, but the mystery of him getting caught or not is pretty suspenseful for a book written by a Russian years ago.
