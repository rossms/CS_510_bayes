Bill Clinton is a strange politician, perhaps one of the best ever. He danced around the craven Republicans who have hounded him since he began the presidency, often without a scratch. Although I don't like how he allowed conservative Democrats to dominate the Democratic party, he has managed to keep the Right wing at bay. As for his morality, I don't care. You shouldn't either, if you have a brain of your own. I don't need someone to tell me how to act, my parents did that.
