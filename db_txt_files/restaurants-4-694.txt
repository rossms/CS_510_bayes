Blizzard and ice cream dessert treats are most deffinitly a fantastic choice at the Dairy Queen. However, the cheescake blizzard and some of the regular food, do not meet my standards as of the rest of the desserts! Plus I have to agree with one the other reviewers that Dairy Queen is one heck of a landmark in Atlanta, Ga too.
