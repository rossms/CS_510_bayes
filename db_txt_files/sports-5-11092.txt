How can you people be serious?? He has 3 SEC titles and a NT...And for those who say he does less with more and he's overrated, in the last 10 years we are second IN THE COUNTRY in wins...1) Marshall and FSU with 102 wins...2) Tennessee with 101 wins...This guy is a great coach and great recruiter...We're lucky to have him...We'll be preseason top 5 next year and likely will be in the SEC ccg.
