I haven't driven it but my cousin waited for 1 full year for his. When it did arrive I thought it would be more substantial. It is a refined vehicle but too small, looks like a mini-van on steroid. My cousin (2 adults, 2 children) are finding it doesn't carry enough gear, especially on N Cal trips for the weekend. Gets good gas mileage and is very smooth to drive. Is the price worth it??Consumer reports gives it poor ratings so you make the choice.
