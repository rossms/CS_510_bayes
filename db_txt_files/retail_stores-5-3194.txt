If your son bought a PV (previously viewed) Game.. The store ONLY gives exchanges, not refunds.. I work for Jumbo video in Davison, Michigan. Sorry to say, I'm sure that was told to you but you obviously didn't listen or remember. Which is why they said I'm only doing my job. damn right they are. You could have picked another game out or the same one to replace it with. Free of charge. I figured I'd explain to you what a exchange is. :D
