Everyone agrees that this is the best translation available. The one I was forced to read in junior high was much too opaque and unfamiliar a language to comprehend with much interest. That's pretty much how all other versions, besides the Seamus Heaney one, are. He takes liberties with the prose, but his poetic sensibilities illuminate rather than disobey the text. The oldest epic is now available in readable form. I think that's good.
