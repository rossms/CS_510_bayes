Yes... Mark Richt inherited pretty good talent from Jim Donnan -- and won an SEC championship with it. Donnan couldn't even sniff the title game in 5 years. Richt got there and won it in dominating fashion in 2. Ask Mack Brown if there's more to college football than talent. Anyone who thinks CMR is a 'flash in the pan' is misguided or a gator fan. His last 2 recruiting classes have been on par with Donnan's so he's currently inheriting some pretty good talent from himself.
