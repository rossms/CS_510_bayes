I kind of like Neve Campbell. She comes off as a little full of herself sometimes, but she did a good job all those years as good-girl Julia Salinger on Party of Five. And she broadened herself a little by playing a bad-girl delinquent in the movie Wild Things. I doubt she's going to turn into a big-time movie actress, but who knows?
