Ok I love golf but up until I read LAgal02 post I had never thought of Las Vegas as a travel destination. I cannot not believe that the city has over sixty courses. I came across this site called vegasfreedom.com. It is a great site with lots of Vegas golf info, including a section where you can order a free brochure on Vegas golf courses. Now I cannot wait to go to Las Vegas and golf. VIVA GOLF VEGAS!!
