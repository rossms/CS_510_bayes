I've worked with a number of Harvard MBAs, and for the most part, they've been the real deal. Smart, driven, hungry - even the arrogance factor (which is not just a stereotype) adds a certain swagger which is not unhelpful to success. I applied at age 23, and I doubt my application even got looked at (and that's a good thing). It's a top 3 program (wharton and stanford the other two) in my book.
