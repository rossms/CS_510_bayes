I LOVE this crap!!! It's about the only strawberry-flavored cereal around, but that's what makes it unique! How can you go wrong with the little strawberry crunch things and marshmallows that turn your milk pink! I love it! So what if it's full of sugar and processed junk, it's still good. The only problem is that is extremely hard to find in the stores- they always have Count Chocula or Boo Berry but never my beloved Franken Berry, except around Halloween because of the obvious monster theme. Tell General Mills to keep making more of it year round!!
