After 3 months of visiting 17 dealers in search of my next vehicle - I can say I am thrilled with my Toyota Highlander purchase. A bit pricey, yes. But the fit and finish, the ride, and general quality feel of the vehicle reaffirms my decision. It came down to the Highlander and the Lexus RX300. The extra room inside the Highlander sold me. Only thing I can say I wish the Highlander had was a rear glass that opens separately from the rear hatch.
