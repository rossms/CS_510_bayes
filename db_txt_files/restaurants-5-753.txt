Ice cream is great. And if you go to the right ones, the hot food is just as good. The burgers rival Wendy's, but you have to go to a Dairy Queen that uses a flame broiler. If they fry them on a flat grill they taste like cr@p. There aren't that many of them around my home, but I tend to stop by the occasional one when visiting my parents about 30 minutes away. It's best to go when they have deals for two double hamburgers for $2.00. They are served very hot and still dripping grease. Like I said, I'm fond of Wendy's, but on some days Dairy Queen burgers win hands down.
