Just one question for those of you who were doggin Tubby earlier in the year, How do you like him now???? Congrats Tubby for SEC Coach of the Year. And to all of you fair weather fans, get a life and find another team. Ashley Judd said it best UK Basketball is LIFE! If you were true fans, you would be there through thick and thin, I can't help but wonder if some of those comments had something to do with the color of his skin. In closing, GET A LIFE, UK BASKETBALL, IT'S AWESOME BABY!!!!
