I worked for about a month and then the battery started only lasting 5 hours and then i only lasted 3 so its great if you looking for a fashion statement but not if your looking for a reliable battery. Even if you look at the ipod website it shows that the battery has a limited life spand and that it depends on the ipod and the use.
