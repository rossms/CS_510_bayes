Root Beer is the best ever made drink. I always thought I was so cool because i'm drinking beer with a tad of root added to it!! If they ever made Root Beer Vanilla Root Beer as they have done to other good drinks and ruined it... i'd have to go find that strange person who likes to add vanilla to the great drinks of this century.
