This man is the creator of the American system. There migfht have been other founder fathers, and he is in my top ten list, but Madison built American Government. My rank 1.Washington-for being restrained, anyother general would ahve created an empire, i.e. Caeser and Napolean come to mind 2. Thomas Jefferson and James Madison are tied Jefferson-If you know anythign about John Locke or about Natural Rights and the Social Contract, and you read the declaration of independence, you know what a briallant man he was. Madison-Like I said built the American Government.
