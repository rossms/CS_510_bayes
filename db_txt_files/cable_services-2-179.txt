I am a new customer and have the DISH 625 DVR installed. Problem is that Caller ID on screen works about a third of the time. It sometimes works other times it doesn't. I really like this feature but if it isn't consistant what's the point? Anyone out there have any ideas on how to get it to work everytime?
