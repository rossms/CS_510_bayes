This is a courageous and good little car. I ran my 87 Sentra literally into the ground. I rarely changed the oil. I delivered pizzas. I abused it in wickedly cold and brutally hot weather. Yet this little car had virtually no problems in 8+ years of less than optimal care. To me, that is the sign of a well-engineered machine - one that can stand up to the whims and abuses of a careless owner and still deliver.
