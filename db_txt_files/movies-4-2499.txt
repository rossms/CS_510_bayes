Not a bad movie, but barely exciting for an action movie. It did set up a deeper relationship between Denzel and Dakota than is usually seen in action movies. I think a crowd that looks for explosions and sex in its action movies would be disappointed, but that a more mature audience that wants plot to go along with the high intensity of the movie would be very pleased. I think I find myself somewhere in the middle.
