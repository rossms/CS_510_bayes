A touching story about a black boxer (Ruben Hurricane Carter) who is hated purely for his colour and is sentenced to life imprisonment over something he didn't do. This movie is truely inspirational and a true-story! It shows the extremes at which racism has gone to in the past and inspires us to make a better future for ouselves and others in order for the world to be a better place. Also a brilliant perfpormance by Denzel Washington and all other actors (John Hannah). It teaches us to believe in ourselves and the innocence of others (regardless of our prejudices towards them).
