When you combine education, athletics, nightlife and overall atmosphere, very few can compete with Wisconsin. A US News and World Report Top 10 Public University year in and year out, football and basketball teams that are almost always in the Top 25 in the Nation, Sports Illustrated's #1 College Town, Playboy's #7 Party School, Money Magazine's #1 City to live in (Madison) - come on, who can claim that kind of resume? Wisconsin is a very legit school from top to bottom!
