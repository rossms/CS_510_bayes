David Lean's masterpiece film which stars Peter O'Toole who is absolutely magnificent as T.E Lawrence a British lieutenant who helps the Arabs fight against the Ottoman Turks. It is a long film, but a fascinating and deep character study on Lawrence. The supporting cast is excellent with Omar Sharif, Alec Guinness, Claude Rains, Jack Hawkins and Jose Ferrer. The cinematography is also stunning and one could make postcards out of it. A brilliant deeply layered biography of T.E Lawrence.
