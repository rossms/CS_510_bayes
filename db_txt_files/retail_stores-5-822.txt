OK, I probably shouldn't be rating this, since I'm not a male (and no..I don't wear the clothes), but everytime one of my guy friends walks in wearing a Structure shirt or jacket or whatever, I feel the need to clap. It seems that anything in Structure can very well be pictured on a guy and it'd look good. HOwever, I don't visit the store very often, but it's defintely the type of clothing that looks good.
