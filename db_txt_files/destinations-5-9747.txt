I gave it a 5 just because of the stroy i have to tell about them first of all im 15, and i had heard from a friend that these gave a pretty good buzz and had ok flavour, so i asked the indian clerk for a loosie if he had an open pack and he laughed in my face, "haha you want a wEEENston, i only know one old guy who smokes dose". That was funny enough, embarrassing yet still d: p. Then my friend had 55 cents to buy a pack of violet mints and he asks him if he could get them for 55 cents, and he goes to him "what are you his brodder?" It was so hilarious. THIS is why smoking is good, the memories d: D
