This has a light, sweet taste that's almost reminiscent of honeydew melon. Containing only white tea, fructose crystals, organic ginger, and citric acid, a 16 oz bottle has only 56 calories! This not only tastes great, but it's refreshing & satisfying and has the most health benefits of any kind of tea!
