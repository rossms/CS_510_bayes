The Skins are playing their best football going into the playoffs, and having destroyed Detroit, it is not unrealistic to think they could handle Tampa Bay and (dare I say) go to the Show. With the #2 pick for next year (probably Lavar Arrington) and a bunch of other high draft choices, things look promising for a return to the glory days of the 80s.
