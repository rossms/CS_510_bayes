SPECIAL THANKS TO PBEAVER for identifying the Franciscus movie title I was looking for! I really appreciate it. Now about James Dean...not my all-time favorite, but I do think he was quite a good actor. And I made it a point to visit his grave last year and take some pictures of his old high school, during a visit to Fairmount, Indiana.
