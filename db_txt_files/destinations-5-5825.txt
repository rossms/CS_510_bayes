Great state to visit and maybe live. If you move to Wisconsin the only place worth living in is Madison. Unless you like small towns and farms. It's a little cold but the summers are great here. Probably the best state to live in the midwest with the exception of Illinois, since Il. has my favorite city of all time---Chicago!!!
