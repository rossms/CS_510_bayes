I've really enjoyed my Yamaha, it's quick and nimble, 600cc with plenty of power. Weighing in at about 400 lbs. it's a solid ride but not a monster that you can't manuever around town at slow speeds. Stable on the highway (though I'm not a big highway fan) and a real pleasure to ride through the backroads. In a nut shell it's well engineered, runs well, low maitenance and more power and speed than I'll ever need. If you want a total crotch rocket then this probably isn't your bike but if you want a nice ride that's still faster than any car on the road then this is a good choice.
