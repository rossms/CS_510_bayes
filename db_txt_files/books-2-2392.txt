I don't think there's anything to 'get' - like conceptual or abstract art, it's nothing but smoke and mirrors to cover a basic dearth of ideas. Sometimes there is a suggestion of something exciting - a homage to America's past or to an idealized, Norman Rockwell present. But really, how many talking signs or statues can you take? How many diner counters can you watch? That said, the drawing is decent imho.
