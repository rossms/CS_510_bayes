My husband and I used to frequent the Ashland, KY location, but the service has gone way downhill. On our last visit, the waitress failed to offer us refills on our drinks the entire time we were there. The food is mediocre. The breakfast, though, is pretty good, but I'm not a breakfast kinda person.
