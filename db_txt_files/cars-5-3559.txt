The Lincoln Navigator is the best vehicle Ive ever been in. It has much much more features than the Esacalde available. Very comfortable on warm, heated seats. My uncle has a 00' and its just great! There have been no problems at all. It has a class leading 3rd row seat. Big and powerful, people just feel safer in SUV's.
