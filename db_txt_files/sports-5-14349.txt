Absolutely the best QB that history has ever seen. Afterall, he does hold the all time record of most touchdowns in a single season. Several players have tried to break his record, such as Brett Favre and Peyton Manning (Manning probally will break the record at the end of the season but hasnt yet), but didnt get it done.
