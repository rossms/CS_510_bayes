Mcdonalds is a good restaurant because they offer meals for a low price. I dont think that people who are fat should complain about mcdonalds because it was their choice to eat there. the restaurant has never put a gun to anyone's head and forced anyone to go there. if you dont like it, then dont go there. if you want to lose weight, then dont go there. if you dont like their food then, dont go there. its that simple.
