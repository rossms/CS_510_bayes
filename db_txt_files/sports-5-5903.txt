Ok Ok, so Duke lost, but why do people here make it seem like it was Redicks fault? And for u Salim Stoudemire lovers out there, way to go against my home state's U of I! If only you didn't suck you guys might've won.. his clutch shot the game before was a fluke. ILUVSEANMAY, if you'r a guy you gotta be 3 times as gay as redick (psh and please... makes you sound like a junior high school girl).. Fighting Illini are gonna embarass you. 1 more thing - #1JohnDoeFan - WOW, That coulda been the gayest comment ever left on this site, way to try and be funny.
