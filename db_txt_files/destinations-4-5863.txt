The state has huge urban cores around New York and Philly that are crowded, with lots of traffic and industry that 'smell'. Costs around the NYC area are very high-less so near Trenton and Philly. Cape May and the southern part of the state along with the Atlantic beaches are very nice.Lots of history, urbane and spohisticated.
