Several times a year I'll treat myself to a pack of old standard non filter cigarettes and Camel is my choice. Not as dry tasting as Lucky Strike and I have found that if I only smoke about 2/3 of the cigarette the flavor and smoothness remain pretty even. Once the cigarette begins to get small it overheats and becomes harsh. A pot of Columbian Supreme coffee and a fresh pack of Camels is one of my favorite indulgences.(second only to Mallowmar cookies for me and a tank full of Amoco Premium fuel for the car)
