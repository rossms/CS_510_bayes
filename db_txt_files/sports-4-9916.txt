04 is WOLVES year. they may not win championship that year, but it's just a tremendous achievement for the franchise: KG won allstars MVP in previous year, then regular season MVP in the next year; now we start seeing KG on the rise (not just individually) but as well as the team. with current roster, get used to WOLVES in PLAYOFFS now
