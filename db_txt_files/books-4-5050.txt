Altas Shrugged by Ayn Rand is an interesting and complelling exploration of the goods and evils of individualism. The characters are intriguing and the concepts provoking. However, this book is not recommended as a light read. It is long, dense, and can be overwhelming. Worth reading if you have the time to commit.
