Saturday Night Fever is an extremly trashy, rotten musical that stars John Travolta as a young dancer, who lives with a totally eccentric family, and one day decides to leave home, and becomes a famous dancer at a local nightclub. The only thing worth watching in this movie is a few good dance numbers, and that's about all. There's also an early appearence by Fran Drescher.
