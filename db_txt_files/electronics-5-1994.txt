Anyone who says that gamecube sucks should get their head out of their a$$. Even if the games are targeted to people under 17 years, they're still better than most other games out there. The system's perfect for people who just want to have fun, not for the losers who have no life other than video games. YOU KNOW WHO YOU ARE!!!!!
