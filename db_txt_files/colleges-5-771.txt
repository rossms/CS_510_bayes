After reading the other 20 or so comments, it seems either you like it or you don't. Personally, I found the format very flexable and perfect for individuals with a full-time job, spouse, and children. I have had 2 or 3 questionable instructors during the completion of my degree, but had similar experiences with traditional schools as well. Some course do provide more than one section/instructor.
