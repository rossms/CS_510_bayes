I think it s a great town. But to get your own point of view, I think you should have at least been here once. I mean, the aveny is somthing you have to see with your own eyes. I grew up here, almost my intire childhood, but I m not going to spend the rest of my life here. I think that the people in Goteborg should see more of the world, or else you might get a little naiv. Cause we here in Sweden has a very high standard, and so has Goteborg, and you might wanna see other countries. And their cultures. Since the swedish way of life is very similar to the american.
