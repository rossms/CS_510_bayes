This is one of the few decent commercial cigarettes out there for anyone who seeks a mild and smooth smoke. Tobacco quality is very consistant pack to pack. Unlike most lights, these are actually a pleasurable experience due to the non-harshness and good taste. These are much better than Marlboro Lights too for those wondering who to believe. Camel Lights and American Spirit Lights are my 2 favorite choices of cigarettes. Personal disclosure: I smoke about 7-8 cigarettes a day.
