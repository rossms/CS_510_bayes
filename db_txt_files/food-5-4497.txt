SUCH a good flavor if you get a good one! But, I find it hard to find a good brand that is consistant, usually, if I got into a store that is taste testing the gouda, and it is wonderfully flavorful, I will buy it on the spot, but hard to get the same brand twice it seems since it is usually imported.
