I was so surprised when I went and visited Tennessee. I had never been to that part of the country before and I was surprised to see how beautiful it was. I thought that it was going to be flat and ugly. I thought that the people would have the stereotypical attitude of the South but I couldn't have been more wrong. The state was so pretty. I went in the fall and I have never seen so many different shades of red, orange, yellow and brown. There is a river that runs right through that is beautiful. The people are so friendly and open. It blew my expectations away.
