I currently use Sprint long distance. The Foncard has decent rates within the United States and is always helpful when I am away from my own phone. The home long distance rates are good as well, competing with the other major companies for long rates. Six cents per minute within California\U.S. and ten cents a minute to Canada are good rates. Plus, I enjoy the fact that I can accumulate frequent flyer miles since Sprint is partners with Northwest Airlines.
