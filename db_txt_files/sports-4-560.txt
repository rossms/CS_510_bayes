A very good shortstop, excellent situational hitter. Has enjoyed lots of success due to playing for the yankees. BUT he is NOT the best player in the majors. He is not even the best SS in the majors (AROD, Tejada etc..) . Overhyped by the Yankees media machine. Off the field an excellent example of how a player should act.
