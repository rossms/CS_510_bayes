Go Bush Go! Finally a man that is honest and trust worthy which is something his opponent has no concept of. I just wish that the Democrats that are supporting the tree hugger would shut up whinning, accept their defeat gracefully and give the presidency to the man who won it fair and square GEORGE W BUSH!! MR BUSH....North Carolina is behind you all the way to the White House...Clinton/Gore hit the highway! Go Rush Limbaugh Go!
