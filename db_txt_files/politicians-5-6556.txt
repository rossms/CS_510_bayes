I give this courageous, decent man a five-star rating because of his politics and also because he has chosen to go forward and continue living his life the way his constituents and the country would want him to. For someone who had anthrax aimed at him, I say what kind of sick human being would target him, Pataki and others like Daschle, who want what's best for this nation? Daschle is a man with a conscience, and a true patriot who believes in the inherent good of this nation.
