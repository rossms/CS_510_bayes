I bought a 2000 Kia Sephia at the end of December, 1999. My wife uses it to run a paper route, and we told this to the sales people, and they saw no problem. The brakes wore out at 6000 miles. They said the rotors were defective, and they replaced them under warranty. The same thing happened at 8000 miles, but then the service manager said they would not replace the brakes any more under warranty because it was not normal use.
