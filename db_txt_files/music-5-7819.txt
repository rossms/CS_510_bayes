Here is another great Weird Al Video. I believe this is first true parody video because his previous videos may be parody song but this was the first to actualy made a video like the original one. The Real differrence of this video is that Al's Guys have forks and spoons and Michael's guys had knives and blades.... It had the same message though...Don't fight just leave each other alone and make peace..That is how I got it....
