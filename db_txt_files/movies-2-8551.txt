I hate this movie. So cliche, so cliche. It also reinforces gender roles and undermines those fighting for the abolishment of confining gender roles in a word where women can do what men can and where transgendered and transsexuals face harsh discrimination. This movie, and America's adoration of it, represent a step in the WRONG direction. What do you think of that?
