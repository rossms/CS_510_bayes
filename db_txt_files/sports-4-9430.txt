I'm struggling to decide how valuable Mutumbo is to a team. Clearly he makes a huge difference on the defensive end. He blocks shots, changes shots, and grabs a whole lot of rebounds. But he's stiff and awkward on offense. And, unlike other premiere big men (Mourning, O'Neal, Wallace), he rarely seems to take over a game. Maybe his defense alone is worth five stars, but he'd be a much more impressive player if he could hurt you at both ends of the court.
