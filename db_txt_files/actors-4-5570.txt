Great work as Bond. He's helped liven up James Bond when the Bond Franchise has become run of the mill action-adventure stuff. I like that he isnt allowing himself to be pidgeonholed as Bond, he's taken on other roles - Mars Attacks, The Thomas Crown Affair, After the Sunset. Good actor who should play a bad guy more often.
