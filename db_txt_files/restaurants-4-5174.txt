I recently went to Applebee's and it was exactly what I thought. It is the same as TGIF's or Chili's. They are great chain restaurants. Applebee's had tons of choices from ribs to wraps. They had a pretty large selection of low-fat plates that even supplied the nutrition information. They constantly refill your soda. The appetizers are great too from cheese sticks, to wings, to spiniach dip. Anyone can find something that they'll like.
