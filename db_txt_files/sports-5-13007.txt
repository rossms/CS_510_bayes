Though not as good as expected, the Wolfpack defense is the reason this team has a winning record. With rush ends Manny Lawson and Mario Williams, along with linebacker Stephen Tulloch, the Wolfpack was third in the league in pass efficiency defense, fifth in total defense. The group led the league in sacks with 36. The offense made little gain with a new quarterback. Jay Davis was benched in favor of Marcus Stone, but neither could get this offense moving on a consistent basis. The Wolfpack ranked 11th in the ACC in first downs obtained, last in third-down conversions, 10th in total offense.
