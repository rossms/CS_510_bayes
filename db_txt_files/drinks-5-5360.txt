I have always liked Mountain Dew.I like the level of carbonation and have never had a problem with caffeine.Basically you can drink it straight from the can or bottle without burping your head off.I can't say that I like any other version of Mountain Dew beyond regular.Diet,like all diet drinks,sucks and the others like Code Red etc all pretty much suck too.As a sufferer of a sensitive stomach I find it easy on the digestion also.
