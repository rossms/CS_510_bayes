I lived in Cuenca, Ecuador for just under 2 years, it was the most amazing experience. The city is absolutly amazing, with both old and new parts creating a wonderful diversity of cutlure and growth. The people are great, completely excepting and caring. I feel like I could go back now after 7 years of not living there and still feel like its home. I would recommend everyone visit Cuenca at least once in their lifetime!!!
