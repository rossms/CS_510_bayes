How can so many people rate this team so low? Like, gee they must suck. They only had something like 5 shutouts en route to a Super Bowl championship, and pretty much terrorized all offenses during the regular season. They're not my favourite, but I have to respect them. They have not let go of any important players (Dilfer is getting old anyways). Wouldn't be surprised to see them again in the Super Bowl.
