Clean. Some nice designs inside. Lousy food. Nice shops although limited in variety. Lots of books. Not good for huge crowds. Sunny. Sometimes too hot. Easy for planes - not so for cars. Lot of space to get alone and sit. Overhead TV at gates play CNN too loud, too long: Ted Turner has bribed airports and he, plus airport mgrs, should be executed. Overall adequate - slow paced and nothing hard about it.
