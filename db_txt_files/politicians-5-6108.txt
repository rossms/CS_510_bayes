John Ashcroft- what a hero, putting up with all this b. S. just because he doesn't believe in killing babies before they are even born and supposedly being a racist. And besides, everyone has a right to an opinion, just because he believes in conservative ideals doesn't mean he won't enforce existing laws that go against his ideas. Democrats say he is a hardcore religious man and too religious for the country. Hmm... Racist and being a hardcore religious, Christian man at the same time- Democrats are so good at coming up with these perfectly matching combinations.
