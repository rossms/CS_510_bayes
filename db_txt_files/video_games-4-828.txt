This game was actually pretty cool, and I enjoyed it until one summer day in 1979 when my brother yelled out NAZI!!!!!! one day just to be cute and it sent the next-door neighbor kid, who was of the Jewish faith, home crying. My mother really raked him over the coals for that dumb remark and I was so horrified I never touched it again for 21 years. Still, one bad memory does not a bad game make. It's great fun, and it's one of the few games my wife and I enjoy playing together.
