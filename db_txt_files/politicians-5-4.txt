The worst mistake this poor woman ever made was getting involved with Prince Chuck. She was the best thing that happened to him and to the Royal family and they used her, then tossed her a side. She was not prepared for the life that she was thrown into and never really fit in. If all royality were like this late Princess there would be many more monarchies then there are today. She truely was a Princess that the world had not seen in a long time and probably never will again.
