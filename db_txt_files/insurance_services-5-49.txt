Progressive may not be the cheapest but they are the best! I had good coverage, had a wreck and just had to drop my car off at they're repair facility. A rental car was waiting for me and they called me when my car was ready it was hassle free. Also, they wont drop you because you have had an accident like State Farm! Web site is great too!
