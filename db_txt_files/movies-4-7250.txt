Having two funny guys in the same movie doesn't always work, but this one does. This has one of my all time favorite comedy scenes in it. When they are in bed together and Steve Martin asks John Candy where his hand is and he says between two pillows and Martin says Those Aren't Pillows! It's absolutely hilarious. Also, when they are going down the one way road the wrong way, and they think everybody is just waving at them to say hello.
