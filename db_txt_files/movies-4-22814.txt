I was a bit hesitant to rent this movie and even more hesitant to watch it because of all the publicity it got (I hate it when movies manage to abuse the amount of attention it can possibly get) but I ended up liking it. Perhaps it was the character Snape that intrigued me the most because he was the most mysterious of them all and mystery is an attractive thing (so is Alan Rickman). Ugly with hediously greasy hair? I think not. I had to keep on rewinding his scenes. I really hope I see more of him in the next films. Too bad the story circles around Harry Potter rather than him.
