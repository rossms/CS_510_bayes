I give Boston Market four stars because it is so much better than its corporate sister (McDonalds) Decent meatloaf. Good chicken. But those new potatoes are simply outstanding. Sweet corn is easy, but theirs is among the best. All the pop you can drink. Real butter available without having to ask is a BIG plus. Cornbread is not bad, either.
