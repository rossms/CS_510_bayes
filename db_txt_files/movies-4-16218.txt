I didnt have very high expectations since I hadnt heard much about the movie..so I was pleasantly surprised. I thought Bruce Willis and Samuel L. Jackson were excellent. I was glued to my seat the entire time..however towards the end I had to roll my eyes a bit..it got to be bit too much. Also, I did figure out the ending..not that it was overly predictable..but it didnt take too much brain power. Overall, I was intrigued by the concept of good vs. evil, the hero villian relationship etc...It was a very interesting story line played out by excellent acting and great effects.
