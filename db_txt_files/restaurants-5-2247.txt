At 3am, after a long night of drinking, there are few things better than some sliders from Whiteys. Get a 10 sack, some chicken rings (best not to think too hard about what part of the chicken they are), and some cheese fries...see how many friends you make. It's not the healthiest food in the world, it may make you pay the next day (so does beer), but there's just something about them. And if you can't find the closest one you can call 1-800-THE-CRAVE twenty four hours a day to talk with someone deals with drunk idiots for a living.
