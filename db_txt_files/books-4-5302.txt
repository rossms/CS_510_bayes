I am 17 years old and some may feel that i know nothing about life but The Lovely Bones depicts it. After such a tragic death you cry, you suffer, and you heal. At times it may have seemed sentimental but damn it Susie deserves it and so do all the other women out there who have suffered and even died the way she did. People need happy endings and i thank Alice Sebold for giving her main character one.
