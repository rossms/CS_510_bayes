I have held accounts for 2 years. Have been pretty happy so far. I ran into some problems with accounts & customer service was relatively easy to reach and was reasonable in resolving the issues. They did not completely go out of way to resolve the issues - but issues got resolved in timely fashion (that's why I give 4* instead of 5*)
