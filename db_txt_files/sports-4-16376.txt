Ignore one missed 46 yard field goal and he's one of the best kickers in the NFL. His season long was just 48 yards, so that should tell you it's not about choking. It's a difficult kick in the first place. During the regular season he was 23 of 25 and only missed one kick over 40, and that is what I call impressive.
