This is one of the biggest museums you will ever see in your life. They have everything from ancient Egyptian treasures to rocks from Mars. The museum is really quite interesting, but it is so enormous that it is impossible to walk around it in even a whole day. That is why I gave it a 4 rating, since they fit everything into this place.
