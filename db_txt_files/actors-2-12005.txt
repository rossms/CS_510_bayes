Has a TERRIBLE British accent. I cringe every time she uses it and I can't understand why she had so many film offers which asked her to do it. Although, much worse than that is her irritating vally-girl accent which she uses in every other damn movie. Her acting is medicore mostly but she does shine sometimes, albiet, very rarely. She has a beautifully refined face (when she doesn't open her mouth to speak) but her body is something yet to be desired; she needs to maintain some curves. If she was ever any good before, she's certainly become a wash-out now.
