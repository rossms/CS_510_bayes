can anyone here explain to me why the best player in the eastern conference is ranked number 39 behind jokes like Anfernee Hardaway, Damon Stoudamire, Jason Williams, Sam Cassell and Allan Houston, and just in fron of Theo Ratliff? ABSOULTELY RIDICUOLOUS!! Hmmm, seems to me Sixers, Pistons and Nets fans are a little bitter of him destroying them in the playoffs last year. The refs handed the Nets the series last year because the NBA wanted to see a Nets Lakers matchup in the finals. he's the best fourth quarter player in the game, and deserves to be in the top 10, if not the top 5.
