I am currently enrolled in UOP and really enjoy it! The classes aren't boring and they don't feel like they go on for ever as they do in a regular university. The instructors are intelligent and the advisors are extremely helpful. It is very challenging and requires a lot of self discipline. You are asked to write papers, which clearly show your knowledge of the subject, rather than taking a test, which shows only your memorization skills. The group work is a good parallel to life, things are not always equal and sometimes you have to work and put forth more effort. I highly recommend this school!
