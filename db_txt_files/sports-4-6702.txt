What a great guy. The Blazers don't deserve him. He was a rookie coach he took what he could get. He is still learning but what a class act. If he has any problem its that he is too nice. He will be a better coach somewhere else and when he is gone people will be amazed how he kept the whiny selfish blazers together in the first place. We focus on the negative but when he helped that girl with the national anthem that was probably one of my personal top 5 sports moments ever.
