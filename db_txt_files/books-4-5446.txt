She's Come Undone suprised me. I had certainly not expected it to be like this. It tells the story of Dolores Price, a girl growing up in the 50's/60's and we follow her very, very sad life from age 4 to age 40. There are quite a few 'speed-bumps' along the way and more than a few times I had to put the book down, too embarrased by her struggles to continue. But once the author really got into it the chapters flew by. I saw a lot of myself in Dolores, the earlier Dolores that is. It's a great book, but it's not really something you should read to get your spirits up.
