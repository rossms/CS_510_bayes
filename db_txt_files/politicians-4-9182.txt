While he was not a flawless man, didn't win any major war, never provided the nation with a large tax cut, and was not our most charismatic leader, he did support the fundamental values of liberty and patriotism. He helped prevent tax increases, stood against his own party on the tarriff issue, and defended the Constitution of the United States. One of our finer leaders.
