While I still love the 1990-96 300ZX (R.I.P), the biggest screw up ever by Nissan was their decision to discontinue this fine looking performance machine. If they introduced the last off the line '96 300 ZX as a 2001 model I bet it would still turn heads everywhere. The 300ZX oozes with sex appeal! Oh yeah, did I mention the Z's twin turbo DOHC engine that'll smoke any Mustang? The 300 ZX along with the Acura NSX remains the epitome of Japanese sports car performance and ingenuity.
