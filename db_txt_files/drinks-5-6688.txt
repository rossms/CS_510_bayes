Still the best. Amazingly enough none of the other sports drinks, all produced by huge soft drink companies, can compete with Gatorade. I often drink this just as a beverage of choice not just as an activity supplement. It's not too sweet so you don't feel like your drinking syrup, and it has a nice light flavor. Just one thing though..what ever happened to Gatorade Gum?? I bought a total knock off of it calle Quench Gum or some such thing and it was an awful substitute.
