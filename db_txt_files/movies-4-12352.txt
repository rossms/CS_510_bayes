I was prepared to view with a jaundiced eye because the 1968 version with Gene Wilder, Zero Mostel as Max Bialystock, and others was so good. I have to admit that I was pleasantly suprised. I suppose that Mel Brooks was able to hold it together. He was the screen writer on the 2005 edition and directed the 1968 edition. He also produced it on Broadway, as I understand, although I have not seen it on Broadway. I recommend the 2005 "Producers" as a worthy film.
