Although this is not the first bike I have ever ridden, it is the first bike I have ever owned and I am not sorry about it at all. This is definately the best quad on the market. I have a White Bros. slip on pipe, K&N air filter, and it has been re-jetted and it has a great holeshot, even greater top end, and most of all it is very reliable. This is just an all around good bike.
