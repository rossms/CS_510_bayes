I don't know about falling in love with anyone you don't really know but... Mr. Fraser is a really good actor. I can hardly wait to see what roles he takes on in future. He has true ability and his future is secure. I don't see any of his movies as being a flop or embarrasing... These films only go to prove the extent of his ability.
