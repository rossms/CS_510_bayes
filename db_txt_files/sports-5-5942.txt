To all the retarded people who hate J.J. Redick, GROW UP. The only reason why you hate him is because he skools ur team's asses in games. You people wish you had a J.J. Redick on your team. Thats why you people are haten on him. Cuz you are JEALOUS!!! Honestly, how can you not say he's great. J.J., Ewing, Williams have carried the team. J.J is the one that Duke looks to in big games. And when he shoots that three in your face to win the game, I LAUGH MY ASS OFF. Like i said b4, YOU ARE JEALOUS.
