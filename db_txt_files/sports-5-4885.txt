What's not to like about the guy? He's polite, doesn't sweat, doesn't give one finger salutes to opponents' fans in their house, doesn't curse at his bench when a guy on the court makes a mistake. Plus his ability to turn big men into point guards is unmatched. The man is everything you ask for in a coach.
