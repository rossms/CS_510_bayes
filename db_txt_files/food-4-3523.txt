Good tasting girl scout cookies. A combination of coconut chocolate and caramel with a nice crunchy middle. the only thing I do not like is for what you pay you get so few of the cookies. and it seems like they give less in the box each year. If it were not it was for a good cause i probably would not want to buy them considering the small amount of cookies I get.
