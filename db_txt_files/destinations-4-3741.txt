I lived in Austin for eight years and I must say it has got to be one of the most unique cities in the US. The people are cool, hip , and educated. If you live central, you can actually forgo a car. The summers are unbearably hot and humid and people suffer from allergies sometimes. But this town has it all...laid back cowboys, yuppies, techies, college kids, great night life, world class libraries and universities and it is in Texas so there is a lot of diversity. Enjoy y'all!
