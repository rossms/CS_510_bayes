I enjoyed their first album more because of it's raw energy, but this album is immortal. For one, it contains Stairway to Heaven which is universally loved and hated at the same time. Where else can you get a seven minute ballad with no chorus on the radio? Other songs like, When the Levee Breaks and Goin' to California show the band as mature musicians at the height of their creativity.
