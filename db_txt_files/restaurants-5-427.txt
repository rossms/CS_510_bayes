Quality food and service, that's the Wendy's formula for success. Lets see, what made this Ohio based chain the success it has become over the past 30+ years? Oh yeah, the burgers were never frozen before cooking, fries are not too salty, prices are not too high, and there's the salad bar for the rest of y'all. One thing that made Wendy's world renowned was for their excellent advertising, especially the ones that included the great Dave Thomas. Wendy's just continues to get better every year, as their It's Better Here! slogan suggests.
