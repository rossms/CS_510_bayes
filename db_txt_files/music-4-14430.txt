I think that this is a very daring idea for a soundtrack, but it is pulled off so well! Nicole Kidman can sing better than I'll ever hope to be able to and the songs are really fun. Sparkling Diamonds, Elephant Love Medley, Hindi Sad Diamonds, and Lady Marmelade are the best tracks in my opinion, but they are all really fun! I haven't even seen the movie yet, but after hearing this, I'll make sure to rent it when it comes on video.
