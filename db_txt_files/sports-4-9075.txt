He's back! Grant is a good guy and he has surprised everyone by coming back from 5 ankle surguries over 4 years. Just happy to see him playing again and hope he can finish out his career on a healthy note. Not quite the player he was when with the Pistons, but still can play and gets credit for coming back.
