Beautiful architecture on par with any European city. Ignore the goofy tourist books; it is't Colonial Williamsburg, it's a big, modern, urban city. That means it's very crowded, hectic and auto traffic is a nightmare. On the plus side it has a very low crime rate for such a large city, much lower than cities like Atlanta, Miami, Houston, Washington DC, etc. Nightlife and other attractions are first rate. People are typical big city people: abrupt and business like, no different than NY, Chicago, London, Paris, etc., if you can't hack this, you shouldn't live or visit big, busy cities.
