Like most chains, it's not particularly good and not particularly bad and if you don't have a good coupon they're very overpriced for what it is. When ordering PH I stick with the Big New Yorker which I think is a really great pizza and a great deal too. I also like their stuffed crust and enjoyed the occasional golden crust when they had it. I go elsewhere for deep dish/hand tossed/thin crusts.
