Given the clientele that comes to Destin Beach, this beach is shockingly beautiful when clean. White powder sand beaches set against the calm clear waters of the Gulf. If you are lucky you will see porpoises jumping out of the water. Unless you are looking for redneck spring break central, don't come here during March or April.
