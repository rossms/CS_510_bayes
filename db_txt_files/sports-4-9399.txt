I remember going to watch a Michigan State / Villanova NIT game a bunch of years ago, and this guy named Steve Smith, with very little fanfare, came out and scored 40 against the 'cats, and won the game almost singlehandedly. Ever since that day I have appreciated this guy's skills. It's also somthing that he donated $1M to his college - how many athletes do that?
