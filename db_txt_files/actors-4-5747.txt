Jeremy Northam, you know Mr. Knightly in Emma . Oh ya, that's him. Jeremy Northam was great in that role. I'd be happy if he just stayed in those period roles forever. He was also good in Posession but I didn't like the film as a whole (very dull). Again, Northam and Gwynneth (what's up with that?). I'd like to see him in more films, it remains to be seen if he has staying power or not. If he's gonna bust a move he'd better do it quick though. He's falling far behind his rivals Colin Firth and Hugh Grant in the handsome, mannered, middle-aged Brit. roles that they are all so well suited for.
