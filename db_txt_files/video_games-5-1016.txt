Great game. Why? Great pictures, easy rules. As a kid, I actually enjoyed sliding down the chutes...that always seemed more fun, even though it set you back....my spouse, not a native speaker of english, found the game great for its simplicity and fun. Plus, you don't have to worry about a bunch of rules....just spin and go. For the price, few games are better.
