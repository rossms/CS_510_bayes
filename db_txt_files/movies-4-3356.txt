Cho Yun Fat is amazing, but I didn't like the Jackie Chon style. It was too much. If you're into those wierd old Kung-Fu type movies only on late at night on Sundays, where the hero jumps 80 ft. up before cutting a guy in half with his foot, you'll love it. Action and plot are John Woo style and it's a good film.
