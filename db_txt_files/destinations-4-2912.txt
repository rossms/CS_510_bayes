It is our biggest city, and probably our best city. The only reason i don't give it 5 stars is because it is sucking all of the money and many of the people out of upstate ny. The suburban sprawl of NYC is getting bigger and bigger, it has actually spread into upstate ny now (orange county) There are other great cities in new york too, that would have a chance to really get going again, if all of the states money didn't go to NYC.
