I truly believe he is a good actor but there are times where I find myself being entertained more by the supporting actors in his films. Like in Gladiator(Joaquin Phoenix), The Insider( Gary Oldman), and Master & Commander (Paul Bettany). He was brilliant in A Beautiful Mind and I was sorry to not see him receive the Oscar for that. But he has portrayed strength superbly and then turned around and portrayed weakness to perfection.
