Well of course Nebraska is boring if you jsut see what is visible from the Interstate! Visit western Nebraska; it is like a whole other planet. So natural, so quiet and relaxing, and nobody around for miles at times! But if you're looking for big action, don't go here; the cities are very boring. The panhandle is good for camping; otherwise, not a vacation spot.
