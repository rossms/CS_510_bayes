Maggiano's is the better of the two major family-style Italian chains as far as food and decor are concerned (Buca di Beppo being the other). Keep in mind that family-style means huge platters meant to be shared around the table, so my 5-star rating only applies to groups of 5 or more. For big, hungry groups in the mood for Italian and a fun (read: loud) atmosphere, Maggiano's is hard to beat.
