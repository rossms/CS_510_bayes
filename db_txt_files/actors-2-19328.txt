I don't understand why Matt LeBlancs character was so popular on the show. Joey was too dimensional to be true. And Matt's acting skills are just not good enough in my eyes to fill that gap. I've seen him in movies before and it just confirmed my opinion. He is an below average actor who can just portray certain kinds of characters.
