Their stuff is ridiculously overpriced! I went to Borders today so I could look for a new CD. I ended up not buying one. A lot of the CD's were at least $18.99 and up. I think better deals on books and CD's can be found at garage sales, my hometown's flea market, Half Price Books, CD Warehouse, and even on eBay. Also I found a book at Borders that was a softcover and it was $19.99! That's usually the price of a hardcover. To all Borders stores: You could have more of my business if you lower your prices!
