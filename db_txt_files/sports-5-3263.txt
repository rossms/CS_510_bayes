A stalwart to a degree that other players aren't expected to reach. The 56 game hitting streak will never be broken. I admire him as he had a heavy burden. He was the best the Yankees had for so long that it reached a point later in his career where he simply could not have stepped out of the captaincy or the number four slot, ride the pine a bit and enjoy his golden baseball years. He had to be more than a human playing the game, no one (especially himself) could have seen him in any lesser of a role.
