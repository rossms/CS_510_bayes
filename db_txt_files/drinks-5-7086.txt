I do not see any faults with this vodka as it is exactly what I would expect from a high end bottle. It blends terrifically with any mixer and you can make some kick ass white russians with it! Strong enough to know your drinking a good vodka, but ultra smooth so there is no unnecessary burn or gag....awesome stuff!
