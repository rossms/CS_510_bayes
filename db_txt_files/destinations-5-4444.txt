Despite the fact that Iowa is a pretty boring state, I have nothing bad to state about Des Moines Iowa. It is a pretty modern city for a city stuck in an agrarian state, and for a city of 200,000 people, it has a pretty impressive skyline. This is pretty much the business center of the state of Iowa.
