This is my favorite Girl Scout Cookie. I remember selling it in the 60's, and it was my favorite then (although I don't remember the name being the same). I guess that is why I sold more of them than any other Girl Scout Cookie. Now, I am a troop leader, and Do Si Dos remain one of our best sellers.
