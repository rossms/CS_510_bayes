While I'm happy with some of his decisions (i.e. Ashcroft, executive order restricting funding of pro-abortionists overseas, etc.) I'm concerned by all the New World Order/One Worlders he's gathered around him. Time will tell. P.S. Regarding the comment made by SClark about Bush's destroying our democracy : we don't live in a demcracy. America is a REPUBLIC! Why don't you crack open one of your history books. Democracy is one of the worst forms of government on the face of the earth, as it is subject to the momentary whims of a razor thin majority. Nothing more than mob rule.
