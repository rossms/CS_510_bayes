Hands down the best program in the country. Year in and year out, FSU is battling for the national championship. No other program in the country has had the success that the Noles have had over the last 10-15 years. If memory serves me, they've been in the top 5 (or maybe top 3) each year since like 1990 or something. In addition, if you were to team up current NFL players by what school they went to, FSU would have the best team by far.
