Sometimes hard to find, but worth it every time. Cotswold is simmilar to cheddar but has a sharper, tangier taste with a fruity bite to it. It also has chives in it. It has a softer, creamier texture that almost melts in your mouth when it gets to room temp. and goes well with most hors d'ouvres. It can be addictive as well. I ate half a pound the night before I had my daughters. At least I had a good excuse.
