I consider Bud Light a great beer. Not great in the best tasting beer but more so for function reasons. It tastes fine. It goes down easy. You can drink Bud light until the sun comes up without feeling bloated and weighed down. It is light, refreshing, and easy to drink. This is the kind of beer I sometimes start out with and continue with when I know it is going to be one of those crazy nights. It is a functional beer to get you wasted.
