This movie started out great. As a climber, I loved the introductory scene; all the way to Dad decking. It went WAY down hill after that. The had to shove the love story crap in there;the movie had enough emotional involvement with the brother and sister. Did we REALLY need the Wick/Wife, Wick/Vaughn, Brother/Base-camp nurse, Brother Lives/Brother dies, Cousin Lives/Cousin dies, Everybody dies over-the-top relationship are hell stories? Geez. It got SOOOO predictable, it wasn't even funny. PLEASE tell me they aren't going for a sequel on Everest!
