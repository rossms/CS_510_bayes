Hershey is a neat example of a company town built by someone with Utopian ideals. The surrounding Pennsylvania countryside is pleasant. The town itself basically is the Hershey factory and Hershey Park. It's been a while since I have been to Hershey park, but some years ago it was close to or the equal of Busch Gardens and King's Dominion (both in Virginia).
