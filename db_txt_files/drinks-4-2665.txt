I've never had a problem with service with Gevalia and they do indeed tailor shipments to your preferred schedule. In spite of the very good coffee and fine service however, I have cancelled delivery because I have found eqally good coffe for less money locally. With shipping and handling, which is part of the cost of the coffee, I pay $14. per pound which isn't hard to beat even with some very good gourmet coffee.
