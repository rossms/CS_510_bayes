On the positive side: Has very friendly people, beautiful old buildings, a great art museum, active nightlife, good theatre, affordable housing and a delightful summer and autumn. It's a great place to go to college. On the down side: the economy has been depressed for years, winter and early spring are cold, snowy and very gloomy, and the city has one of the most ineffective and corrupt government you'll find anywhere. This keeps Buffalo from being what it could be All that aside, I think the positives outwiegh the negitives.
