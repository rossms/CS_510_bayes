A great albulm. The track MOP has more great riffs contained on one song than most metal bands come up with on an entire albulm. Ive always prefered And Justice for All though as Metallica's best. AJFA had more diversity and complexity, and Ride The Lighning broke more ground in recording. But this is regarded as their Masterpeice, and when you hear Disposible Hero's or Battery it makes sense. But,If you want a truely classic metal albulm invest in 'Beneath The Remains' - Sepultura or 'Human' - Death ;)
