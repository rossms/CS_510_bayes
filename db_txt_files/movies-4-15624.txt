Cold Mountain had good acting (of course, what more could we expect from Nicole Kidman, Renee Zellwegger and Jude Law?) but it was a bit on the long side. It was portrayed as more of a war story in the commercials, but it soon became obvious that the story was more of a mushy romance, so most of the men in the theater were squirming in their seats half an hour through. It had a sad ending that I didn't expect and was a bit disappointed by . . . otherwise, good film with a fantastic cast and haunting soundtrack.
