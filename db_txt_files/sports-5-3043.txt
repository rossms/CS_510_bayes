Where to start? Mantle was and is the prototype switch-hitter, with 40-homer power, outstanding ability to draw walks, and plus speed (even after his knee injury in his second season). Defensively, he wasn't quite DiMaggio-level, but had superb range. With his ability to get on base and also hit for power, he must be considered one of the top 4 center fielders ever, though not as good as Cobb or Mays.
