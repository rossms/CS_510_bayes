I like Domino's a lot. I enjoy the taste of their sauce and the amount of cheese they put on it. I also like the crust on the regular pizza- I'm not big on thin crust. I have been going there more often lately because they have some good side and non-pizza items- like wings and cinnamon bread sticks for dessert. Yum!
