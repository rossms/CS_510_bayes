Today's Pats play gutsy, tough defensive football and bring the game back to it's roots. Although Drew Bledsoe won the SB as a backup, I'm glad he was there to get a ring. He took such a godawful beating back there during the Pete Carroll days, I'm surprised he's still able to play. A much better football team than they used to be.
