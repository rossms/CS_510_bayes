I have owned (and been stuck with)my 2001 Hyundai Sonata since Summer 01. I was attracted by the low price for this v6 engine car. However I have had my car serviced for problems 20+ times in 4 years. Often my vehicle was detained in the dealership for 4-5 days.If this car is your choice because of the price... I would STRONGLY urge that buyers purchase/request additional coverage for free rental vehicle while your new car is being serviced. It has been my experience to find myself carless far too many times while Hyundai service attempted to rectify numerous problems.
