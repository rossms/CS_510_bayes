Ate there for the first time recently and gotta say I wasn't impressed. Just another theme restaurant going crazy with Mexican accessories etc. Food wasn't bad but wasn't terribly good either. There was something floating or I should say bottom floating in my beer. For two people and fifty bucks I'd rather (and will next time) go someplace nice, local, and more comfortable with better food.
