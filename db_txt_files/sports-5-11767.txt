Even as a freshman, Herschel was a man among boys. He had an unmatched combination of speed (he was a world-class sprinter) and strength (his daily workouts of push-ups and sit-ups are legendary) which enabled to both run by defenders, as well as over them. Unfortunately, to many, he will be remembered as the man who, through his trade to the Vikings, single-handedly rebuilt the Cowboys.
