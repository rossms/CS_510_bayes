Thanks Louie, for reminding me of what makes me like this city, which teems with so much character and history. Great place to walk around and see new things and different people. Have rarely been in better bars than in San Francisco, have rarely eaten better food, have rarely paid more for gasoline (in the US). Oh, and that Amoeba record store on Haight is fantastic too.
