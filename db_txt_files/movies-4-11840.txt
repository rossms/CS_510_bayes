I think it's a good movie...I was disappointed that Seth Green was only in there for like, five minutes before he dies , but the rest of the movie was good too. The movie just proves that the media is force-feeding people what they think should be the next fashion trend...I totally agree with that aspect of the movie. And girls can play guitar, thank you very much...
