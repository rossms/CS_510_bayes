So beautiful, theres soooo much you can do outdoors. If you just like warm big cities then Alaska really isnt your place, but if you are the outdoorsy type......then Alaska is your vacation destination. With some of the worlds most beautiful scenery, king salmon fishing, hiking, amazing camping, in tact wildlife, and so much more. Some of the people there are wierd, but most are very friendly, probably the most friendly state I have been to. Very fun place! Though I dont see myself living there, too isolated.
