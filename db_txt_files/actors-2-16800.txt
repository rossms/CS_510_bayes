john black is like razon burn on my gnads. i bet he thinks that he knows what women want, but, hello, everybody knows that only mel gibson knows that. seriously, though. . .i hope that he never reads this because he probably has more courage stored up there in his half-baked mullet than i have in my entire rat tail. if you are reading this, john, i'm only jokin'. you probably get laid a good deal more than me. what's your trick? is it your throaty voice? now that i think about it razor burn on my gnads isn't that bad.
