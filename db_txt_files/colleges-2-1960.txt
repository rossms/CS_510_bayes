I'm sorry, CU is one of the most overrated undergrad schools in the country. It's horribly expensive for out-of-state students and the academics are adequate at best. Boulder is an extremely expensive town to live in, the average house costs in excess of $300,000. It's a beautiful area and Boulder isn't that bad of a town, it just could be a hell of a lot better.
