Absolutely beautiful school in which you get to experience life through work-study (all students go off campus for a job they find through the school for four months, then come back and study for four months). Only problems are the cafeteria, which is gross, the smoking, which is ninety percent of all students, and the sometimes closed-minded progressive views (but most are willing to have a reasonable debate). The students are very welcoming and it is a real community.
