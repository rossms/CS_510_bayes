This album is amazing! This is one of the few albums that exist where I like every song from it. The vocals blend with the music beautifully, and the mixture of sounds stirring and strong. I didn't even mind the mixture of the smooth lead vocals and the almost-rap-style secondary vocals--it's a difficult combination. The lead vocals are soulful, the lyrics are poetic. The great downfall of this album: Overplayed is an understatement. It became trendy . But, aside from all the hype, this is a CD worth checking out.
