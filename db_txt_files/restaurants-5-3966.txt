A great dining experience. You want variety, CF's got it. The menu was like a phone book and everything we ordered was outstanding. I had a Cajun Steak which was tender, seared nicely on the outside while moist in the inside, and had just the right complement of cajun spice. The kid's menu served real food, not cold, meager grilled cheese, mac they offer an astounding 34 varieties. The filling is soft (almost like mousse), rather than the pasty, dry stuff you get at some places (like Silver Diner). CF is great. Hint: Have an early dinner (before 4:00 PM, else be prepared for long queues).
