Hanson once again will always be #1. All those people who say it sucked well answer this question for me then: How come MMM Bop reached #1 on the billboard charts? A lot of people don't like the song because they think it has no meaning to it. But it does if you have enough brains to listen to the lyrics and listen to what they r saying.
