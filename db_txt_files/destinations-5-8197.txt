This was great I really enjoyed this, $29.99 for two thrill rides. That is a great deal in Vegas. Lots of props from all the tv shows and the movies. Also a nicely layed out time line of events which took place in the Star Trek Universe. Klingons and Borg can be seen wandering around the entire attraction, really a lot of fun.
