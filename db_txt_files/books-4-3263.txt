This is my first koontz book ever and I really enjoyed it from start to finish. Chris Snow is a truely memorable character and adds much depth to the book. Koontz may have been a little heavy on the descriptive level, but not enough to lose his great pace. He kept this book real classy and did not have blood oozing off every page. I will definetly read more of Koontz after zipping through this book.
