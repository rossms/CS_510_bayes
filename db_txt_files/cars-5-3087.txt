The Pontiac Firebird is an awesome car. Sure it has a 3.8 liter V6, but I'll tell you Mustang people one thing that the Firebird V6, ACTUALLY competed with V8 Mustang in power a few yaers back. As far as the Pontiac Trans Am goes, there is no way in hell the 4.6V8 is gonna beat the 5.7V8Trans Am, try again Mustang.
