The Science Place isn't exactly the place were you would want to take your family over the summer. It's strictly for people who want to get bored out of thier minds, or want to learn something. The Science Place is out of the way of the city, and really what it is is a large 3-screen theater in which they show movies about animals, and the jungle and stuff like that, and they also run a program there for children, who go to day care, or thier summer camp, or whatever they have there.
