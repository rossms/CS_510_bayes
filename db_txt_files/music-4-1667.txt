Quite a good collection of songs. The lyrics, melodies, and harmonies on this album are quite magnificent, and John Frusciante has really proven himself to be one of the greatest guitarists of our time. However, this album suffers from the fact that it is very long, and too many of the songs sound similar. This is something that has plagued pretty much every RHCP album. All of the songs are great individually, but it's hard to listen to the entire album at once because it's not all that diverse.
