Nick Collison is yes the best basketball player! He is very good and he is not one of these cocky players who shows off everytime they make a basket.I think that he should be in the top 10 for the NBA Draft. Not to mention he is omg HOTT! Just because KU lost to SU, I still think that KU is the best basketball team going out there! Thanks to nick of course ;) cant forget about kirk either! and i cant wait to meet u nick! I LOVE YOU!
