This place is cool! It combines the old look and style of a colonial market with items that are popular today. There are street performers galore, neat shops to go in, and vendors selling everything under the sun. The food court is huge. Whatever you're feeling like eating, they probably have it. Faneuil Hall adds a little bit of a history lesson if you're interested in checking it out too. This is my favorite stop on the Freedom Trail.
