I never understood why Wendy's was always considered number 3 of the big three fastfood restaurants. The burgers are really tasty and it looks really cool when the cheese is all melted right in between the burger and the bun (mmm!). The fries are my favorite because their not only larger then the other chains' fries, but they usually don't end up burnt from endless hours under a heat lamp. I love Wendy's!
