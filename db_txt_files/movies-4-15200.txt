This is a touching movie about the little horse that could. The story of Seabiscuit is very inspirational, but I felt that the movie overdid just a little with the sentimentality. It felt like the director was trying too hard to pull on the viewer s heartstrings. The performances of the actors were understated and well done. I really enjoyed William H. Macy s performance as the enthusiastic radio announcer. Also, I loved the way that the movie recreated the depression era. Overall, I would recommend this movie to people who enjoy a good story with a lot of heart.
