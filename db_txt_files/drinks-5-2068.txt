I have to admit; I am adicted to SOBE Green Tea. This is especially true now that they sell it at work. Before, I would settle for a Pepsi or Coke out of the vending machine, but now I have a good excuse to walk to the cafeteria and pick up this deliciously sweet green tea. It is also supposed to be good for you. I have not been sick in a while, so maybe it is working???? Compared to other new green teas out there, I like it better than the Snapple or Mistic Green teas.
