I can't rate any cigarette 5 stars, except little cigars. I quit almost four years ago, but for years I switched back and forth between chewing and smoking. I started out at about twelve rolling my own with Prince Albert and Velvet. Then I smoked Winston, Camel Light, and Marlboro Medium. Winston is consistent and adequate, though it always seemed a little harsh after I switched brands.
