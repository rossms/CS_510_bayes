This country is like no other place on the planet. The people are insane, in a friendly, exhuberant kind of way, and there is an incredible array of different adventures that one could have there. The Amazon, Rio, Carnaval, Futbol, the North East, Florianopolis, the German influenced South - the list goes on and on.
