Ewwww!!! Ok, I'm giving this a 2 instead of a one, because before I did try Stouffer's, it was good. BUT...an old roommate worked at Stouffer's (with turkey products). You should have smelled him everyday when he came home!! Barf! He said that there was always raw turkey juice standing about 1-2 deep on the floor, that the workers waded around in everyday, until it was drained. Yuck!! I'll never eat another Stouffers!
