I used to own a SkyTel pager. The hassle was that the process of getting one involved many calls and faxes, and the pager had to be shipped to me. I enjoyed the many functions of the service itself. However, the limited minutes became a hassel. I was not informed that minutes are subtracted each time you listen to your pages. I was overbilled due to this, and the fact that you can't keep track of your use.
