A very good book. Interesting from start to finish. (Although the first few chapters aren't as good as the later ones.) This book gives you plenty of behind the scenes of pro wrestling and shows you that not everything is what it seems. Well written and very interesting (not to mention pretty damn funny). I recommend this book to all wrestling fans and even non-wrestling fans as it's a very good read.
