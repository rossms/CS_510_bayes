The Bulls have a long way to go yet before getting competitive again, but they have done well in recent drafts. I am a huge fan of Ben Gordon. He's usually on the bench, but every time I look at the stat sheet the next day, he's got like at least 15 points. Their young players need a couple more seasons to mature, and when the time comes - everyone watch en and the Bulls take the league by storm.
