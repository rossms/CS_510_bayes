My boyhood idol. It was my reason for playing second base from T-ball through high school. I went to Cooperstown just to see his plaque in the hall. Probably the greatest second baseman ever at least in my eyes. For those who were not old enough to enjoy the Big Red Machine of the 70's you missed one of the greatest teams of all times. The '76 Reds would have crushed the '98 Yankees.
