Without a some of the most enjoyable moments every spent reading. I am a voracious reader. I read everything, and this series is by far one of my top three favourites. Gabaldon is outstanding in many aspects of her craft, but mostly, in my mind, weaving a story from the threads of everyday circumstance. The power of these books lies not in the adventure, not in the fantasy, not in the romance, not in the history, but in the story of two people and how all of the above shapes their lives. The everyday sitting by the hearth bits are the best. She's a master.
