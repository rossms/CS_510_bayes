Aren't blue and roquefort the same thing? Either way, I hate to admit it but I enjoy blue cheese..it is very nasty to think about, 'here, how about some moldy chunky blue cheese on your nice crisp fresh salad'..sure sounds super..I am not sure what it is but it is very unique and satisfying..and of course, being from Upstate New York, hot chicken wings are nothing without a good slathering of blue cheese.
