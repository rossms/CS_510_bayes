They got Flip Saunders when Brown left, and he's an offensive mind-perfect for the Pistons, since they're already as good as you can get at defense. Yeah they lost last year in the Finals, and a lot of people are dissing them now, saying their championship in 2004 was a "fluke." Hey, they got back to the finals, and pushed that series to seven games. Stupid Ginobili drove me nuts slashing all day and bombing threes, but I admit that he had it going sicne the Pistons' vaunted D couldn't stop him. Still the best overall team in the league.
