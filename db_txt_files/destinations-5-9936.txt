Camel Lights are far superior to any other name brand light cigarette. Particularily,Marlboro Lights, which have a particularly unpleasant arifical/chemical like taste. Camel Lights are much smoother, have a rich satisfying complex flavor (must be the Turkish tobacco...). Be careful cause the box version tends to be a slightly harsher and seems to go stale quicker. For maximum smoking satisfaction buy a FRESH soft pack of Camel Lights. These really are the best light cigarettes on the market.
