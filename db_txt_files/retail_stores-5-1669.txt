Love it, a great place to do a little shopping. I have always noticed that K Marts are a little dirty, atleast the ones Ive been in, but they have good stuff at some reasonable prices. But dont go to the electronics department, they have no idea how to price stuff there. I once saw a 3 year old Madden Football game for a system that was no longer being made and they still had it marked at $50.
