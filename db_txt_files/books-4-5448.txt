I was so surprised that Wally Lamb is a man because Dolores (the main character in this book) has thoughts like I did when I was younger. You just assume the author is a woman. The book takes you through her tramas and dramas. She has a very tramatic life. Everyone can relate to some of her issues she develops throughout the book. The last 50 pages drag and the ending lacks but it is still a good book.
