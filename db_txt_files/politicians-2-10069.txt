Aside from being President by coincidence during 9/11 and starting his own little misguided war in Iraq, what has this man done, honestly? On the international front, he has alienated us from even our allies. He has no domestic policy. He has bankrupted the country. He has pandered to the religious right while ignoring the rest of American. Now he wants to fix social security. How does that make him great? I give him 2 stars, because at least he's better than Nixon.
