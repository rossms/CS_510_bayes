Grizzy smokeless is one of the surpises in the tobacco world that I'm glad I found. With the soaring gas prices, and extra taxes being levied on tobacco products, I have been fiscally forced to look for a viable alternative to Copenhagen. The taste of the Natural (fine cut) and Straight (long cut) is very similar to the Cope flavor I'm used to. I HIGHLY recommend this to anyone looking to make a switch. (and it seems to have a little more kick than Cope, also)
