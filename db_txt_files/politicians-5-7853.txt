Harry S Truman was one of the great Presidents of the 20th Century. He was not really appreciated until much later (especially after he died), though. Yet, to look at Truman's record is to see a man who did what he felt was right. Truman was a man who was reknown for his common sense and sound judgment. And never were these more apparent than when he ordered the dropping of the atomic bomb on Japan to quickly end the war in the Pacific. Truman definitely did the right thing, regardless of what others may think, and generations of Americans owe a lot to this President.
