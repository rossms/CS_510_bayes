At first thought, the idea of mixing a cola and vanilla flavor into one pop may not sound like a great idea. Though I don't think it's one of the most creative or original ideas to have ever been concocted and I don't think it's great, I do like the taste a lot, nonetheless. I even prefer this over regular Coca Cola (which isn't a great surprise considering that I'm not a big cola fan, per se) but I don't prefer Vanilla Coke over ales and vanillas NOT MIXED with other flavors. Very decent, nonetheless.
