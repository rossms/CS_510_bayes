i can't explain in here what he means to college basketball. 2-time AP all-american, 3-time ACC player of the year, scored over 2,000 points in just the 3 years he was allowed to play in at that time (that rule changed because of him, as with the no-dunking rule). went 54-1 in 2 years, winning National championship in the year when his team was allowed to go to postseason. Far better than anyone else on this list.
