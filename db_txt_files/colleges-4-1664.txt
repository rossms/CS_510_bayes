Good school that produces a number of high-profile alumni, people you've seen on the news or making news. They have an excellent School of Communications and some other worthy programs. If you want to work in NYC, you'll find your fair share of SU alumni in The City. Syracuse the town isnt a bad place to go to school in , but upstate NY can be depressing with all the snow and overcast weather. This isnt a factor to take lightly either. Good sports teams at SU. There are a lot of jewish students and a lot of very pretty black girls who go to SU.
