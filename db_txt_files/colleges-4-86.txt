When I was looking at MBA programs, I visited this school and got a first hand taste of the brutal workload. The day I was there, two whitecoated individuals came into a class which I was sitting in on, and forcibly removed one of the students. I found out later from my guide, that the guy had freaked out under the stress - he had stopped showering and talking to people, and would just sit by himself shivering in the corner during class. Fortunately for me, I was not accepted into this program, and therefore was not faced with the decision of whether to willingly subject myself to this kind of abuse.
