Great game, but it was frustrating to play with the whole family, because your parents had such a huge advantage. When it comes to questions involving 20th century history, kids can't compete with people who actually experienced the past four or five decades. Give me a pack of questions on 1985-1999 movies and I'll kick anyone's ass.
