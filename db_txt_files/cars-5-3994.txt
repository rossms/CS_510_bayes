I really do beg to differ! Buick has really hit a home run on this one. It has answered my needs. It has style and functinallity. Now when I am out shopping or at an auction and I purchase something larger than will fit in a regular vehicle this is great. I love the room and dont have to give up my buick ride. I am not old and have driven buicks for several years now wouldnt own anything else. I strayed once and boy what a mistake.
