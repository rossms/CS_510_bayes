I never saw him in his Silence of the Lambs movies; I was too chicken. I did see him in a couple of Merchant and Ivory movies and in Hearts of Atlantis. He is immensely talented and has great range. UPDATE:Raine21, while I agree that Anthony Hopkins is a fine actor, I disagree that he's the only man who could play Hannibal Lecter. I think Dick Cheney could play this role to the hilt.
