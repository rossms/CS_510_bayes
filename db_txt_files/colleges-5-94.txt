Berkeley is NOT a hippie university despite the free speech movement and 60s protests. 40% of the student body is asian. What? Are all these asians and smart kids hippies? The 60s leftovers you see are mostly people living in the town and selling 60s trinkets to tourists like tonythebomb along Telegraph Ave. It's a highly rated business school. The overall University is the most highly rated public university in the country.
