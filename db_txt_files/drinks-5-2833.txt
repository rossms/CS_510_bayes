I enjoy the taste of Maxwell House coffee. I buy the large-sized tins of it on sale. Besides the taste, I also like to buy this brand because they do alot of great things for charities involved with children and the homeless. On a lesser note, I love most of their commercials, especially the older one where the mom and her child move into their new home. (a beach house?) Excellent music.
