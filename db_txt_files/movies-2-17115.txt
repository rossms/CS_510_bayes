When this movie came out, I read that it was like a Red Shoes Diaries episode (Showtime's faux-arty, lotsa-nudity series). Now having seen it, I can even say that description hits the nail on the head, maybe even does a disservice to Red Shoes Diaries! I managed to fall asleep in the middle. Any movie with Nicole Kidman that makes you fall asleep has to be a real drag...
