Once Favre leaves, the Packers WILL NOT be the doormat of the NFC North. Nearly every person says this, but they fail to realize the quarterbacks that are currently being trained, upcoming drafts, trades, etc. They are also forgetting that Ahman Green will likely still be there for a couple more years after Favre's retirement, as well as the young group of up-and-coming receivers. Stop being a bunch of morons and realize that the Packers won't suck after Favre leaves.
