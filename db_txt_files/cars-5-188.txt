There is a reason this machine dominated atv racing for 15 years after it was discontinued. Engineering and performance that couldn't be touched. I've ridden them but I've never owned one because who can afford them when used ones would go for almost double the original msrp. With the new 450R's, YFZ's and now the LTR-450 Quadracer we're finally seeing a shift away from the 250r's and I might be able to afford one soon.
