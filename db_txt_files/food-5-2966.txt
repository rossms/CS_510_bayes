I blame my sister for my current addiction to mini Oreos. I liked Oreos growing up, but I was never drawn to them as an adult. The other day, my sister mentioned how much she liked mini Oreos, so I bought a bag. I was hooked immediately. I don't know why they taste so much better than the full-size version, but they do. Mini Oreos are awfully cute cookies, too, which adds to their appeal. They come in a self-sealing pouch, which is much more convenient than the standard Oreo packaging. If you haven't had an Oreo since you were a kid, give these a try.
