Steve is by far the best. The first game I ever watched was the 1994 Superbowl and it had a huge effect on me. From that day forward I was hooked. It made me excited to watch him play, great QB, great scrambler, He was definitely the bomb. I was devistated when he retired but I'm happy for the years I did watch him play.
