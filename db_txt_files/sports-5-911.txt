Bernie Williams is an excellent player. His election to the all-star team the past couple years have been deserved by Bernie. He is a very good offensive centerfielder, almost always hitting 25+ home runs, having 100+ RBIs, and batting over .300. He also gets 200+ hits. Also, the gold gloves Williams has won are definitely deserved as well. He can run down a fly ball like no centerfielder I've seen. He has uncanny speed, although not the greatest base runner. He is an amazing all-around player, both defensively and offensively. He is my favorite outfielder in the entire league.
