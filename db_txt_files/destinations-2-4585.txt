Been there only once. It was in the summer and the bugs seemed to run the place. I heard a line about women wearing Off instead of perfume. After a day, I tended to believe it. I didn't hate the place, and maybe I wasn't there long enough to see the finer points that people kept talking about, but I was indifferent to it.
