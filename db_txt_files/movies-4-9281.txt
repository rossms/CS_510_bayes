a 4.5. a very dark comedy Harold is a 21 man who is obsessed with death he even drives a hearse he goes to funerals of strangers as a hobby. he meets Maude who also goes to funerals for the same reason. they strike up a friendship. she is quite eccentric old lady of almost 80. there are some very funny scenes one where she steals a tree to take it back to the woods. not to mention Harolds odd but funny fake suicides. This is a dark comedy for sure and not for everyone. I found it qiute funny myself.
