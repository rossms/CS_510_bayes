If New Jersey is such a bad place, why is it rated the 11th healthiest state to live in?? Stop voting because of stereotypes. Sure, NJ has it's trashy parts but what state doesn't?? NJ has beaches, forests, mountains. The education system in NJ is also renowned for it's quality. Not a bad place to live in. Sure it has flaws, but every state does.
