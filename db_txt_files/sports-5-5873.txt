JJ Redick not only is the best pure shooter ever to go through Cameron Indoor, but the entire NCAA. He can be a elite player at the next level, watch out. If any one wants to argue i will be happy to, just know that you will lose.....badly. I am not a diehard duke fan either, this is purely me evaluating talent of the leading scorer in Virginia High School Basketball history.
