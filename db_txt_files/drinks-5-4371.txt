12 year old single malt. In my opinion as a relative philistine of the whisky-drinking world (I'm happy to recommend a decent scotch over a single malt, and I'll always drink it with water or soda). By far and away the best whisky that you can buy for under 30. It's got a really accessible taste, so it will suit the mainstream palate more so than it's competitors. Don't buy Glenfiddich, don't by Laproaig, don't buy Glenmorangie. Buy Highland Park.
