If Iverson ever got traded from the 76ers, I would not be a Sixers fan anymore. He's got the skills, the passion and the drive to be the best player in the game today. His stats prove it!! Coach Brown would be crazy to ever trade him and now since the Sixers got Mutumbo, thet're unstopable! I mean, Iverson is the reason I started watching the Sixer games again. He's got it all and if he gets traded, that would be the dumbest thing the franchise ever did. He's gonna go down in history. Plus... HE'S GORGEOUS!!!
