Where this film stands up is in its depiction of modern warfare in all it's shocking brutality - particularly the first 20 minutes. The actual plot is a bit of a romp and makes no claim on historical accuracy, but does take the viewer across multiple battle zones in which American soldiers fought in the first few days of the Normandy Campaign. It does get a tad political at times, but without detracting too much from the power of the story.
