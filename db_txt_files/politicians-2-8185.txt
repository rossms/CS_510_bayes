I hate to sound callous, but would we even remember this guy if he hadn't been assassinated? Yes, he was charming and handsome, and yes he was apparently a good speaker-who had good speechwriters. But to me he seems he was all image and no substance. He was also the ultimate hypocrite-pretending to be the ultimate family man when he was chasing anything remotely female. He wouldn't have gotten as far as he did if he didn't have his very aggressive and unprincipled family pulling strings for him. I'm sorry he got killed, but I don't think much of him as a man or as a president.
