Trix has good flavor and it's nice to start the day with such cheery colors in your cereal bowl. Although I liked Trix better before the extra sugar coating was added (when the cereal was just little colored balls), it's still good and not as sweet as many of the other sugary cereals like Froot Loops, Frosted Flakes, etc. It's a bit too expensive, like most cereals, and not Great! enough to spend that kind of money on it. I only buy it on sale.
