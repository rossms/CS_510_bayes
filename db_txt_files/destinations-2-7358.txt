France is very beutifull but overrated. There is more to see in spain or italy. I also agree with mcspongeicus, american people get offended when someone talks a foreign language around them but if they go outside the USA they get mad if you don't know english. Being born in Venezuela, I have gotten rude comments for speaking spanish with friends.
