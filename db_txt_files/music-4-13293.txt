Niggas don't be knowin' nuthin bout no Three-6. This group doesn't receive the recognition they should be getting. They remind me a little of Goddie Mob. They have staying power. In a few months, after the hype of losers like DMX, MAster P, Juvenile, etc. goes down, groups like three 6 mafia will rise to the top where they belong.
