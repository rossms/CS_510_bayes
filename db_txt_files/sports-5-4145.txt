Tark was a good. He did all coaches a favor by speaking up against the NCAA. He was wrongly harrassed by the NCAA. Four final fours in 25 years is pretty impressive, especially doing it at a school that had no history other than a small run to the NCAA small schools final four right before Jerry came on the scene. If it wasn't four some blantantly unfair officiating in 1977 and 1991, Tark would have three titles to his name.....as it is, the man's team left officiating out of the equation by blowing Duke off the floor in 1990 to break the margin of victory record in the title game.
