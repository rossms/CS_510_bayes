Over-rated underachiever. He managed almost to destroy USA economy with his bone-headed embargo and foreign relations. He was a coward during the Revolution. He was Governor of Virginia and totally dropped the ball. He fled when the going got tough and the Fathers of Virginia had to replace him! Louisana purchase moves him up to two stars. He cribbed the Declaration of Independence and was heavily edited, in any case.
