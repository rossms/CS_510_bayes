Go in early fall, after the summer crowds have died down a bit, but before it gets too cold. And stay in venice! I think a lot of people with negative impressions only go there during the day. The best time to be there is at night- you basically have the place to yourself. Very romantic. The Hotel Danelli was great. Worth the extra $$$.
