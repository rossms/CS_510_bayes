Having been a US Marine, I fell in love with Hummers. I now own a 1999 4-door soft top. Its my daily driver, and the best vehicle I've ever driven. Its gorgeous, attracts lots of attention, is the single safest vehicle to be in during an accident, can go anywhere, can haul 2 tons of cargo, is fun, has no problem in snow and ice, can pull people out of ditches, extremely reliable and durable, etc. The folks who gave them low ratings never owned one, and probably can't afford one - sounds like jealousy or just plain ignorance.
