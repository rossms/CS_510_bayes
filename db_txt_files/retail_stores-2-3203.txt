Very expensive. The no late fee thing has resulted in poor selection and increased rental prices. I like to rent a bunch of 7 day movies. Blockbuster charger you $13.99 for six 7 day rentals. Rogers, the other big chain (in Canada) charges $11.99 for seven 7 day rentals. (or $10.99 for 6) selection is also much better. I avoid Blockbuster
