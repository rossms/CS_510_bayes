Oddly, I haven't seen this movie until yesterday (I try to stay away from Disney flicks), and wondered what the big hype was about. Now I get it. It's a simple story about an overprotective parent losing, searching for, and being reunited with his child. The characters were all pretty colorful (though Dory got pretty irritating pretty quick, I think that was the point). The animation was beyond excellent, the water effects were incredible. For the few people who haven't seen this yet, you probably should--it's very likable and cute.
