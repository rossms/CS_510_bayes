BOOOOO!!! Bad movie that is as original as ice water. Follows the same blueprints of any other slasher film. Dead-pan, tough lead male with a strong willed inquisitive lead woman who are followed along by the horny couple while another horny couple waits for help. And we all know what that means. What makes it worse is the stereotypical West Virginia Inbreds as the killers. Seriously, that stereotype is as old and tired as this horror film formula. Doesn't even explain why they kill. Don't waste your time.
