I'm a UNC alum, but I have to admit that K is an outstanding coach. The numbers speak for themselves. Still, the Duke program isn't as picture perfect as the media seem to think. The players' SAT scores are dramatically lower than those for Duke as a whole, and almost all of them major in sociology, a notorious gut. (These same things are true at UNC too, but the Vitales of the world have never created the misimpression that UNC players are brilliant scholars who just happen to play hoops.)
