This guy plays the game the way it is supposed to be played. The object to the game is to win. This isn't the parks and rec league where they give out trophies for participation, who cares how good you look while you lose? His game reminds me somewhat of Kevin McHale's. Another guy who know what it takes to be a winner. Keep the playground crap for the playground. That showboat garbage is the reason why the international teams kick our asses every year. You don't do a sack dance when your down 40-0 with two minutes left in the 4th quarter. That is, unless you like losing.
