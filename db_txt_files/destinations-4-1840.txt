I find it hard to give any country a 5 as no-one is perfect. Purely speaking froma geographical point of view, I think the US has it all - throbbing cities like New York, San Fran, Boston, Chicago, Philly, Miami, LA, Seattle.... the mountainous beauty of Colorado or Washington State, the desrts of Arizona and New Mexico, the latin jive of Florida, Hollywood, the roaming wjeatfield of the mid-west, New England in the Autumn, the Arctic wilderness of Alaska and the Pacif climate and volcanic splendour of Hawaii. It's be hard to find a country to beat it. Shame about the people, though.
