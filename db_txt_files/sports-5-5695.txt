I have been a fanatic of Philly Big 5 Basketball since 1969. I've seen a lot of good ones through the years: Howard Porter, Larry Cannon, Dave Wohl, L-Train, Ed Pinckney, Mark Macon, et. al. But I think Jameer is the best player I've seen out of a Philly college. I applaud his decision to stay in school; as a result, his stock has raised substantially. He was sensational in the Wake Forest game, and my heart was crushed to see him just come short against Oklahoma State (which was not really a team, but a group of JUCOs and transfers). Jameer will be a great 1- or 2-guard in the NBA.
