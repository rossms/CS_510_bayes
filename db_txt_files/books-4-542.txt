A great novel from Roald Dahl. I really enjoyed the Dreams do come true theme that carried on through the novel, and at some points, the characters to me actually seemed to be ones that I could relate to. The characters were really well-developed and I could understand Charlie's inner struggles. Like most, however, I do prefer the movie over the book.
