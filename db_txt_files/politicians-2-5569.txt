Gale Norton is a lousy choice for Dept. of Interior. She is almost exclusively pro-corporation and frequently anti-conservation. The people of Alaska do not own the Artic National Wildlife Refuge. It's owned by ALL of us. So, all of congress has a right to say what happens to it. Plus, why aren't people talking about gas conservation, mass transportation, alternative sources of energy, etc? That's what will loosen our dependence on foreign oil, NOT drilling in ANWR!! We need to stop driving those huge SUV's to the local 7-11!
