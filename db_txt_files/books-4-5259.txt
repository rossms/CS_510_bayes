This was an amzing book and a boy who ever dreamed of being a cardinal one day instead of being a cotten picker for the family is great dream to become that some day. Poor guy who had to go through with all that he did go through. Good thing PAPPY was there for him, I believe he was the one he could always turn too...Too bad that happened at the end of the book what had happened(Trying Not To give the book away).......
