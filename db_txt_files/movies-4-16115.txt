Great film, especially if you've ever been to Chicago. This movie very realistically depicts the city around the time of prohibition, and is a powerful portrayal of the corruption of the time. It's not perfect - someof the scenes that are a little over the top, but it's so well made and so true to the time period that it's certainly well worth seeing.
