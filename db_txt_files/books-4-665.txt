I liked reading the Curious George books way back when I was a kid. The little monkey who got himself in a lot of trouble with his curiousity for the things around him. I like books that have been around for years and still hold up today. It is nice that my own children got to enjoy Curious George when they were little. I hope that Curious George and the man with the yellow hat{did he ever have a name?} stay around for generations to come.
