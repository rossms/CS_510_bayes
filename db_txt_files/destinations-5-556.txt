It is very irresponsible to highlight only the negative things of a city. I like Florida but it has many negative things and that doesnt change the good of this place. A high percent of San Juan's population consists of well prepared people and an 80% of the high school students make it to the an University...most of the USA young people dont. We are hoping to become a state of the USA to improve our Island because USA also needs us.
