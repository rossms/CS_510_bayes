I can understand peoples views about this movie being boring. It is a slow movie. It is a movie you have to sit back and watch. I liked this movie because it was twisted and sexual. I liked the scenes with Millitch at the costume shop. Millitch's teenage daughter was jaw dropping. If i acted in that scene, i would have to take a cold shower afterwards.
