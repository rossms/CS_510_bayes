In the past 10-15 years it has amazed me to see several former rappers move on to do serious acting inclding drama. Ice Cube was very good in Dangerous Ground. Although I was disappointed with Ghosts of Mars (a John Carpenter production) I thought Ice Cube performed well. He is currently going through comedies and other roles but I look forward to another more dramatic role as in Dangerous Ground. He seems very capable but has yet to really get any great roles. I will be interested to see him in more demanding roles. I think he'll do well.
