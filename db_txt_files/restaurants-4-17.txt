Wow, brand new in Des Moines and a cut above Starbucks anyday. The comfortable feeling starts when you walk through the door with the smell of great coffee [duh], the warm fire and huge leather chairs sitting around the living room type set-up. All the employees were friendly [it is still new] and I walked away wanting to come back which is half the battle for a new establishment - especially the first one in a market.
