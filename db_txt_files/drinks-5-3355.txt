Whoever said this was a bad-tasting cider must be mentally retarded. Really. What a spectacular tasting-cider, tart, without the excessive sweetness that so many other ciders have. Cider-drinking is an inherently feminine activity, but if I have to drink cider, this is undoubtedly the best of the lot, and certainly the choice of any real Man worth his salt.
