I bought my 97 Altima in 99, it had only 19,000 miles on it. It now has 98,500 miles on it, and virtually trouble free. I have styled it up a little with 16 inch aluminum wheels, lowered the suspension 1 inch (to remove unwanted gap in wheel wells), and bronze tinted the windows. It is a great everyday driver.
