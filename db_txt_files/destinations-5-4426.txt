Indianapolis has one of the cleanest downtown's I have ever been in, they have a big mall and many, many expensive resturants downtown. Indianapolis seems to be overwhelmingly middle-class, with less poverty than most cities of its size. I just have one problem with Indianapolis it is very, very generic city (Indianapolis should not be so bland having almost 2 million people in the metro area) with greasy spoon diners all over the place. The Hotel rooms in Indianapolis are dirt cheap.
