What the reviewer below(Reverend Thomas Kerry) failed to do before writing his comments was to actually see Requiem For A Dream. She was superb in that excruciatingly painful movie. Believe me when I say it did not romanticize or glorify sex or addiction. It was a very painful movie to watch if you have a history like mine. Jennifer nailed her part fairly well. She turned out to be a better actress than I had expected. This was a very serious role that could lead to some non-bimbo parts. Hubert Selby(Last Exit To Brooklyn) wrote Requiem.
