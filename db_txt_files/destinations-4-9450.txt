The Fisherman's Bastion is a bit of schlock art (the Hugarians are the first to admit it). In itself, it's nothing much to brag about, but taken as a part of the whole complex on Castle Hill, next to Matthias Church, and because of the really great view of the Pest side of the river from the Bastion, it rates a 4. Otherwise, it's a 3 at best.
