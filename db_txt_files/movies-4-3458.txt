This movie is hilarious for anyone who understands UK humor. It's not an action movie first, it's a comedy first, and that's what noneone here in N. America understand. The action is derivitive of everything and it's unoriginal - so what? That's not the point. It's the facial expressions and dialogue that people are missing over here. And, by the way, just b/c the F-word is used so many times doesn't mean a thing. Real people actually swear this regularly in real life - so get over it and go see this movie. It's REALLY funny. If you need subtitles to understand the English then don't bother.
