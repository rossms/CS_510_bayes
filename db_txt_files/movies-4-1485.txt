Lots of fun to watch, Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom is great. I think it's the only Indiana Jones movie that DOESN'T involve Nazis. I wasn't a big fan of Willie, but I like the interactions between Indiana, Willie and Shorty. The dinner scene was so funny ( Ahhhh . . . chilled monkey brains . . . Oh, man, it's so gross that you HAVE to laugh!).
