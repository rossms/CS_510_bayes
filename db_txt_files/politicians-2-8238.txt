He was is an overrated president and he is thought of as a good president because he was assassinated and had a family. That was awful but it doesn't make you a good president. He almost got the US into a nuclear war with Cuba(and hence USSR) and liked the ladies a bit too much (like Clinton who also admires him). I might have given him an extra star if he had a better charachter.
