did you know that they can do insurance direct bills? I needed to get into a rental car recently after an accident and was able to get a nice, CLEAN, new car from them instead of the 2 or sometimes 3 year old clunkers I have rented from other neighborhood rental agencies that always seem to be at dealerships and body shops. Its nice to have another option.
