The customer service at the meat counter couldn't be better anywhere else. They cut their meat right at the window where you can watch them, ask them questions, get advice. The meat manager named Steve will go out of his way to help any customer even out of his department. Over all the store that I shop at on Venice Island, I give it a 10, for customer service, quality, and value.
