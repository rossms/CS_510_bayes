the current hipster favorite. seems to go well with trucker hats, cell phones, and beat-up plaid shirts. i've never been a fan of the taste but have found myself drinking Pabsts more in NYC b/c it's usually the cheapest beer in a bar(lots of NYC bars like to cater to the hopster element and have $2 cans of pabsts to go w/their $5 bottles of Bud). other than Iron City, Pabst was the first beer i'd ever heard about courtesy of the 1980 film midnight madness anyone remember that movie?
