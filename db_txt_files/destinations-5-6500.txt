Poor Texas - it's been getting a bump rap these days due to Bush. I can't stand Texas' politics, but it's one of the most colorful, folsky, and charming places in America. The people are super-friendly, and it is very unique in its own culture. It is always a pleasure visiting the state, and I wouldn't mind living there someday. I love you Texas!
