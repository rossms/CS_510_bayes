This is by far the best dip ever! I mean how can you go wrong with something that has been here since 1822 and is still going strong today? The best taste and feeling come from cope than any other rub. The pouches are by far the best ones because there is about 3 times more rub in one pouch than in one dip from the pouchless rub which means more nicotine. Also, it doesn't leave little bits of tobacco in your mouth like the pouchless. Why not do the pouch? It is no girlier than the regular... if anything it is more manlier do to the higher amounts of tobacco per dip. DO THE POUCHES IF YOUR GONNA DO COPE!!!
