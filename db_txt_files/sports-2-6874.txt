I think it's too early to judge Danny's moves because the players he got need time to develope. The Celtics probably went as far as they could with their old players and style of play. The reason I give him a bad rating is because Jim O'Brien and the entire organization should have been informed and comfortable with Ainge's vision before any moves were made. How can you work toward a goal if you don't have all your guys on the same page? Ainge & O'Brien should have resolved this stuff before Walker was traded. The Celtics look like a disorganized mess again as a result.
