I grew up with drinking Vernor's at my great-grandmother's house in Detroit. It's incredible that I was drinking the product made the same way as Vernor had made it, from the same bottling plant built by him. Now that I live in Georgia, I just buy it online at the website of the same name. Kinda expensive, but VERY WELL worth it!
