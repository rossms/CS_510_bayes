In terms of innovative production and new sounds, it was certainly notable. It's bland for the most part though. While I will admit that the overplayed "More Than A Feeling" was a very good song, I think that a good rule of thumb is to avoid bands named after states or countries, they tend to suck. EARLY Chicago was a good band, but they soon started to suck, and look at the rest of the corporate, lame acts named after geopolitical entities: Kansas, Asia, Europe,etc. YUCK!
