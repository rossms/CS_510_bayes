I was a little skeptical when this guy got all of that big money from the Magic. Sure, he performed well in the slam dunk contest, but how could a guy who had never been to an All-star game, let alone been a regular starter, gotten that big of a contract. Well, I don't think that is too early to say that the Magic have gotten their money's worth. He is the real thing. He can do everything on the floor and, at 21, is only going to get better.
