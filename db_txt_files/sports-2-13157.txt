I do not care for CU one bit, and while I want to give them a one, it's hard to ignore their recent success (Big XII champs, Beating Nebraska, BCS berth). However, Missouri got CHEATED in 1990 - not once, but twice - It was 4th and goal for Colorado - Missouri stopped them. The refs somehow gave Colorado a fifth down - Mizzou *clearly* stopped them short of the goal line that time, but it was ruled a touchdown. CU wins. Was that game fixed?
