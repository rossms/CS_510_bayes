I've had service with Sprint PCS and T-Mobile in the past, and neither can compare with AT T Wireless here in the DFW area. I have good sound reception everywhere I go, and nice customer service people to deal with... (Poor customer service and a lack of right answers were one of the main reasons I left Sprint T-Mobile.) My friends also have AT T and love it--unlike my father who does business work around DFW and uses Sprint--he gets dropped all the time.
