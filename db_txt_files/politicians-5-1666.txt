Arnie is sly politician. He is achieving his goals behind peoples backs. I am not saying that this is right, but if he actual told the public what his true intents really were, he probably would not be in office now. He always wanted to fund school programs from the beginning, before he was a politician. Now he is achieving his goal no matter what the cost. His mind is a mystery, just like it was on the bodybuilding stage!
