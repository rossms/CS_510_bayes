I happen to believe that Toyotas are the most dependable cars out there and my '89 Toyota Camry has proven to be no exception. Excellent in all respects. One drawback is that along with Honda Civics, these are the most stolen used cars in the US. This is partly because there are so many out there --these cars are great, why wouldn't there be a lot in the market... Point being, used Toyota Camrys are a great investment and it would never hurt to get the Club as well!
