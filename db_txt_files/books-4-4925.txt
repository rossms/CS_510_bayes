This is a pretty intense story about the arrest, imprisonment, and abuse of a political dissident under a communist regime. It does an excellent job of discussing the shifting winds of politics and the way ideology and belief often become subservient to and perverted by the quest for power. Darkness at Noon is a short, powerful book that should be required reading for anyone interested in human nature, communist Russia, or any kind of totalitarian regimes.
