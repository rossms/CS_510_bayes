All of the pokemon series are great. Not a particularly violent game and very enjoyable and user friendly. My daughters love all of them and ask for help all the time. The games are vast given the small size. I was impressed by the complexity of the game. A nice adventure game for kids. Due to the simple fact that Silver and Gold are identical this rating applies to both.
