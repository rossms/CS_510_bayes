I really enjoyed this book. If you've seen the movie and not read the book do yourself a favor and read it, don't let the movie be your only impression. It's amazingly well written and really quite a cliffhanger. What's especially interesting is how much detail he goes into about the technical aspects of such a storm, the pressure that modern ships can stand, incidents of other storms and other ships that have been lost. He also goes into the whole training of the PJ's the guys who do search and rescue for the Coast Guard and that is incredible. Very good book and worth the read!!
