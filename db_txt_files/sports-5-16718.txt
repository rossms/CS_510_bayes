It's hard not to rate a 13-0 team a 5, even if you think they have a weak run defense and an overrated secondary. Offensively, they're rock solid. Defensively, they have holes, but nothing that anyone could take advantage of... yet. I don't honestly think they're the strongest team we've seen in recent years, (the Steelers last year were way better), but a weak schedule makes them look alot better.
