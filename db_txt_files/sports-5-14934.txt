Troy deserves more recognition than he gets. He's one of the great competitors this game has ever seen, OH!! and also one of the winningest. Sure he didn't throw up fancy numbers like Marino, Elway, or Montana, but I thought winning was the most important. 3 Superbowl vics, 5 Pro bowls, 1 superbowl MVP, plus 55 cowboy passing records. He is perfection under pressure, 70% completion percentage all-time in the playoffs, with a QB rating of 110 or higher. He deserves to mention among the great QB's of all-time, and I'll be the one campaigning on his behalf.
