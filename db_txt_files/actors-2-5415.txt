Had his moment as a Brat Packer, but you've got to develop beyond that and Lowe hasnt. Did a good job in a movie called Bad Influence, but that was 14 years ago. Was good in a Wayne's World movie, but again that was ages ago. He made a boneheaded move in leaving The West Wing and went onto Dr. Vegas? That alone drops him a one star, if not more than one.
