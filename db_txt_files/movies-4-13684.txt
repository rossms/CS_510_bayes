A movie that can mix the comedic and dramatic elements of storytelling as effectively is not dumb at all. This one is a feather in Robin William's cap. I enjoyed this film every time I've had chance to watch. Laugh about life and all its seriousness in one place, and then remember what matters most in the next. Simply brilliant.
