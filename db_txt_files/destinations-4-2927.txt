as a person who cannot stand homogeneity, i find new york city to be the perfect solution to getting lost in (literally) a world of cultures - not just manhattan, but surrounding areas as well. unfortunately for a needs-her-space girl like me, manhattan gets overly congested & unbearable at times. thank goodness for the wknd getaways.
