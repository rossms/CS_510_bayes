I JUST WANTED TO SAY I'M SORRY TO ALL YOU GUYS WHO CAN'T SEEM TO FIND TWISTED TEA. I'M FROM PHILLY AND YOU CAN GET IT EVERYWHERE THERE, YOU CAN ALSO GO TO NEW JERSEY BEER DISTRIBUTERS TO FIND IT. I THINK TWISTED TEA IS THE BEST DRINK ON THE FACE OF THIS EARTH AND IF I COULDN'T FIND IT I THINK I WOULD DIE. I HAVE BEEN TRYING TO FIND OUT HOW MANY CALORIES IT HAS SO IF ANYONE KNOWS PLEASE E-MAIL ME AT gmm195@psu.edu
