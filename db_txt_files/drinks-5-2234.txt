Genmai is a variety of green tea brewed with roasted rice (though, I'm not sure whether it's always roasted, nor whether it's usually white or brown rice), which gives it a distinctly toasty flavor. This unsweetened beverage also includes pearl barley. The rice and barley add more depth to the flavor, though it's not as rich as soba tea, for example. If you're not familiar with the brand, Ito En is marketing bottled teas in the US similar to those commonly found in Japan and other asian countries.
