An overall good place to visit. Especially around February when New Year's is going on (lots of parties, parades, fireworks etc). The living conditions are a little low, but for very little money you can find a good place to sleep. Food is great as well, lots of vendors and different things to choose from. There are a lot of open markets and beaches, temples and other landmarks also. Scenery is spectacular. Only problem some might have are the pickpockets, mosquitoes and heat. Otherwise a decent place to stop by.
