A superb coach having a Roster of only about 110 Players and recruiting on average about only 2 Stars, yet he wins with them. He will only do better too once he goes to a bigger school. A great coach at any school by developing his players no matter what the talent levels. Needs to beat Maryland soon or I will lower my rating.
