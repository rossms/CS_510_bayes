The only Michael Mann film I liked was Ali with Will Smith, but apart from that I'm not a fan of Michael Mann's work at all. I couldn't stand Heat despite the amazing cast and this film bored me to tears until I fell asleep, I watched it again to give it a second chance and once again I had a good sleep. Russell Crowe is an outstanding actor and the movies plot about the tabacco industry was so interesting with so much potential, but the documentary style just simply didn't work. The way this film was directed and the over-ambitious storytelling was beyond poor.
