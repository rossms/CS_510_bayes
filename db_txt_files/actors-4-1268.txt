Very good range but not always convincing. Once Upon A Time In America was his best role to me. I am sure many others would say his best work is found elsewhere. Not a big deal really. His recent stints into comedy hurt him. He did attempt to expand his range but the choices were not good. Analyze This/That were poor at best and Showtime was AWFUL. His dramatic work is very good. His role in the remake of Cape Fear was also very impressive. Not sure it's better than the original as a movie or in the role. It was well done though.
