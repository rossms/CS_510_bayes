C'mon now. We all know that Kobe ain't no Allen I. But he has an ill team around him all the time: Shaquille, Derek Fisher, and Rick Fox. These Fantastic Four make the other shine at any given moment, at any court, in any city. This team, in my opinion is comparable to the mighty Chicago Bulls during their 7 World Championships' run. Just remember about those Bulls. Jordan, pippen, kukoc, Paxon, Rodman, Grant, and Kerr.Uhhohh who was that MAN on the sideline... ...PHIL JACKSON ? Yes it was. He is the key to sucsess for those Los Angeles Lakers.
