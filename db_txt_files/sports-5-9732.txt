Yeah some f*cked up sh*t happened this season with the celts and shifting players around. And hey, i'd rather pull my finger nails off one at a time then see mihm f*ck stuff up. But you know what? Some exciting stuff is happening... Peirce is exciting alone, ricky davis is coming along to be a great player and my prediction for next year is that it will be the year of Banks. Banks is a fast player who is going to be one of the best point gaurds in the league (and his defense is amazing). Chucky Atkins for that f*ck up james? excellent. The only thing left is finding a way to get rid of waltah and mihm.
