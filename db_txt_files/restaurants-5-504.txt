Wendy's has great hamburgers, chicken sandwiches, and awesome french fries. They have a great variety of food choices including salads, baked potatoes, chili and lots of other things. They also have a delicious frozen desert called the Frosty. Wendy's is very clean and their food is inexpensive and of high quality.
