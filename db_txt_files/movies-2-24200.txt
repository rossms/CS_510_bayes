Another movie which attempts to address a heavy topic, this time: at what point does artificial intelligence become human (rather acquire 'consciousness'). Too bad that it failed miserably to make an interesting point. It was rather predictable throughout, and of the tear-jerking (bad) kind. Maybe it's something to show your kids on a rainy afternoon, but the question of artificial intelligence is not explored to an extent that such a topic and conclusion warrant.
