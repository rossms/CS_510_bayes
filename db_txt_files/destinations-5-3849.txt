A great city, kind of far from everywhere else. this city has a real heart and an energy that few other prairie cities have. People are very friendly, and have a great deal of civic pride. Edmonton is also a very clean city unlike Vancouver (what a pit!) they have nice mountains though. Don't go to the mall, it is a mall for gods sake! Come for the summer festivals they are out of this world!
