I have tried other kinds of chew, but nothing else comares to the grizz wintergreen. If you hate the taste of regular tobacco, I strongly suggest trying the wintergreen. Personally, the other brands out there aren't as good. Plus, if you don't like the taste of tobacco, it is very likely that you will get sick off of it. Trust me, I know. Oh, and never chew fine cut snuff after a long night of drinking, b/c it will come back up in a hurry.
