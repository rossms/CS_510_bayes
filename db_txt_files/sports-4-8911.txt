I think Korver is a pretty good ballplayer. Everybody knows he can shoot the ball, and his presence on the court alone is enough to create space for AI to get to the basket. I don't think it's an accident that AI had his best year with Korver in the starting line up. While he's not the quickest guy, he is an excellent help defender and gets his hands on a lot of passes. Definitely a building block for the Sixers - I hope he still gets his minutes under Cheeks.
