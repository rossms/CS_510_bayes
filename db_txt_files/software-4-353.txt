It's a HUGE improvement over the old Windows systems (so far)--I haven't had a problem using it yet (though it seems a little too user-friendly sometiems). I've had no crashes using XP. My friends who have used Win. ME and XP ALL absolutely hate ME and can live with XP. It seems to run a lot smoother than previous versions (so far), so I don't have much to complain about yet.
