I have the demo, but not the real game and i've read alot of things about it. All i have to say is buy this game! Being a fan of Metal Gear, i have to say that Konami and Hideo Kojima have been working hard on this game. Snake has some new tricks and if you thought the first game was hard enough, then i advise you to be careful on this one. The guards are smarter and can spot you by your shadow. If you get hurt, they'll follow your blood trail. You'll have new weapons and they'll be much more because i don't want to give it all away. So don't be stupid, BUY THIS GAME NOW!!!
