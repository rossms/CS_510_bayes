My memories of Arenal are (unfairly) tainted by the fact that I woke up with a scorpion on my pillow next to my ear. To make it worse, i didn't handle it very well. I sprinted outside and slept in the cab of the pick-up truck that had taken me there. And also, it was rainy and foggy so we couldn't see much of the volcano.
