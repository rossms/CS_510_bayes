As far a candy bars go, Kit Kats are pretty much a staple. I usually go for some new kind of candy bar that I haven't tried before, but when all else fails I keep going back to the old Kit Kat. They're also fun to eat because you break off segments at a time, and you can share equally with one or two other people (2 or 3 pieces each). They also have the perfect amount of crispiness.
