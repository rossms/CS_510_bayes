Something about him always reminded me of Huckleberry Hound. Okay, well, I did start to see him in movies at about the same time in my childhood that I was really into Hanna-Barbera cartoons. In spite of his hangdog look it was easy to see that Bogart was a good actor. Mostly cast in serious, dramatic parts, he could still be very funny at times. I especially enjoyed him paired with Katherine Hepburn in The African Queen .
