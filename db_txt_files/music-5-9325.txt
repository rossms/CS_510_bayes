I love Mystikals video Danger . He looks so good in that hot sweater and he looks so good with his braids. He such a great performer. He's my favorite male artist and I would'nt change him for anything. Not even if he did'nt make music anymore, he's still going to be off the hook. He's made a lot of changes in his life and I think he deserves all of our support. For all those haters out there, you don't know what your missing. He's got a lot to say. And I'm listening. Much Love from Worcester Massachusetts
