Top rate professors, students and facilities. First rate education at half the price of the ivys'. By the way it is the only school in the country that had an offer to join the ivy league besides the present members. Want an alumni network? It is the 8th oldest school in the nation(founded in 1766). If you want to go to a top notch school that offers everything, this is the place. You'll have to deal with a loosing football team, which is not much of a tradeoff considering the ivys' football programs.
