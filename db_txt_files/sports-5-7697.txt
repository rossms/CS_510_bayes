Bill Bradley was and still is such a cerebral guy. He offers philosophical analysis about how the game has evolved and changed from his day until today. Bradley was unbelievably great at his small forward position he played on the Knicks during their championship run. He was frowned upon while he was at Princeton for playing a poor and black sport, but he knew basketball was the game he loved and he played it and didn't worry about the whole racial question.
