High quality of life in Vermont peaceful, and low crime with very good schools. Pace of life is perfect, friendly people, non materialistic, pro environment. Great summers and falls. Progressive- tolerant-beautiful scenary. Only real downer are the long winters- global warming is slowly changing that! Brattleboro is very nice, as is Burlington- Bennington and Rutland are so peaceful-with great Main Streets- with Thai Restuarants and Starbucks! Enjoy the mountaims and quiet valley's.
