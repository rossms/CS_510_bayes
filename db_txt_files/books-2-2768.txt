I hate Dr. Laura's guts and especially her often bigoted agenda, but even I have to admit that striving for healthier interpersonal relationships and losing dysfunctional habits is important for most all of us to self-discover. There are better (and more compassionate) authors but I wouldn't dismiss her personal improvement book as unhelpful.
