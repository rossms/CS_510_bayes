I like these a lot. The peanut butter is a bit more candy like than in normal reese's cups - meaning that it is sweeter and doesn't have that slightly crumbly texture. The only downside is that the chocolate tastes a bit weird, I think they should have put a more fudgy consistence in the middle...that would have been heaven.
