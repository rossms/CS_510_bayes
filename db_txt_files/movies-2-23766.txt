When I first watched this, I was expecting to be blown away by all the effects. Instead, I was blown away by the hype. It wasn't nearly as good as some people would have had me believe. It's way too long and the story was underdeveloped. You'd think in over two and a half hours they would have corrected that problem, but no. The characters, for the most part, aren't very likable either. It's one of those movies where you never really have any doubt how it's gonna turn out.
