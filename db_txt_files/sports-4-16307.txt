At one time, Freeman was the best reciever in football, but his numbers and his attitude has regressed recently. He's big and physical, he'll push off and muscle his way free. He is excellent after the catch. He's only 4.6 on a fast day, so he won't win many footraces. Cover corners who walk up on him can shut him down. When he runs under control, he can use his speed the best he can. Another consideration is his bad attitude last season.
