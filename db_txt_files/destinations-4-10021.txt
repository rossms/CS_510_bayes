I like the coolness inside me after smoking Marlboro Menthols. For that reason, I prefer to smoke it in the summer. But the point is that most cigarette smokers I know don't like to smoke menthol cigarettes as their permanent choice. I think the reason is the flavor of menthol. It doesn't give the smoker the feel of smoking a cigarette of pure tobacco, because the mint flavor covers the flavor of tobacco.
