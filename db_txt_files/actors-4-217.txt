A good actor but tended to be an extremely intense one. When I think of him in most of his roles, my mind conjures up this cartoon-like visage - triangular, muscular, jerky movements and a perpetual smile full of gleaming teeth. Burt chewed more than his share of scenery and sometimes went a tad over the top but usually put in a memorable performance regardless.
