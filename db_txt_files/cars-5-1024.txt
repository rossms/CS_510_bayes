I own a 2001 Toyota Camry LE, 4 cyl. I love the car very much. I like the comment by liddlebopeep about having an exciting lemon hot rod over a boring dependable car. The Camry will keep going and going and going. Wondered at first whether the 4 banger would have enough power. Emphatically yes, the 4 banger has plenty of zip! I am into environmental issues all the time and driving a car that was environmentally friendly was important too. We need to strive to insist that our government pushes laws to make sure that car manufacturers make fuel efficient vehicles! So yes, I am very happy with my Toyota Camry!
