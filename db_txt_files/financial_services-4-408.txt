I hate to say it, but I have had a very good experience Paine Webber's full-service broker service - so much so, that it has prevented me from taking the plunge to online trading. My agent took the time to learn the kinds of companies that interest me, my risk level, etc, and has consistently made recommendations which I have been happy with - and more importantly, have performed.
