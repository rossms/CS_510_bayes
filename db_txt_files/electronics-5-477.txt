I bought the MZ-R55 eight years ago. The thing keeps going and going, even though it's been dropped a few times. The sound quality is remarkable; I've recorded some amazingly studio-sounding music with good mikes and a small mixing board. Sony's audio equipment (and video equipment) are without parallel.
