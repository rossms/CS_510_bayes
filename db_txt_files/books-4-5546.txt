I gave this book a good rating. It was the story of a teenage boy left to raise his younger sisters in some desperate circumstances. The book was well written and I felt compassion for the main character. This book is not for those who become offended by course language and and sexual references. There are some definate hints in this book at an incestuous relationship between the main character and his younger sister.
