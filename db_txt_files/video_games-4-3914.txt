The only innovative game in the series, Tomb Raider brought adventure games into 3-D, in a setting for more mature and immersive people than Nintendo's surreal characters. It's still the only Tomb Raider I own, and the imagination and innovation that went into the level design is still exceptional. I can still remember the first time I saw the T-Rex, and the panic I felt when trying to find a place to hide the character. I sympathized with her.
