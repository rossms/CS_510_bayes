The Accord is an excellent sedan, based on my experience with a 1994 Accord (traded it in on a CR-V in 2002). Never had any problems with it for 8 years. Almost bought a 2005 Accord, but my wife didn't like it as much as the 1994 as far as visbility and seat comfort for her went, so we ended up with a Ford Five Hundred. I'd recommend Honda products to anyone.
