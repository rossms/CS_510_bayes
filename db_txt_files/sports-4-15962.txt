That Magellan guy said that nobody knows who Corey Dillon is??? Yeah, if you don't follow the NFL maybe. Dillon is not what he once was, and now that he's made an ass out of himself on t.v. by showing what a classless act he has been all along, he has virtually made himself worthless as far as a good trade that would be beneficial for both the team and his family. Now the Bungles will be lucky to get a 5th-round draft pick for this sarcastic bastard.
