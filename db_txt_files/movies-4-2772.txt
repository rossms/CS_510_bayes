strangely, i found this to be an extremely entertaining movie. i felt that all three leading ladies were equally strong, and whoever the guy who played the villain, i felt he did a stupendous job playing two opposite parts. it was action packed and colorful, and the soundtrack was fun. i won't remember it in a month, but it was a good watch.
