I drink this stuff whenever I go out usually mix it with Red Bull if i'm out for the night - gives me enough stamina to last. A nice refreshing alternative is Vodka, Cranberry & Soda. Smirnoff tastes the best, not as harsh on the symthetic taste as some other brands. This is the leading brand in the UK. The pre-mixed alcopops are pretty damn good too.
