A VERY moving film about the holocaust, it touches on a lot of different aspects of that topic with an almost documentary-like feel. A little slow going at parts, a big long, but definately worth watching once. Contains many graphic images, so if you're sensitive to that, you might want to take that into account when watching this film.
