I have owned this truck for about 4 months. I am completely satisfied with every aspect of this truck! The fuel economy is great...17 city, 20.6 highway. I have owned several Fords and will NEVER go back! I cannot believe anyone would even consider an import when this American Quality exists. I hope anyone considering a new truck will please drive one of the new Chevy's...you'll be IMPRESSED!!
