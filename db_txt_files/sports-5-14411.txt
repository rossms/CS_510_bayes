ludacris to say he isnt in the top five! personally he is #1 to me, the passer rating says it all. for all you fools who say he just dumped off 3 yard passes to the backs to boost his completion %, look up who has the highest yard average in the history of the nfl, then talk to me, oh yeah did i mention that he could run too.
