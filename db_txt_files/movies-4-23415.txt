I very much enjoyed this movie. Wonderful to look at and it didn't take itself too seriously. Being obscure, the best little bit of that movie is when Korbin Dallas turns the tables on the ingenious but tightly wound mugger with that clever hat with the photo of the hallway on top. The way he speaks and that crazy little dance that he does when Willis' character gets the drop on him made me laugh so hard and so long it was the first time I was hushed in a theatre.
