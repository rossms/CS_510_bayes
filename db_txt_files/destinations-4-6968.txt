I lived here for a couple of months and while I enjoyed the city, I got a little tired of both the high prices for food and the constant onslaught of pickpockets. Keep your cash in a money belt or somewhere safe. Termini station offers great people watching, Trevi Fountain is amazing. Eating gelato and sitting at Trevi Fountain was one of those zen moments in my life. There's history in every nook and cranny of the city.
