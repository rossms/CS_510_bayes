I have a 97 Royal and would not have another bike. I cant even imagine riding another. I have no bad things to even mention. Its a great bike. Yamaha needs to learn how to market bikes and it would be a very strong seller. Its superior to any Harley in EVERY way. Too bad Harly guys are so close minded. They dont know what they are missing out on. I guess the like cleaning up oil leaks all the time!
