Sorry TMack, but Peyton is easily better than Brady. Brady does have great poise and all of that, but really hasn't put up impressive numbers, which would be required if I were to make him a 5. He does have great leadership, so I'd say he's an easy 4, though. UPDATE: Well, this year Brady lead the NFL in passing yards [4,110] while having a pretty solid QB Rating [92.3]. He may not have got the Pats to the SuperBowl, but I was more impressed by him personally than I had ever been. I don't think I have an excuse not to rate him a 5 now, even with his horrible 4 INT performance I watched against the Chiefs.
