Maine is a nice little state to visit, and there are some things that you can fins here. Some great shopping. Lots of warm, small little shoppies selling homemade candies and candles. Not too many amusement spots here, but some really nice parks. The food is another situation. You won't find too many McDoanlds out here, but lots of homestyle cooking places like Cracker Barrel.
