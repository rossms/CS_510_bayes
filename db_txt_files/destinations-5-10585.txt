These cigarettes don't only taste good but bring back fond memories. They are so light and at the butt of the cigarette there is extra room (if you have ever smoked one, you'd understand but I don't know how to explain it) which I really like for some reason. Anyways, my friend from Washington DC used to smoke these and introduced me to them in college. I always bummed off her. We would sit on our porch and smoke cigarettes talking for hours. It was so fun and they always make me think of that. Parliaments are great cigarettes but they are really uncommon in California.
