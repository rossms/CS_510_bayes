I think the fist Blair Witch Project was scary. For the people that didn't like it, they are obviously not scared easily or at all. People wanna say it was not scary because oyu never see anything...like you know something was chasing them, but you never see it....well that's the point, ya know?? That's what made it scary...the presence of something...you never see it, but you don't know when its gonna be right around the corner. It's not knowing what to expect next that makes it scary!
