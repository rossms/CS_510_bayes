Theyre the best team in the land. And what amazes me is how they still manage to win while shooting free throws worst than Shaquille Wallace(Shaq and Ben Wallace Combined). They can execute very well and play great defense.Excelling at one end of the court is one thing, but dominating both offense and defense is the definiyion of a great team.
