This original 4 player shooting game destroyed when it first came out. Awesome graphics poured with exciting game play makes this game really fun. Its 4 player mode is sick as it makes you trap and obliterate your opponents. The choice of weapons you get are unstoppable when you receive the codes. On my top 10 list.
