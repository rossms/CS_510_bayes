I must admit I purchased this album for track #6-Californication, but was very pleasantly surprised at the quality of almost every song on the record. Each and every song delievers nothing but quality from RHCP. This is by far the best CD in my collection. You can pretty much play this album over and over without tiring from it. With hits like 'Otherside' and 'Scar Tissue' this album is by far RHCP's best yet.
