The Braves have turned to the second most hated team behid the Yankees. Only because they win so much during the season and then lose in the playoffs. The Braves biggest trouble is that they have so many players that know during the season that they are good and given time they will win more then they will lose. These same players have trouble adjusting to win now not latter philosiphy needed for the playoffs
