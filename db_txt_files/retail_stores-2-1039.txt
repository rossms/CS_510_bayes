Abercrombie used to have some nice clothes but something weird has happened to their company in the past few years. I guess I am too old to appreciate their new marketing campaign and their new look and feel. Plus I teach on a college campus and am frequently nauseated when half of my students come in adorned in the A F label. I hate all clothing companies that thrive off their brand like that; I just want comfortable, good looking clothes.
