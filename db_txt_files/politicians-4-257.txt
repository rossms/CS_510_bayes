Son and successor of Alfred the Great. United Wessex and Mercia under his rule. He conquered the Danelaw (Viking held territory of England centering around their five fortified strongholds: Derby, Leicester, Lincoln, Nottingham and Stamford). Higly effective military commander, concidered to have surpassed his father.
