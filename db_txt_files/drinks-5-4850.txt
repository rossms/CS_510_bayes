There are so many different kinds of rootbeer that sometimes it's hard to distinguish one from another since it's all the exact same drink. However, if I had to distinguish something about this rootbeer, it would be that it tastes more creamy, and has a smooth taste to it. It's really good. It's classic in a root beer float, especially in the summer.
