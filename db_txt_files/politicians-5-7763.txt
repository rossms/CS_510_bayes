Look, read the biography of this man (try Willard Stern Randall). If it was not for him there would be no US of A. You really can't say that about any other president (maybe Lincoln, but he led the war from the White House as a politician not a warrior and the worst case would have been a divided counrty). He put his vast fortune on the line for his political beliefs (which coincided with his wealth interests, so what) and fought and led a rag-tag war that often seemed impossible, but he never gave up. It would have never been won without him. There really is no one else in his league.
