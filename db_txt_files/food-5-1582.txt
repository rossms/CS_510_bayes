Skittles are great. Tasting the Rainbow speaks for itself. The variety makes every bite worth it. 50 cents for a pack, and the amount given also plays a factor. You could eat one by one or a handful, and it will still taste as great. New Skittles evolved from different packages, variety to a whole new look and taste (the sour Skittles). Two of the best of both worlds. A sweet, mouth-watering taste.
