The least enjoyable of all the Star Wars movies is still a good one, but where the others have Death Stars, trade Federation battleships and massive clone armies, this one merely focuses on Darth Vader and Chicken Walkers. The characters interact well together and the special effects are good, especially on the Battle of Hoth. Segments with Yoda trudge along, however. Great soundtrack, as can be expected.
