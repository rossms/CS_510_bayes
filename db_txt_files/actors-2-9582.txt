Here in the UK, she started to get famous in the TV series 'Darling Buds of May'. I dont know what happened after she moved to the states. Either she got corrupted by Hollywood or she now shows her true colours. Whatever, she's lost that freshness that made her such as babe in 'Buds' and turned into a greedy, tactless, golddigging bitch from hell. Occasionally she comes back to the UK and on TV interviews does the 'I'm just an ordinary girl from the Valleys' spiel. Smell the coffee Catherine, this kind of bogusness doesnt wash.
