Krispy Kreme are the best, take it from Jorgan Von Stingle! The donuts are so fresh and creamy and delicious. GLAZED DONUTS RULE! Don't go to Dunkin' Donuts. KRISPY KREME is purely the most awesome eating establishment ever. I have eight KK T-shirts, three hats, a hoody, plus I work there! The boxers are awesome and comfy as well. In fact, I'm wearing them right now. AHHHHHH!
