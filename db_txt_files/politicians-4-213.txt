He recovered all his father's gains and managed to drive out Eric Bloodaxe from Northumberland by sheer force of intimidating his people (which was no mean feat, Eric was a Viking who was too bloodthirsty even for the Vikings!). Often Saxon kings have been intimidated by the sheer primal force called the Vikings, Edred certainly wasn't when he invaded them and ravaged their lands. Evidently a tough and fearless monarch which is all the more impressive given his personal sickliness.
