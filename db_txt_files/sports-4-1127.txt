The recent incident at Fenway was a disgrace, and the Red Sox response in pulling the so called fan's season tickets is exactly right. Sheffield, somewhat to my surprise showed remarkable restraint, in not turning the incident into a Ron Artest style brawl. On a career note, Sheffield is a good, if erratic hitter, and something of a headcase. An adequate if not spectacular fielder.
