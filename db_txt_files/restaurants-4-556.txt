Donuts are not my favorite thing, but Krispy Kreme has a good distinct taste that surpasses other donuts. It also melts to your tongue as it feels as if it just came out of the oven. I could not eat too many in one sitting, because they are so sugary, but I recommend them. It is interesting that this company has not spent a dime on their advertising! It has all been by word-of-mouth!
