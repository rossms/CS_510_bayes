This is the crack-cocaine of PC games. Once you start it, prepare to get sucked into a huge time sink-hole of drawing paths, setting queues, building food fairs and stretching roller coasters to their limit. The interface is clean and intuitive, and the progressing missions are varied enough to keep you interested through the sometimes dauntingly long play times. Get this game and kiss your social life goodbye.
