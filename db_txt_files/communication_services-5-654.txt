I love my Cingular Plan. I've used well over 2000 minutes in the first month I got my phone and the month isn't even over. I persoanly am on the Nation plan. Great Coverage, Good Call Quality, Very Affordable. It's been worth my money. I got my phone from my local agent. You can also find phones and plans on cigular.com too. The website is very helpful.
