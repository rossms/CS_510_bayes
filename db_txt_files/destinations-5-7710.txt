As a bostonian, i feel privelaged to have been able to go to friendly fenway lots of times. Ther's nothing like it. Even regular season games have an energy and intensity unmatched by other stadiums even in the world series! everything tastes better at fenway. The dogs, the beer, the ice cream bars. If you never get to go to fenway before it gets torn down or whatnot, you were cheated out of the experience of a lifetime.
