HK is the greatest shopping city in the world. I bought hand-made suits, eyeglasses, etc. Everything I bought in HK has held-up well. The people are friendly, and enough speak English to make touring easy. We took a Star ferry tour of the Harbor with another couple we meet on our tour. We were the only people on a huge ferry and were treated like royalty. The view of the skyline from Kowloon rivals the NYC skyline. My wife and I never felt unsafe in HK.
