The bartender at the local club suggested I try VooDoo Rum instead of my usual Captain n' Coke. Well, not only did I love it, but I completely switched over to VooDoo. I tried them side-by-side with my friends, and all of them agreed that VooDoo was way smoother and just tasted better. I would say try this over Captain Morgan's any day.
