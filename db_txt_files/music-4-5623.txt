The ONLY good CD that can be purchased by this rock band. The rest of their work is rarely worth listening to. But Appetite for Destruction is one of those albums that everyone should have in their CD collection for trips downs memory lane. Axl Rose sounds particularly good in Welcome to the Jungle, which is also their best song.
