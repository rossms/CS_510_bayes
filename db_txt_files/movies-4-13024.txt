Read the book, the movie left a bunch of stuff out that is fascinating. Yes, part 2 helped to fill in what the first movie left out from the book, but it still wasn't enough. I read the book first (yes, I'm probably the only 35 year old who didn't see this movie until 1999) because it was assigned in my criminology class. After I read the book, I rented the movie and was really disappointed. If you thought Michael's relationship with his Sicillian wife was intense from the movie, just read the book. The movie didn't give it nearly enough passion and intensity.
