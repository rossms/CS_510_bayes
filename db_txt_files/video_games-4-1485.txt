I had been a while since I had boughta fighting game. The genre was stale to me for a while (that is until melee came to town). With all the different types of match-ups and difficulty levels you can set, it may be the greatest multiplayer game of all time (Goldeneye for 64 another fav.). Always great for when you and the buds get together. Another plus for this game is many characters (and many secret characters and stages to unlock....although it's sometimes ridiculous what a person has to go through to unlock them....ex. - Falco - 100 man melee).
