I have had my ranger edge for almost two years now and I am very happy with it. As a firefighter I put my truck through alot more than most people do and I must say this truck has stood up to the challenge very well I would recomend this truck to anyone who's looking for a great dependable pick-up with out the price of a full size you've found your winner.
