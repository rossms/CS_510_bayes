I've gone on a big pretzel kick lately, and Rold Gold pretzels rule. They're definitely the best-tasting, freshest pretzels out there. I like the standard variety, but the new line of flavored pretzels is hard to beat. I've tried the honey mustard and the cheddar flavors, and I recommend them both. It's nice to find a low-fat, relatively healthful snack that tastes great, too.
