The only reason why Napoleon Lajoie is largely forgotten in the annals of history is because he played during an era of the deadball. A graceful-yet-determined hitter, he was among the few to achieve the Triple Crown. Not a flashy player, Lajoie was also an outstanding fielder. But his .422 average in a single season (which has since been topped by the .424 of the great Rogers Hornsby) is likely to stand the test of time in the American League.
