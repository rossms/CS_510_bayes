This place must be owned by the devil himself because people are hooked on there donuts like crack! I saw people waiting in Penn Station, N.Y. for 45 minutes for a shipment of donuts to come in. It's rediculous! However, notice that I gave them five stars... They are the best donuts I have ever had, bar none, hands down, game over. They are simply devine, or perhaps devilish... =o)
