Dreamcatcher, based on the Stephen King novel has an excellent screenplay, but just does not ever click. The actors do try their best, but at no point does it ever make enough sense, or ever engage you in. The characters aren't interesting, and the actors don't have the material to to anything about it. Was it possibly the heavy editing that ruined this film? The book was so superb, but the film is so mediocre. What happened in between? Dreamcatcher cannot be recommended, unfortunely.
