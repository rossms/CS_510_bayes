I was pretty dulled out on this food until my mother came back from Florida one year and told me how good their fish sandwiches are. I figured they must be fairly good considering she had lots of chances to compare seafood during her 4 month stay in sunny Florida. So, I tried one and she was right, they do make a pretty decent sandwich. That kind of reawakened my interest in them, but it's still not a place I visit very often. Oh and BTW: they do seem to use the same breading for just about everything they make but the hush puppies are made out of corn meal Dorkavitch...or at least, I hope they are!
