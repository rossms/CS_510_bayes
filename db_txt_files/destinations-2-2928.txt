Completely overrated. 2 years here and I keep going back and forth between liking it and loathing it. and overall it sucks. i can't wait to get out of here next year. i'm tired of the noise, the trains, the asshole people who get in your way. and please, don't give me any of that you can't take it new york attitude crap. These people need to get a clue. I can take it - i just have a brain and realize there is more to this country than New York and Los Angeles. So let the attitude stay here - at least if all the assholes are on one island, the rest of the country doesn't have to bother with them as much.
