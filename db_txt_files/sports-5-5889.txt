JJ is the best shooter I've ever seen. He has range to half court and is a true scoorer. He is improved so much since his Freshman year and will no doubt make an impact in the NBA for whatever team is lucky enough to pick him up. He lead a DUKE team with basically nobody on the bench to another ACC Championship and took them past the second round. He has a unbelievable talent no matter who you are you can't deny that, just because he plays at Duke then he must be hated i guess
