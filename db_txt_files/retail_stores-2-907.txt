Seen an Abercrombie catalog? Their philosophy is trying to sell clothes by having their models not wear any. Same concept with the billboard on my way to work where the only piece of clothing you can spot is the top of someone's generic tighty whities. Just look at their mall storefront, and you'd think all they are trying to sell is a rotating set of male nipples. If you can get past their advertising, their overbearing logos, and the mega-wrinkled look, I suppose they have some cute designs for teenage sensibilities. It all looks really dang ridiculous on people over 25, though.
