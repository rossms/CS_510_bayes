I like Frosted Mini-Wheats well enough, but their real appeal is in the name. It's evocative and strange -- frosting is something you do to a cake, or it's a woman's hair treatment. But they're applying this treatment to a mini-wheat. What the hell's a mini-wheat, anyway? I'm enticed by the mystery of it all.
