I'm only rating this so high because of what the Mustangs were like many years ago. When I was in college, I had a girlfriend who owned a marroon '65 Mustang. It was already several years old by that time. I got to drive it real often, and it was fantastic - lots of energy, low gas mileage - I'd love to have one just like it today. In fact, that car turned out to be far more reliable and trustworthy than the girlfriend was.
