Continental offers a superior product in their Transatlantic US to UK market. Recently, my family and I flew to the UK under circumstances of a death in the family and we all flew Businessfirst. The crew were kind and attentive, accommodating and sympathetic to our needs. We normally fly over to the UK three times a year, and we consistently use Continental. We will continue to fly Continental for these trips.
