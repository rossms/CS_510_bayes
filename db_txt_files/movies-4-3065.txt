Suprisingly, this was one of the better films I've seen all year. Like many others, I didn't know how enjoyable spending an hour-and-a-half with a guy in a phone booth could be. Kiefer Sutherland was the perfect choice for The Caller with his awesome voice. Colin Farrell also had a great performance. At the beginning, he is so slimy and you really want him to die, but by the end, you realize he has really changed his ways. Forrest Whittaker and Kate Holmes are also really good in their supporting roles. It was a little heavy on the F-bombs, but check this one out if you want a good rental next weekend.
