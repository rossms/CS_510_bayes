t5he worst movie ever other than howard the duck. I don't think it was bad because it wasn't developed; it was very well developed. however it was also a sereis of one bad thing after another, nothing good happened to anyone in this film and the end was the last straw for me, this film left me feeling depressed and hopless, movies have to have some good somwhere, you can't just give people uncurable diseases, have everyone getting shot at and at the end your hero steps on a mine and gets blown to peices
