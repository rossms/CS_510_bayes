For the price nothing beats a 90-96 300zx in quality, and style. The only downside is that while reliable for a sports car, they are expensive/difficult to repair. So while Z's are a performance bargain, if you aren't a do-it-yourself mechanic type you should be prepared for the big $$$ to maintain a 5-10 year old high performance car. So enough of the practical talk, when you are driving a well kept Z, you have top notch performance, in a car that's less common than a 911 or vette. Go buy one.
