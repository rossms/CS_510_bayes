Publix is the best supermarket around.I have worked for them the last four years.Their is a better class of people that shop Publix then Wal-Mart.Wal-Mart puts Five days plus some on there fresh meat products because all the saltwater they put in it to make it last longer.At publix we do not put all that saltwater in are fresh meat to make it last longer then charge you for it.
