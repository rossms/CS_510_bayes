Linux isn't an Operating System, it's a kernel. You really ought to break out the Linux Distros here, so they can be individually rated. That might actually be useful :) Anyway, Linux as a kernel isn't bad, but it's got a long way to go before they can stop work on it. Performance is good, and it has most of the features you would expect, although multiprocessor support and filesystems have a way to go yet. Also, I personally dislike the modular kernel structure, but that's just a matter of taste. Other than that, it scores lots of points for being properly free.
