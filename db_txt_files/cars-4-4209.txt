I am new to this message board and bought a 2004 MPV 3 months ago. I have 4200 miles on it and NOW all of a sudden, I am getting very bad odors when I first open the car up (smell like dirty diapers) and I also get a rotten egg smell when I first turn off the car. I NEVER noticed this problem until about 2 weeks ago and I have read today that some other people have this problem. I don't see a solution to this problem. What worked for you all? Am I stuck in a stinky? Thanks so much! ' Tracy
