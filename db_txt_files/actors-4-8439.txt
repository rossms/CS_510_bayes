Marilyn Monroe was more than just a pretty face. She was a very gifted comedic talent. You can find ample proof of this in Some Like It Hot Seven Year Itch. Her drama skills were good and steadily improving...as can be seen in Don't Bother To Knock, Bus Stop The Misfits. She also pulled off mystery/noir fairly well in Niagra. It's a shame that the studios didn't give her more shots at the serious roles she craved. We'll never see how good she could have been, as her smile and walk left her desperately stereotyped.
