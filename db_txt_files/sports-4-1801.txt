being from a city in this teams division--they make me jealous. first, they play in an ashtray shaped stadium. second they're as on and off as any other team, and third they come from a relatively average city--yet their fans are mad for them!! never have a seen a city go after it's baseball team w/heart and support like St. Louis does for it's red birds. it's hard not to like them. and that includes the history. knowing that players such as Lou Brock, Stan Musial, Bob Gibson, Keith Hernandez, and Ozzie Smith have all worn a cardinal jersey just adds to their legend.
