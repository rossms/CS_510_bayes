The only reason they got the second star was because of Mariucci. They have a promising young quarterback with a quality backup runningback, a couple of receivers with speed but no major impact yet, and a defense with a few young stars. I predicted a .500 season last year, but I was way off. This year, I'm saying they win 6, including 1 against the Bears. COME BACK BARRY.
