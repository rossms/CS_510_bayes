I pity the 99.9% of the World's population who don't live in London ! We have evrything you could possibly need - theatre, music, castles, palaces, museums, history - did you know Queen Boudicca died on platform 10 at King's Cross Station ? Wait, on the other hand - you don't want to come here and clutter up my beautiful city with tourists - how about Paris ????
