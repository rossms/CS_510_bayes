We saw this as a family today. Nice movie.'Tim Burton did a good job about a dad who loves to tell big Fish stories about his life. His grown son has grown tired of them and does not believe any of it. he is embarrassed by his dad's stories.we see the dad as a younger man as he goes through is life with the stories he says his life was like. well played by Ewan McGregor as the young version and Albert Finney as the older Edward.we find out at the end if his stories are true, somewhat true or whoppers.very charming and imaginative story telling.
