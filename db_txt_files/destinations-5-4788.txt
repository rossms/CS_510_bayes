I never faced the problems that I know exist in Rio and I was in all over the city. It helped perhaps I stayed with my Brazilian ex's family, but still it was a wonderful experience. Rio is a breathtaking city. It was actually never my destination of choice but when I landed in Rio it really hit me. Yes, Brazil has it's problems like any other big city. But the culture, the people and the great food; just a treasure of a time. The best time of the year to really go to Rio is actually in it's winter. It's tropical but still a pleasant place to be.
