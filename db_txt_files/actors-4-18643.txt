I thought Traffic was extremely well-done, due in large part to the directing as well as the great individual acting performances (particularly by Benicio del Toro). And Erin Brockovich was OK, although I don't consider it Oscar-worthy. Out of Sight - less well known than those first two Soderbergh films - is actually pretty good, too. Soderbergh seems to be improving over the years, and, if Traffic is any indication, we should be seeing even better films from him in the future.
