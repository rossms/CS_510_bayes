A very good movie. I know that they made part of it long and drawn out so that we would get a feel for how Hanks was feeling on the island, it was hard not to fall asleep during that but the emotions and frustrations of a man trapped alone on an uninhabited island was excellent. The airplane crashing scene was terrifying and Hanks taking care of his own dental work was grusome and sickening but it all added to the movie. I think it was very realistic down to Hanks choosing Wilson for a companion-anything rather than to be alone. Tom Hanks rarely lets me down-I give the movie a 4 and Hanks a 5.
