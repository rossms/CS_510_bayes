By far Canada's top unveristy, need I say more? Diveristy of the student, top professers, wide-range of courses, beautiful campus and amazing location. McGill has it all, obvious it has a few flaws because nothing is perfect but that's life. It may take longer to get an advising appointment and students may be encouraged to do things on their own but it prepares you for the real world. McGill is competitive but so is the marketplace. McGill is an institution of higher learning, it's survival of the fittest at McGill, if you don't make the cut then you don't dererve to graduate with a McGill degree.
