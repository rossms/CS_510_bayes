I have friends that claim that -to them- Mountain Dew tastes like piss water. While I can understand why they'd think that, it doesn't to me, in fact it's my fav. soda and NOT because of the caffeine, but because of the taste, alone. It's the best tasting lemon lime soda pop. Beats the hell out of 7up and Sprite.
