I give it a 5/5 because i can't give it a 4.5/5. This an awesome game, there are many new tricks and weapons compared to The Ocarina of Time. The are many different sides of gameplay and the interaction between the character and the world itself is simply amazing. If you liked The Ocarina of Time then you will love this one.
