I am knocking on wood right now. I've had my Cirrus almost four years (purchased when it was one year old, it's a 1998). Not one problem with it. I have kept up on the standard maintenance (oil change, tune up, etc.) - it's a great car. I had someone back into me recently, the impact was pretty bad, but I was surprised the damage wasn't that much. It took it pretty well. I'm very satisfied with this vehicle.
