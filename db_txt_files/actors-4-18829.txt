James Cameron has a great talent for knowing what the audience wants. His style is classic and his visual flair is very precise and clean cut. Titanic, no matter how much I say I didn't like it, was a a spectacle to behold and very fine tuned.He likes to put his heart in front of the brain. I might not love all his films, but he is great at what he does as a director. That is what we are rateing right? The director, not his films. Very fine director.
