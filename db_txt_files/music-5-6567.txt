Crush is full of energy. Brings me back to a slippery sort of feeling. Just older and Next 100 years have to be my favorite. I go see them every chance i get they are GREAT in concert. I was lucky enough to win tickets to there show at the China Club and let me tell you ive never been to a better show or have been as close to the band. I will never forget that show!! Keep it up guys...
