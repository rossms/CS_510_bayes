This movie is completely driven by the relationship between Robert DeNiro and Charles Grodin, and the two make a great team. In most cases DeNiro plays the straight man, with Grodin using his typical dry, deadpan wit to play off DeNiro's more serious character. I thought Grodin was funny in Seems Like Old Times as the uptight husband of Goldie Hawn, but this movie really made me a fan - he's got some classic lines and his sarcastic delivery is perfect.
