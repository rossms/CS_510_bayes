Shaq's been named one of the best players in the history of the game by many, many basketball critics in many magazines. That should say enough. 3 rings in a row should speak for itself also. He's the most dominant player ever. No one can single handly gaurd him. The best post player in the game right now and has great ball handling skills. His free throw shooting is pretty bad, but every player has a weakness, so oh well. But he's about to get his 4th ring in about a month, so, there ya go.
