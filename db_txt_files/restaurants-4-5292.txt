Let me first say Chi Chi's is out of business, they are no more, history, filed for Bankruptcy protection last year and then couldn't come back from that Green Onion food poisoning incident where a number of people died in Pennsylvania. The company that owns Outback, Carrabas bought them out and now own all their assets so where a Chi Chi's once was will now probably be an Outback or Carrabas or something else or nothing. The only thing I ever ordered at Chi Chi's was their Fajitas, they were good and this place was way better then Taco Hell or On the Border.
