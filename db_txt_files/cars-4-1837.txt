I would give the LHS an OK ...but it gets a Good just because it's such a stylish car. I have had a number of small annoying problems however. Right now my LHS's interior lights keep intermittently coming off and on, for no apparent reason. I've had a couple of computer problems related to the engine...but fortunately most of the problems I've had have been covered by the warranty.
