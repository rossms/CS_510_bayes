A very good movie. Excellent visual/special effects. A very interesting and different way to perceive death in our culture and society. The movie starts off good, but by the middle to the end, it starts getting sappy. A little too family oriented for a movie about death. I must admit though, the idea of being able to do whatever you want when dead is attractive.
