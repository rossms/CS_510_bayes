California is still a terrific state, but I think that its share is falling. It is simply too crowded. San Diego remains pretty nice, but Los Angeles is a smoggy, traffic-clogged mess and San Francisco is becoming too expensive for anybody to consider living in. In between is some beautiful scenery, but it's rapidly getting choked with traffic and quaint towns as well. Only the northern part of the state is spared, and by then you might as well be in Oregon. It's a pretty state, and has a lot to recommend it - but it's terribly overrated.
