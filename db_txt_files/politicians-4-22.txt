I'm not really a fan of the Royals, but I will defend my country still having them. The Royal Family are a living part of Britain for thousands of years now and do represent Britain internationally. It actually doesn't cost the taxpayers much annually to support the Royal family and they do own companies in order for them to support themselves. If America had the same, I'm sure that you wouldn't see it as a waste of money.
