Gothic, dark, evil, fun. This isn't bad at all. I personally liked it although I didn't like Casper or Christian Ricci's character. (I did like the ghastly trio and Ricci's father though). Sometimes it seems a little bit stupid and not worth the effort, but not a failure by all means. Better than its uninspired sequels. Summary: A DARK YET FUN FILM THAT IS STUPID AT TIMES.
