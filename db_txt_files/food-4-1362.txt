I'm not a fan of dark chocolate usually but its the best choice for Junior Mints. Mint and chocolate go hand in hand, they are so good together and while most choco-mint candy has a tangy mint flavor, junior mints have a sweet creamy mint filling. Were they to be coated in milk chocolate, the candy would be too sweet and the flavors, in my opinion, wouldn't compliment each other as well as they do now.
