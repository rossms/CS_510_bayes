Wasn't Sandler's best. At first I really loved this movie and was obsessed with it. Now that it has been a year ago I did that I now know it's hardly that funny. There are still some parts that are pretty funny. Sandler could've done better than that and I'm not really a huge fan of Sandler. Big Daddy, Billy Madison, and Happy Gilmore are the best Sandler films that are fun to watch.
