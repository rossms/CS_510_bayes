Just a step up from McDonald's and just a step down from a full service resturant. A nice middle of the road place. Great Breakfasts. A nice place to visit while on a road trip, but hardly worth writing home about. It fills it's niche in the resturant world nicely. The prices are good, and the staff is always friendly and helpful. A nice place for a quick lunch or supper after a ball game, but hardly approriate for a romatic outing.
