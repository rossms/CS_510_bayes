It was a respectable movie. Surprisingly, DiCaprio did a good job as the main character. Classic great actors Christopher Walken and Tom Hanks are also splendid. The motion picture is a good saga of a man defrauding banks throughout the country and eventually the world. Unfortunately, as with most movies, a love subplot occupies too much of the film. Otherwise, I recommend it to see in the theater or rent it when it comes out in stores.
