I thought I had rated this long ago but apparently not. In any case, just read what Errol had to say about it. I agree totally...It was really good, but his second book, See, I Told You So was better. And really, it should only be rated on here by people who have read it. After all, I didn't write anything about Hillary's book until I went through it myself.
