Although this video is pretty tame compared to today's standards, when it came out, this was huge. And leave it to Madonna to be the one to push everyone's buttons with it... she's a great artist and a great businesswoman for being able to provoke such controversy with a 4 minute song and video. It's a great video and explored subject matters other artists were too timid to do themselves. Even to do this day people are still scared over religion and whatnot. Keep shocking us and rock on, Madonna.
