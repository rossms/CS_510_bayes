Good place for chicken sandwiches, their chicken is actually in the shape of a chicken breast, not a processed square! I do wish they'd put more than just pickles in their main sandwich, but I love their waffle fries. If you're looking to get a hamburger, this obviously isn't for you. It's a pretty good, healthier alternative to the normal fast food, if that's what you're looking for. It's different, at least.
