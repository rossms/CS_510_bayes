I really liked London it's a beautiful city with tons of stuff to do and see. However, if I were to go back now I would try and go in the off season (for tourism), I just couldn't stand the endless sea of tourists moving through the city, I found it really depressing it was like a theme park. I look forward to going back when I have the time to see it all and not feel overwhelmed by the crowds.
