I spent a semester of college studying in Norwich which is two hours norhteast of London. England is a truly magnificent country. It has one of the best cities in the world, beautiful countrysides, and true university towns. British Rail is tremendous and you can move about the county with ease. It also doesn't hurt that they speak English.
