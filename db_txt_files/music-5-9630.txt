This album and like a prayer are lyrically and music--wise the best albums madonna has put out. If you study the Kabbalah, or any other mysticism you can hear how it directly influenced madonna on this cd. But no one should take madonna in-depthness too seriously b/c she is and has always been first and foremost a power--hungry buisness woman and second an artist. But back to what i was saying, This cd is awesome. too very big thumbs up!!!!!1
