Is the lovely place i've ever seen! Old streets, old churchs, Mirabell Gardens, Mozart's houses... i stayed there for 7 days and it seemed only 1 or 2! Trudly, it's a very beautiful city, and if you go there and want, there is an old convent that is now a "cervecer√≠a", where you can drink good beer in 0,5 l. glasses (a good form to celebrate and finish this visit. Fiesta!)
