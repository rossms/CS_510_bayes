A must see for anyone interested in the Cuban Missile Crisis. The movie apparently stays pretty factual throughout - and it is chilling to see how close we came to nuclear war. The acting was good, the storyline is of course riveting (as it is true), and Thirteen Days is all in all a very good movie.
