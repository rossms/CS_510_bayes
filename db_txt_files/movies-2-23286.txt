This was bad. It tried to be a Sci-Fi movie but failed. It put in too much science and not enough believable fiction. The characters were wooden and had no depth. The love story that underlaid the plot was unbelievable. There was no depth to the movie even. I ended up not believing she'd make contact, and I beleive in ET.
