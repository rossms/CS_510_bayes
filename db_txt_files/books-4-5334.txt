A very good read. Unlike pretty much any book I've read, Bel Canto is a story about a group of elite businessmen from around the world, held hostage in the mansion of some Latin American vice president. The terrorists take control of the gathering very early on (w/in the first 30 or so pages), leaving the large majority of the book to the social aspect of the hostage situation as it developed. Roxane Coss, an operatic 'genius' is among those in custody. The skillful way Patchett describes the beauty of Coss's voice in Bel Canto almost made me feel guilty for not being an opera fan.
