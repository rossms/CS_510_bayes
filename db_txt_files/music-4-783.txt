Loved Tidal, and wasn't disappointed by any of the material from When the Pawn... If anything, it's grittier, meatier, and a little more grown-up. This CD is all Fiona...I think she even wrote and composed every song, which is absolutely phenomenal considering how young she is. The writing is fabulous...the words resonate...my favorite song from the CD is Limp.
