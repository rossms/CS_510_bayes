Last year, I signed up for MCI long distance due to their affiliation with Northwest airlines, and good long distance rates. When I moved away and cancelled my service, I asked if I could keep the accompaning calling card at the same low rates. Upon being told yes, I kept it and used it. A month later, I expected a $300 phone bill, but instead I got a bill for $1000! After getting the run around all summer, and being told there was nothing I could do about it, I finally called their headquarters where an understanding woman fixed the problem.
