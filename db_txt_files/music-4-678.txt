I'm not generally a fan of loud, angry music, but I liked NIN's The Downward Spiral, so I gave Fragile a chance and wasn't disappointed. Yes it's loud and angry, but in the right mood I can appreciate it. Trent Reznor, unlike modern hard-rock hacks (e.g., Kid Rock), actually has musical talent. It's dark, tense, and warped, but it's still talent. So if you feel like keeping some music around to provide a background for high-energy brooding, Fragile isn't a bad choice.
