Beautiful, these reefs are stunning. After I worked my butt off for my scuba linese I went to this reef and saw that it was beyond worth it! The water here is like crystal clear, you can see right to the bottom, the many colors of fish were fantastic, liek a rainbow. Its really hard to believe that there is so much under that water, until you go under it in Roaton
