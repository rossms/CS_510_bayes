I love watching Gerry play. He always puts his all into every game. He's such a hustler. I can't help but think that he would've scored a lot more if Edelin was point guard. Being that Syracuse is out of the tournament now, I just want to congratulate them on a great season and I can't wait for next year. Go GMac!
