Wisconsin is a unique mid-western state because it has rolling hills and dense forest and more lakes than Minnesota. Culturally the state has managed to preserve its European heritage better than most. Milwaukee, on Lake Michigan, is perhaps the most American of cities yet has maintained an original and historic feel. With impressive summer and winter getaways in Lake Geneva, Door County, Apostle Islands and the Wisconsin River area, Wisconsin hosts more Chicago vacations than any other state. Overall one of the 15 best states.
