Oh I loooooveee Frisco! For those of you who carp about it...try going to the smog mecca south the the Bay Area. San Franciscans are very nice and friendly. True..there is a lot of political BS going on in SF, raning from protests to pro-Gay parades. To be frank..I don't like the latter. But man, nice scenery,..clean air...great transportation system. I wonder why SF has the BART system and LA doesn't have a freakin' subway system?!!!
