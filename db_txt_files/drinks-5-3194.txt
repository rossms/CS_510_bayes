The prefered gin of author John D. MacDonald's salvage consultant, Travis MaGee, this is a classic British gin. Mix yourself a McGee, or The Drink, as Travis himself described it: Fill two thirds of an ample old-fashioned glass with cracked ice. Pour a big, unmeasured slosh of dry sherry into the glass, then swiftly [strain] it down the drain, reserving the ice. Fill to the ice level with Boodles or Plymouth gin, rub lemon peel around the inside of the rim, pinch some little floating beads of citrus oil on the surface of the drink, and throw away the peel.
