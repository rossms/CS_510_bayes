Not bad. Not bad at all. The fun is back, and once the viewer turns off his/her brain, Ressurection is a super way to kill 90 minutes. The image of Michael Myers stalking himself is wonderfully creepy, and the multiple camera scenario allows for a great deal of fast action. Can't wait for Halloween 9.
