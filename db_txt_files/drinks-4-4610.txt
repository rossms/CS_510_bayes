Contrary to what the previous reviewer said, soft drinks beat tastless, unimaginative water any day of the week! I drink soft drinks on a regular basis and I'm not fat! Coca-Cola isn't as sweet as Pepsi, but its still highly enjoyable. However, its not on sale as often and its logo isn't nearly as cool. Their commercials (with the polar bear, especially) are pretty good on a whole.
