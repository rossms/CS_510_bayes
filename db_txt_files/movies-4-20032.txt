A good movie. Not particularly scary, but a good flick nonetheless. It is interesting the way they flmed it, with the actors not knowing what was coming next. How anyone could think it was real is beyond me. If such lost camper footage was found, securing the rights from the families and survivors would be particularly messy. Highly enjoyable film. The sequals sucked though.
