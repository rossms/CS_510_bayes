The big question, for all looking for speakers. Do you want something that sounds great, or REAL? I do digital recording with my MiniDisc recorder of all sorts of things from music boxes to piano. I then play it back on my Bose. I close my eyes and think does that sound like the piano is in the room with me or am I just playing it back on a stereo. A lot of times it's hard to tell. SO BACK TO THE QUESTION, SOMTHING THAT SOUNDS GREAT, OR REAL?
