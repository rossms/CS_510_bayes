 Celebrity Skin is the first single off of Hole's album Celebrity Skin. I really like this song (as well as Malibu ), and it's one of the few good tracks on the album. Hole's style of music has changed very much after the death of her husband and grunge god Kurt Cobain. The song has good guitar riffs and catchy lines, but the album as a whole pretty much sucks and cannot compare to their old stuff.
