This movie is funny as hell. This is pre dating all the horrible Naked Gun sequels and terrible Leslie Neilson comedy flicks like Mr. Magoo and Spy Hard. This is when people knew what show the movie was based off of. What cracks me up about it even more these days is O.J.'s involvment in the film. The guy is hilarious! Alot of great stupid wacky humor. Well worth watching.
