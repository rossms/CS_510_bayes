Seen her in Disclosure, A Few Good Men and Indecent Proposal. She was good in the first two. Indecent Proposal was a stupid movie, so thumbs down on that. I found her believable. I heard she sucked in Striptease and GI Jane, but I didnt see them so I cant judge. Her body is unbelievable for a 22 year old, nonetheless a 40 year old ( Check out Nov issue of People for proof whereof I speak) Of course I think it is the best money can buy, but she has pushed out 3 little ones, so I salute her whenever I see her.
