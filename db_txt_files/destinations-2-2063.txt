I stayed with a Honduran family once. Honduras is an extremely poor country. You cannot even drive a car in some cities without having small children bang on the windows. Tourists are frequently targeted by pickpockets. I was sexually assaulted in Honduras. Honduran bathrooms are horrible. Cigarette butts everywhere. I am not so fond of Honduras. I had a very bad expierience.
