Well, he probably did play a small part in liberating the black people in South Africa, although I believe the international boycot and political pressure had a much bigger effect. And he managed to get through 5 years as president of SA without doing too much damage. Don't forget that ANC (his old party) is really left wing, though - bordering on communism!
