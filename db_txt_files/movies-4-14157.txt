I thought this movie was pretty good, just because I found the true story very fascinating. I thought it was cool that they made a movie about it, since the real story was on the TV all the time. Hillary Swank did a very good job; it's pretty hard to act like the opposite sex and have people believe you. I thought it was a little far-fetched, but good!
