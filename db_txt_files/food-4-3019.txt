Well, I must say... I really do like these cookies, or at least some varieties of them. The chewy variety are great (especially heated in the microwave). They're nice and soft, good chocolate chips to satisfy! The Chunky are the next best--lots of BIG chunks of chocolate in a not-too-crunchy, not too chewy cookie, for a BIG chocolate taste. The original variety, though... those leave a little something to be desired. They're just plain too hard to enjoy much.
