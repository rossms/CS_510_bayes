There is nothing that Harry Browne says that does not make total sense if one believes we live in a Constitutional Republic. If one feels we live in a socialist or fascist state, then you would find his comments repulsive. Libertarians are for LIBERTY as long as one does not encroach on another person or their property. Otherwise, government should stay out of our lives, only doing what is reqired in the Constitution.
