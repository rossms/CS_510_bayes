If I could possibly rate this game higher, I would. I'm not usually a video game junkie -- in other words, I don't usually sit around playing games on the computer for hours on end. But Call of Duty is a different case. It's so realistic that you feel the fear and tension. The missions are true-to-life and if someone walks into the room when I'm playing, I literally jump 'cause I'm so into the game. Call of Duty is excellent and definitely worth the money.
