I just bought my first bottle of Dalmore 12. I've only been drinking Scotch for about a year or two, but this is the best non-Islay I've ever had. Mild hints of fruit, and a nice touch of oak to the finish. And you can't beat the price (about $32) for this kind of flavor. I've had whiskey that cost twice this much that wasn't as good.
