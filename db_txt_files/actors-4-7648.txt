In the early days of his career there was Bound by Honor which was ethnic and unique but not quite the Latino gangster fest that American Me was.Not as much dramatic clout as Zoot Suit . However it had the distinction of showcasing Mr. Bratt who looked diffeerent in that film than he does now. I think it's a nose differentiation. Either way he's a good looking soul altho' by my count finer with the first nose. His wee cameo in Traffic was well done. He can act some.
