Rated a four by me on their ice cream alone. I have not had anything else from a DQ. I know this DQ just over the border in PA that used to be a Stuckey's. I couldn't bring myself to eat there just on that fact alone. Stuckey's was the absolute worst! DQ has great ice cream, but I like Magic Fountain better. Magic Fountain is the original recipe for DQ!
