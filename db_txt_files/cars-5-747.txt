I use to ride Trek, Garry Fisher bikes. I bought my first Kona Last year. I Love it the suspention is Firm on the accents yet soft on the decents. As far as basic equipment, Kina is second to none. the Shimano breaks and gear system are as good as you can get for the price range. I would recomend the bike to anyone.
