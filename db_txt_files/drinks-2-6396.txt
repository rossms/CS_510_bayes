While I think it is great that diabetics, and people that are trying to watch their weight have the choice of a soft drink with no sugar, this diet soft drink is just bitter ! I will agree that it is crisp, but not in a good way. There are very few diet colas that are worth drinking, and diet coke is not a worthy one...would rather go without if I had no other choice...
