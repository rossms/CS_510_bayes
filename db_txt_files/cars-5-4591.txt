I have put over two-thousand miles on my 2001 Nissan Frontier Desert Runner in the two weeks I have had it, and I love it. Power is excellent, throttle response (on stock air cleaner, mind you) is exceptional. Dealer incentive got me the V-6 for two-hundred more than the plain-jane vanilla model I'd been looking at six weeks earlier. Plus, I started to fishtail on ice/gravel a few days ago, and this was the fastest correcting vehicle I've ever driven. Love it! Cannot say enough about it!
