All of my friends in college, have recently gotten into rock legend Alice Cooper's music. This guy is brilliant and Brutal Planet is probably the best album I have heard in the last few years. The album is moody and heavy. For Alice to be as old as he is, you can't tell it here. I definitely have become a fan, and he is well loved on our campus!
