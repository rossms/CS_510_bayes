With everything people are doing today to try and eat more healthy, I can't believe McDonald's has come a long way. I think it's awful that they use ultra-cheap prices to foist off unnatural food to low-income families. McDonald's may have America's favorite french fries, but they also add some pounds you won't find favorable.
