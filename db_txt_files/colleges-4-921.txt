I am just completing my B/S in Criminal Justice and have had a very good experience at CTU. The instructors were top notch. I have many years of police work under my belt, so the fast pace of the classes was not a problem. However, if you have no criminal justice experience, I would stay away from CTU. It is very fast paced and many students couldn't keep up. No time to really digest the information.
