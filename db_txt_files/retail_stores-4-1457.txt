Generally I find shopping at Meijer a very plesent and enjoyable experience. Product selection is good and inproving in the retail component of the store while the grocery component is second to none. Prices are competitive as well. Wrapping things up is customer service that is very good as compared to other big box stores. Team Members are friendly and helpful. If I had my choice between a Wal-Mart supercenter and a Meijer store, Meijer would be the first place I'd go to.
