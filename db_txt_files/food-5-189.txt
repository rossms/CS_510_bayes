Simply the best. I've loved this stuff since I was 3 years old. Now, as an adult, it still tastes just as good as it did years ago. Not too sweet, and I personally like the way it gets soggy in milk--though it gets mushy fairly easily, it manages to retain its taste, unlike most other cereals. I'm not too wild about Cinnamon Life, though it's still much better than most of the other fare on the cereal aisle.
