I had a great time in Poland. I suggest visiting Krakow. Beautiful old city with castles, etc, Europes largest town's square, pubs, dance clubs, jazz, museums. From their you can visit the mountains of Zakopane, the salt mines. All in the vicinity. Definitely plan to go back. Underrated tourist destination. Alot of history. The University in Krakow is 700 years old. How can you call this country new? Can't speak badly about a country that produced Copernicus, Chopin and Pope John Paul II
