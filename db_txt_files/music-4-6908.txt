Good Cd. If you like Louis Armstrong. there are some of his great songs on here. he had so much talent not only a good musician but he had that unique voice that was only his. I still love the way he sings Hello Dolly. On some of his other albums he did some great duets. especially with Ella Fitzgerald. Louis Armstrong is one of the musicians i think of when I think of Jazz.
