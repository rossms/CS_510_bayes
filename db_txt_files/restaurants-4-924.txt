Subway is a rare example of a chain that has improved its food in recent years. Despite the dorky ad campaign, you actually can get healthy food here... and they now offer alternatives to the white/wheat rubberbread that made me avoid them years ago. Of course there's no comparison to local delis... but between this and other fast food joints, Subway is much better.
