Pakistan is the best and the most beautiful country in the world! Just look at some pictures of Swat and Hunza Valleys. People in other countries give it or anyother country bad ratings mostly because of ignorance. I have never been to India and it is considerd an enemy of Pakistan but it would not be truthful of me to give that country bad ratings just because of that. There are good and bad people in every country and it takes real guts to set your prejudices aside and say the truth!
