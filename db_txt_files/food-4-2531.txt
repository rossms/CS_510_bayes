I feel confident saying the only time I've ever even SEEN a Krackel bar is on Halloween, when I was little. People used to give out those mini-bars (fun size? - what the hell is a fun size?) of Krackel, Mr. Goodbar, etc. I remember thinking Krackel was good, but pretty much just a rip-off of Nestle Crunch.
