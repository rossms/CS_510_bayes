This phone (Cingular version) is awesome, i would suppose would be better than the Motorola Razr v3 because of its capabilities. For one, it's a pda that you can have mp3's on, along with it's qwerty style keyboard and a good camera. Although the good things outweigh the bad, the only bad thing is the $449 pricetag on a 2 year contract.
