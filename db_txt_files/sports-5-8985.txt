Prince Tay Shaun is a monster ! What other player in the NBA blocks and knocks down the Shaq one game, dribbles behind his back twice on the way to the basket the next game, stuffs Kobe 5 games in a row and comes up with key jumpers and stuffs to kill the opposition's rally's ? Holy SH&*$ ! One time, I think I saw him take one step form the arc, go airborne and stuff it in front of the whole Lakers team. He's a freak of nature with those long arms but he's got skills and tons of speed and can play every position on the court. What's he going to be like if he puts on 20 lbs of muscle in the off-season ?
