Here's a secret - the main character and storyline are based on me. I met the girl in NY at 19, she said strike 1 was she made the first move, except she locked me in a closet, not a bathroom. 6 years later I'm in San Francisco for work and she's in Orange County but chance has it that I'll be back in LA next February. Where's my royalty check?
