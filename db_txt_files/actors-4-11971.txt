Kiera Knightly is one of the most promising young up and coming talents to have come out of Great Britain for a very long time. At times she can be absolutely hypnotic to watch because she commands such an incredible on screen presence and has so far proved in the few films she has starred in, that she can be amazingly versatile for her age, not just as an actress but also in looks. I don't think there is any question that she has a promising career ahead of her.
