Have had nothing but positive experiences with customer service, no problems with returns, extra help to get small sizes, etc. Unlike some stores (Victoria's Secret, for ex) where the catalog selections are far better than in-store, Nordstrom's store has better selection than their catalogues (at least in my experience). Prices reasonable.
