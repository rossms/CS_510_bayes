It's hard to top Silence of the Lambs, and this movie doesn't do it. I've found it useful to sit back and wait for the dust to settle before viewing some movies. Hannibal was like this. By the time I got round to seeing it, I knew it wasn't well rated and so I wasn't disappointed. In fact it was pretty good! I would rate Anthony Hopkins as one of the 10 best in his field and while Julianne Moore isn't Jodie Foster, she's a pretty reasonable Clarice Starling. My only problem was Ray Liotta, he just wasn't wasn't convincing (maybe he lost his head early in the piece).
