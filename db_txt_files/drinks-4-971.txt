Call me nuts. Everytime I go down to the USA (I'm in Canada eh) I HAVE to have a Rolling Rock! Even more surprising is I still enjoy it even after trying 200+ different world beers. Crazy thing is that it really isn't all that great of a beer! It is a good beer, not world class good beer but good beer if you want a beer to drink and enjoy. Pleasent to drink, light (body and taste) and refreshing, very little aftertaste. Again, call me crazy, but it isn't all that bad to drink on a hot day. :)
