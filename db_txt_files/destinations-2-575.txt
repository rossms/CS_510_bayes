The island is beautiful and the water is warm and great for snorkling/ diving/ sailing! On the other hand, a majority of the people TRASH the place, are rude and lazy. It seems a lot of people in Puerto Rico are making a living from US taxes and think that the navy is contaminating Vieques (hardly the truth). San Juan is nice for a day trip. See the castle and pick up a case of Bacardi Reserve, then get back to Florida for a vacation before your wallet gets stolen.
