Beautiful scenery and wonderful people. The poverty is bad, but what can be expected after so many years of government corruption. And those gypsies, try talking to them if you know Romanian. Some of them were very nice! Kind of funny that the people who appear to have been there rate it high and those who have not rate it low. Maybe people should stick to rating what they know.
