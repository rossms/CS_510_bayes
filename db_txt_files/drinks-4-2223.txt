A somewhat fruity, moderately sweetened green tea. In addition to somewhat offsetting the tea's bitterness, the cane sugar and fruit juice (lemon & passion fruit) give this drink its 60 calories (per 16 oz bottle). According to the label, its caffeine content is about 1/4th that of coffee. I find it a refreshing tea drink that, while being more accessible than pure green tea, still tastes enough like it not to disappoint most regular green tea drinkers.
