I was captivated by the beauty of Italy, but found myself hating the despicable Mr. Ripley within minutes of his flashing his toothy, trying-to-be-wholesome grin. Gwyneth Paltrow was totally believable as the wronged girlfriend and once again proved herself a brilliant, wonderful to look at, actress. Definitely worth seeing.
