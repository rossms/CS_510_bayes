Robin and I share the same birthday, but other then that, we are nothing alike. I guess thats what I admire about him. He's crazy and wild, not afraid to express anything. Nothing seems to bother him as far as public opinion goes and thats the way it should be. I love his movies and marvel at the different characters he can play. A true gift.
