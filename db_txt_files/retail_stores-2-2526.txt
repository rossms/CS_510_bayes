THis place is pretty awful. The store is disgusting. The fat and lazy rednecks of Lakeland leave the produce in the dog food aisle rather then walk two aisles down and return it. Parents physically abusing their children is an all too common sight. There is urine all over the floor and wall of the bathrooms. The store's only saving grace is $7.09 for a twelve pack of Pabst Blue Ribbon
