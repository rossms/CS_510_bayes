I love our Commander-in-Chief. He is so diammetrically opposed to Clinton, it makes me so proud to be a Republican. Our President has done so much for our great nation since he took office. He has waged an all out war against terrorism, offered an economic stimulus package, advocated educational reforms and incentives, and routed out scumbag CEOs from unscrupulous companies. President Bush does more before breakfast than Clinton was capable of doing in months.
