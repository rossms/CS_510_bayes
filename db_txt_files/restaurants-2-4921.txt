Very overpriced and the food is almost always dry and stale. The burgers are extremely overhyped in advertising and it really shows when you actually buy one of the pathetic things. The only good thing going for the place are the milkshakes..they are the real deal and actually taste really good. An extra star for the shakes, but other than that a big bummer...
