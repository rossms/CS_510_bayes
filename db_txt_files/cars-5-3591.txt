We bought our first one in 1990 and traded it only because we moved to a very hot dry area where the sun shines most of the time. That Explorer was black--too hot here. Changed to frosty mocha in 1994 and it is wonderful. We have had no problems with it at all and have 75,000+ miles on it. We would have bought another, but they have limited the knee and leg space under the steering wheel and my husband no longer fits. So we had to go to another SUV (didn't want anything bigger in the Ford or any other line.)
