I enjoyed this album. Slick Rick still has some lyrics after getting out of jail for shooting his brother. This album had a nice lineup of featured artists, from both east and west coast. Slick Rick's voice brings across an attitude that tells listeners he's putting it down. Though Slick Rick is still rapping, I found sometimes his lyrics lacking in content.
