The book was great. The movie was definitely not. I fell asleep through it the first time around. I gave it another try and was underwhelmed. One of the cheesiest lines I ever heard in cinema was when Sting yelled in the middle of his climactic fight to the death with Paul Maud'dib, I will kill him!!! It is lampooned quite often in Mystery Science Theater 3000. Thank stars they elected not to do Dune sequels.
