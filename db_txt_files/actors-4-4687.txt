I adored David Boreanaz when he portrayed Angelus on season 2 of Buffy the Vampire Slayer. This characterization was dead on. I like the character Angel, but prefer David as Angelus. I love the Angel TV show. This is the only show I have to watch. I think David has room for improvement, and I look forward to seeing him in completely different roles in the future.
