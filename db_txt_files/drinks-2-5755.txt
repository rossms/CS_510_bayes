I tried it when it first hit the market. What's the rave?! To be quite honest, I just don't know what people are excited about. Maybe I'm not with it, but it seems to me that the sweeter it is, the more people like it. These days, much of the syrupy soft drinks are nearly sickening to me. I prefer tea.
