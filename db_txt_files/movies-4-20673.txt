Although the movie is very long (about 4 hours) and it is a bit boring, the story line is actually quite good. When I first watched it, I hated it and fell asleep. But after understanding the WW2 background, it makes more sense. The music is very positive and well thought out. It is good clean entertainment with nothing dirty or offensive.
