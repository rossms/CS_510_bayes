I've been very pleased with my rentals from Budget. They have very competitive prices and their online reservation system is a snap. A couple of months ago I tried the special they've been having on Ford Ranger pickup trucks for only $20 a day and that's exactly what it cost me $20 a day, (if you don't get their insurance) no extra charges, and the truck was great, it gave me no trouble and I must've driven it least 4,000 miles.
