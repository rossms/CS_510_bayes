Adelman will coach the Kings to the 2nd round of the playoffs this year, partly because the team chemistry should improve after the necessary Webber trade--a trade that helped BOTH the Kings and the 76ers. Not even Adelman and Petrie will have solved the challenges posed by the elite in the Western Conference this year. But with a healthy Peja, 2005-6 should be great for the Kings! Rest up, Peja, and do not let the media and fans pressure you to return before the injuries fully heal! Go Kings! Sacramento loves you!
