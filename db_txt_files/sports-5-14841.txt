Your running back is for rushing the ball, not your quarterback. And considering Favre rarely gets sacked, I don't see why leaving the pocket is that big of a deal. He is one of the best, if not THE best, quarterbacks of all time. He is extremely talented and elevates the play of the athletes around him.
