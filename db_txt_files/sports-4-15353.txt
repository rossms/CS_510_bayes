Hasn't really proven himself yet. Great talent, we'll have to wait to see if he becomes a great player. UPDATE: Why does every woman come on here saying he's hot? He looks goofy as hell to me, with his buckteeth and boob-shaped head. Still, he's managed to have another 10+ sack season, but I don't think that's all that impressive when you consider how good everyone on the Panthers line is. He should honestly be getting more sacks than that. Plus, I don't think he's been the best in run support, although he has been improving.
