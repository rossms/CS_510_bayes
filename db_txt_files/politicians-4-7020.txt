I believe he's a good hearted man. No one would be complaining as much if he was a white man. He has done a great service to this country and we should be grateful. In less you are willing to put your life in the spotlight and take on his agenda, who are you to criticize? Instead of complaining, do something about it and make a difference yourself.
