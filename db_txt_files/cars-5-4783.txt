Just bought a 2004 edge 4x2 3.0l LOVE IT! added K&n air filter-Tornado and Denso plugs.. Runs so much better now than with factory equipment Ford Rangers have always been a great running truck for me as the last one i put 240,000 on it and was running still great when sold My first choice will always be FORD RANGER! A+!
