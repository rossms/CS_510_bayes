The first problem with this movie is that I didn't remember a single thing about it 5 minutes after I walked out of the theater. The second problem was that I was waiting for Jon Bon Jovi to orchestrate a South Pacific type number on the submarine and it never happened. The third problem is that I paid $7.50 to see this piece of crap. Save your money and rent a real submarine movie... Das Boot.
