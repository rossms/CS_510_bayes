If I had to come up with similar players, I think Greg Luzinski or Frank Howard. But Ortiz did get Boston a ring. That in itself, is a Hall of Fame achievement. Though Sabermetricians say there is no empirical evidence that certain hitters thrive in clutch situations, Ortiz is living proof that sometimes stats are meaningless. Ortiz timely hitting wins games. By virtue of this and his gaudy batting numbers, I think he should win the AL MVP this year.
