We have a 1998 Ford Windstar. Besides the fact that its a 3.0 liter and doesn't have a lot of get up and go, it has been good to us. We live in Sicily, Italy and have driven it all the way to Germany twice and to Pisa and that is a long way. We have over 100,000 miles on it and I think that is when stuff starts to happen. We just got a new battery and now our starter has gone. Bottom line, we have been happy with our Ford Windstar.
