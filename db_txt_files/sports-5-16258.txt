I have been a buffalo bills fan for years. Doug has been getting a raw deal from the begining! Although I will remain a Bills fan I can't help but watch the chargers this season. I hope they go all the way to the top, and Flutie will have my 100% support!! If for some reason the chargers win a super bowl w/ Flutie I hope he tells the NFL and the bills to kiss his a@S !!
