One of the great power hitters of the BS (Before Steroids) era. One of the best players of the '70s -- leading the Buccos to 6 post-seasons and 2 World Championships. Two Home run crowns and an MVP in 1979. He won the MVP solely on his stellar leadership of the Pirates to an improbable World title. I believe Stargell hit one of the longest homers in Philly Vet stadium history, travelling so far that it would have bonked one of them drunken Eagles fans that reside in the 700 level square on the noggin' (X-Rays show nothing). We'll miss you Pops.
