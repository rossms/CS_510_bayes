If ever there has lived a man with the weight of the world and all the odds against him ... If ever there was one man who by sheer will and determination kept a nation together ... If ever there is a less appreciated man for obeying and making the Constitution of the US a living and breathing document - then that man was Abraham Lincoln ... I have read volumes of books and biographies about President Lincoln, and at the end of the day in comparison to todays president (W) to your 16th president my conclusion: Lincoln makes me truly wish I were an American, George W makes me thank God each day that I am not!
