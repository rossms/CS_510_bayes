This book helps you realize how important it is to communicate with your family - especially when it is a difficult subject. It is the story of a family who completely falls apart when a daughter is raped. The father can't deal with it sends her away the mother just prentends that nothing happened. Before the rape they were the considered to be the perfect family , and now they are outcasts in their own community. I didn't think the ending was the best but it was still a good read. I am left wishing life could have turned out better for this poor family.
