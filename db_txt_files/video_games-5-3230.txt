I only have a Play Station 1 so I am a bit out of my league here. This is more in honor of the original classic Spy Hunter game. I always liked the unpredictability of Spy Hunter. Is the car coming up behind me a friend or an enemy? Will the bridge be out when I get to it? Will there be ice on the next set of roads? You never really know.
