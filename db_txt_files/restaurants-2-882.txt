it is overpriced. so-so quality. the low carb wraps are almost 5 bucks for a dinky wrap. portion control is fine, but charge accordingly!! and as far as healthy... it isn't all that much healthier than other fast food joints. Wendy's offers a 99 cent value menu with better choices. you can find salads at any fast food place... cheaper & better quality, not shredded lettuce! real lettuce pieces, real spinach. in my humble opinion... i would pass it by.
