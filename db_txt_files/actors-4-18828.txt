Maybe it's the Titanic backlash getting the better of me, but I felt myself itching to give Cameron just two or three stars. Then, after a deep breath, I calmly reminded myself that I enjoyed True Lies, both Terminator movies, The Abyss, and Aliens. Not exactly a list of intellectually stimulating masterpieces, but quite a few good movies nonetheless. Cameron may specialize in harmless, crowd-pleasing, popcorn movies, but what he does he does well.
