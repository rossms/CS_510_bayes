Conyers is a Congressman from Michigan, he was the one of the founders of the Congressional Black Caucus. I think he puts too much focus on racial matters and past injustices. Some things are better left in the past, the civil rights movement has to move on to the 21st Century if it expects to make a positive contribution to American society. On another note, Conyers earned a distinctive place in American history by being one of the first 20 members of Richard Nixon's enemies list. As a young congressman from Detroit, he spoke frequently against the Nixon Administration's policies.
