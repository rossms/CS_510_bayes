Jesse Jackson's sanctimonious victimspeak holds down those he purports to help by encouraging them to think that all their troubles are someone else's fault and that they are helpless to reverse their situation except through government aid. Millions of blacks have proven him wrong and have lifted themselves up in the American way, through hard and persistent work. Millions are now middle class and many of them conservative, realizing that govt force should be a last resort. I pray that the Black Conservative movement will undo the grave damage that Mr Jackson has done to our nation.
