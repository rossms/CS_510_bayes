I'm a huge closet Tim Burton fan. His prowess for visual creativity is without match. The sets, the costumes, the cinematography, the casting...everything about a tim Burton film is designed to a tee. His touch is unmistakable. Creative, lighthearted, Tim Burton's films are joyful and compelling to watch. The only downside is sometimes the writing can't equal the visual, leaving the films occasionally empty.
