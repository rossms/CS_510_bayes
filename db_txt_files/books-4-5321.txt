Blood Meridian is like a very cruel, cold and sadistic One Hundred Years Of Solitude(Gabriel Garcia Marquez). It is unusually violent, but that's what the story calls for. The brutality does not seem out of place in this setting. I took one star away because the last third of the book seems to wander aimlessly and in no way enhance the story.
