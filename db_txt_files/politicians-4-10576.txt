Gee, what a dumb dummy. He's such a dummy. And so go all of the arguements I have heard against our president. It won't matter what I say in favor of George W. Bush, his critics will ignore it and continue to believe what they do. It won't matter it I tell you he received a bachelor's degree from Yale University and a Master of Business Administration from Harvard Business School. The bottom line is if you are Pro-Bush you probably know all the facts and are not just following the pied piper like many others and if you are anti-Bush chances are you are just plugging your ears and humming along.
