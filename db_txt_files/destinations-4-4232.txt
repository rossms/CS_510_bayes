I don't see anything wrong with Jacksonville, other than its relative obscurity compared to Orlando, Tampa and Miami. They have some nice beaches, and the nightlife on the beaches is great. (Sneakers is an excellent sports bar.) Also, the radio stations are very good. On the downside, drive north or west out of the city, and the metro area just suddenly dies. But that's a minor quibble. Overall, I had fun in Jacksonville, and I'd have no problem with visiting again.
