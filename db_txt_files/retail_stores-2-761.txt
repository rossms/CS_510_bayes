I am pretty turned off by Old Navy..even with their new line of what they are calling higher fashion..they offer what's in style (I guess..I do not wear pants with the crotch down to my knees so I guess I am not too hip) but the quality is so poor it is not worth it. If you buy something from Old Navy, plan on only having it for that season..because by next season it will be out of style (that is, if it is still intact).
