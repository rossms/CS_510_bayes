Your right marpike, any player who is so good they need to change the rules is truly one of the baseball gods. True, during the time of his peak, pitching was dominating the game but he punctuated the need for the rule change. I never saw him play but I understand, like Ryan, he learned to harness his power and develop into a true pitcher, using guile as well as power to defeat batters. Also, my dad says he could field well and hit a ton, for anyone not just a pitcher, so good that he would have been amongst the best in the majors at any position.
