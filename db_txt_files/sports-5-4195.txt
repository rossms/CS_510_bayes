He is a great coach--getting more out of lesser talent then any other coach of the past decade. BTW, Turtleboy: Under Majerus the Utes have lost only one first round game of the NCAA tourney. He has won eight or more. The Utes have been to the sweet 16 four or five times, the elite 8 twice and the final four once--losing in the Championship game in 1998. How much further does a team have to go to qualify in your book?
