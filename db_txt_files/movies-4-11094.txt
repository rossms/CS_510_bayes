This is a challenging movie to rate. I agree with some of the reviews that say the movie had no focus, no plot, etc. On the other hand, I cannot remember laughing as hard as I did during certain scenes in this movie. Those three sons of Carrey's; their dialogs and exchanges were a riot! Talk about great ideas; take three black young men, make 'em talk like they're from the inner city but make them geniuses and what a combination! I fast forward this movie to scenes the brothers are in...pretty funny stuff.
