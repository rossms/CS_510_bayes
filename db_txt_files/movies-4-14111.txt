Truman Show is a good movie about a man named Truman whose whole life has been a lie and made into a tv show ever since he was bron. But as time goes on he starts to realize things are not as they seem. Finally he gets the chance to decide if he wants to leave or stay. Clever movie Jim Carrey did a good job as Truman.
