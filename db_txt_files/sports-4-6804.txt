Ok lets get one thing straight, Doc Rivers had to take the celtics out of a lot of trouble that Patino put them in. This season with the amount of rookies and talent on that team, he has made it into a decent competing team. so those who say that doc rivers suck can kiss my a$$. he is going to turn this team into a power house and he deserves mad props -----The 16 year old
