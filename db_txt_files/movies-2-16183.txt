Even with the presence of a great ensemble and excellent director, the film is a complete mess. Scorcese's direction is weak and the film has so many holes in it that it's not even funny. DiCaprio and Diaz give great performances, but Day-Lewis is given some of the worst villian material that I've EVER seen. The scenic design was the only real merit to it.
