I can't believe where Shaq is on this list! His rating shows how little credibility this list has! I am not a Laker fan by far. Neither am I a big fan of Shaq, but my opinions are honest. Bottom line: SHAQ IS THE MOST DOMINANT PLAYER IN THE NBA! PERIOD! There is no bigger threat in the low-post from five feet in than Shaq. Whether you like him or not, he is the horse that the Lakers have ridden to three championships. Sure, Kobe is more than nice to have around, but the NBA is still a leage dominated by low-post play, and Shaq is the man. Without a doubt, he is currently the 2nd best player in the league.
