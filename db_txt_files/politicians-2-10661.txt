I really wanted to give Nixon 2.5 stars, but that's not an option, and I just couldn't go 3. I can't believe Nixon ranks below GW Bush in these ratings. Nixon and his administration were corrupt, but they were child's play compared to the current Bush administration. If history has been this unkind to Nixon, GW Bush has nothing to look forward to, unless he is a glutton for punishment. GW Bush will ultimately improve Nixon's reputation and standing in history.
