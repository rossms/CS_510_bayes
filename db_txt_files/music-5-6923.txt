Like it or not, this is a monument in the world of jazz music. It is a religious piece but it contains, in abundance, the key ingredients of fine jazz: rhythmic propulsion, improvisation, and, crucially, tonnes of soul. The combo is Coltrane's classic quartet of the early/mid 60's, displaying awesome individual performances, but tightly bound. Let this music enter your life!
