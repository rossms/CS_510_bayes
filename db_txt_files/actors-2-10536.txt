drew- you used to star in movies that were interesting and intelligent [poison ivy, trashy but intriguing; firestarter; irreconcilable differences] and now every movie that you act in is STUPID, mindless, annoying slapstick comedy! have you lost all respect for yourself as an actor? please! 'never been kissed'? '50 first dates'? 'the wedding singer'??? TRY making a movie WITHOUT adam sandler, PLEASE!
