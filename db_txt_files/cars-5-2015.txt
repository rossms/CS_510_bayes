my rating is actually between 4 and 5 because if you get an older one it will cost you a small fortune to maintain it, but it will be a blast to drive. i have two right now, an 89 and a 71 which i just purchased. both are convertibles and one of the negative aspects of them is there is no extra space. this is not a problem with the coupes though, and from what i have heard the newer ones actually have a trunk.
