X-men. It makes me jelous i wasn't born with special powers. I love the x-men series they are always intertaining. I enjoy watching the fighting in this movie and i think that there is more to enjoy that the first one lacks. Obviously id have to say the original was better but i still think that this was a brilliant movie. Fun to watch and i wasn't boared a moment. I'll definatly have the DVD when it comes out in stores. If you are a Comic book fan this is a must see. And even if your not it is still an enjoyable movie. I HOPE GAMBIT IS IN THE NEXT ONE!!!
