Coach Weis had a very impressive first year at Notre Dame. While Notre Dame has had some good years since Lou Holtz left, this was the best looking offense that has been seen since then. With all of the hype around him and the program right now, I think he will do a great job recruiting, and will have a lot of success in the future.
