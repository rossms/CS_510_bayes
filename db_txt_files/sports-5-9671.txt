The best team in basketball, and in my opinion, the odds on favorite to win the 2003 crown. They have nine players that could start for virtually any team in the league, and have a surprisingly good defense to go with their offense. The Arco Arena is the best home court advantage in the league, and the influence of the immortal Pete Carril can be seen in their back door cuts. How can this team lose?
