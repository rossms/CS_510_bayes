I wasn't thrilled with the idea of a ford escort wagon. I really wanted a Saturn! But this has turned out to be a great little car. A bit sluggish on hills, but very reliable, a good amount of space for stuff inthe back and excellent gas mileage. I have had no trouble with my used escort in over a year. Much cheaper than the alternatives too!
