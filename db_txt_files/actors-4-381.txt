Mitchum was always a far better actor than people gave him credit for. His role in Night of the Hunter was one of his best and DeNiro couldn't touch him in Cape Fear. Another favorite of mine was Friends of Eddie Coyle. I think his very real talent was often overshadowed by his drinking and real-life antics.
