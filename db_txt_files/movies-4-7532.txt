The movie has held up fairly well over time. A great cast that stretches over generations, from the young Eddie Murphy to the Don Ameche. Also one of those movies that is fun to watch for the bit parts and cameos, with Al Franken, Tom Davis, and Jim Belushi all jumping in along the way. A great look at the World Trade Center long before it's destruction near the end of the movie as well.
