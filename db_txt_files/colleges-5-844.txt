Great school and great teachers! I am in my fifth flexnet class and it is very challenging. I think that if you are not a self-motivated person then this is not the school for you. Stick to going to community college. UOP has tons of resources to help you and guide you and they require you to take your general ED just like other colleges. Also they require you to pass an assessment of English, Math and Critical Thinking just like other colleges, so they are legit and challenging.
