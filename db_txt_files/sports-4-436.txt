Without question, Manny is an incredible offensive player. His numbers have been absolutely staggering. His defense, however, is another story. Manny tends to let his mind wander when he is in the field, leading to poor fielding plays and decisions. And, he is one quirky dude. Here's a guy who was ready to hold up his signing with the Red Sox because he wanted them to hire a clubhouse attendant who was a good friend. I think that Manny will ultimately regret his decision to sign with the Red Sox. Beloved by the fans, he had the perfect situation in Cleveland.
