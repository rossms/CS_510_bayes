She cracks me up. I think Drew's appeal is also her personal free spirit, and that seems to shine through in her acting. She was great in Ever After as Cinderella, and hilarious and sweet in Home Fries. Of course, she was everyone's sweetheart in E.T. Her legendary family enhances her star status but she is clearly her own woman and a very independent spirit.
