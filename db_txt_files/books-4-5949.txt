Not a bad book...although I prefer some of Demille's other work. He has an infectious sotrytelling flow that makes each of his books hard to put down. Although I see a common trend of older man falling in love with a younger woman type senario in ech of his books? Besides that Demille is a good author and I have enjoyed his books so far.
