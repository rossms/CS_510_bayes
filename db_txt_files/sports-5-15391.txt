I hate to do this because I hate the Colts, but Peyton may very well be the best QB in the League. He's a field general. He can take control of a game with constant audibles and precision passing. Most QBs on pass heavy teams look like they only look good because of their recievers' talent (Mark Bulger or Kerry Collins for instance). However, I get the opposite effect from Peyton Manning. It seems like he makes his recievers look good. Too bad I hate the Colts.
