The KING .... 5 stars! By far the best all around smoke, and ive smoked just about everything. Its almost worth the risk of cancer just to smoke these great tasting full bodied smokes. Do yourself a favor, chuck whatever else your smoking and pick up a pack of reds. Its worth every cent. PS. I agree with someone who stated earlier in another post that RJR didnt know how to make decent cigarettes. They are seriously gross tasting. ESP camels, i dont like the turkish aftertaste they seem to leave ... winstons are ALRIGHT i guess but will NEVER be marlboro as much as RJR wants them to be
