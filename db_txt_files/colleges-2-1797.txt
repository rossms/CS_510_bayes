This is a very overated LITTLE IVY wantabe.The campus has no diversity for the administration is fearful that by doing so it would lower its precious SAT median.Wealth and high SATS are what get you in to this freezing cold and sterile environment. All foreign students are millionaires or close to it.The students are snobby and elitist.Having lived in Vermont I can tell you the climate is miserable.
