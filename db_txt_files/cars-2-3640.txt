Not good for a midsize SUV. Its a 7 passenger, but the 3rd row seat is for children only. It has the pricing of a full size SUV. Its great off road, but Land Rover's haven't been great on realiablity and its redesign for 2003 is more of a face lift. Plenty of power, but roll overs have been constant in these.
