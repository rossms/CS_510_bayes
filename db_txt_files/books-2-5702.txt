Very disappointing. That dead bastard! Just kidding. It was pretty bad though. I couldn't wait for it to end, and when it did, I immediately forgot everything about it. I love Puzo though - don't get me wrong. But he should've moved on to a different subject matter after 'The Godfather'. It's like when the Great One, MJ, played for the Wizards. He was fine compared to most, but horribly disappointing considering what we were all used to seeing from him. Slight contradiction, but 'The Sicilian' remains in my top 10-but you know what I mean.
