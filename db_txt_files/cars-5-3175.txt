Unlike Bob2, I actually own a 4Runner and love it. This SUV has only one minor flaw, the front seats are slightly uncomfortable. It runs great, gets good gas milage for its class, and has awesome looks. It is a real winner and if you are lucky enough to be able to afford one, unlike poor bob2, buy it!
