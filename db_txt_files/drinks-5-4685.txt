King of soft drinks. Diet tastes almost as good as Classic. Needs to put caffeine free coke in the 20oz. and 1 liter sizes though. Classic is much better tasting than that inferior teeny bopper Pepsi product. If I were to ban one company from advertising it would certainly be Pepsi. People actually want to drink that stuff after the commercials?!?!?
