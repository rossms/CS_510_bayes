I generally liked the movie, but it overemphasized the CG. Nice eye candy, and it was good, but I believe that CG should support the story, not overshadow it. The themes were pretty neat (been done, but neat). I'm glad Keanu Reeves didn't talk too much--he just didn't fit in, he just seemed kind of like he was ripped straight from Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure and forgot to drop the character!
