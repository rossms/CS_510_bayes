Chicago is a good city (like Philly) to stuff yourself with foods that will kill you by the time you are 40. And...they are all GOOD! Abandon your diet for a week while you are there....you wont regret it. Plenty of Polish and German places too...on top of all the pizza, dogs, and Gibson steaks. I'm from the NY area...and I think NYC is in danger of losing its edge..too pricey. The artists are leaving NY. Chicago has kept its grit even though its a modern city. Seems like a great place to raise kids too.
