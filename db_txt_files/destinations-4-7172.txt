Very dirty, smelly and run down. On the other hand one of the most exotic and romantic locations in the world - gondolas, canals: fantastic. Overall, no older or more steeped in history than many other places, and it smells awful, and is very touristy, yet an amazing place. Utterly unique. But the smell!
