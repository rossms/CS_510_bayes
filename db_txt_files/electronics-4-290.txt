JVC portable CD players provide clear, crisp sounds through headphones or speakers. They are also shock-resistant to the level of keeping the track time and returning to that point in a song in the event of jostling. I've gotten good use of my JVC portable CD player, especially considering it's clearly marked buttons and lightweight.
