Paul Pierce is yet another great one in Celtics legacy and lore. I agree with Tommy Heinsohn, he reminds me a bit of John Havlicek. Paul is excellent to watch and is the poor man's Kobe Bryant. Hail to the Boston Celtics. Hail to Paul Pierce and Ricky Davis. You wear that uniform proudly. Thank you.
