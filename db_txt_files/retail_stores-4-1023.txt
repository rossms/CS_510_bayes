pretty good! i always wear the clothes! they are not THAT overpriced, too! just find a good sale! the clothes aren't EXACTLY my type, but EVERYONE in my school wears them! i love the logos and stuff on the tees. note: i must admit, tee shirts and maybe long sleevs shirts, are the only reasonably priced stuff.
