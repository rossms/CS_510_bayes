This is a very well done colorful,imaginative and all together feel good video for a feel good song. You walk away from this video with a grin on your face humming the tune and go on your merry way. Not overly flashy,nothing is getting shoved down your throught like a B.Spears video. It is a cute happy three or four minutes of your life. You go Nelly.Keep up the good work!
