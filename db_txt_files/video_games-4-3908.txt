I've only played this probably a half dozen times so I can't give a whole lot of insight other than the fact that Laura is a babe ( and yes I know it's just a animated character thanks) and that this is the gift I give my brother in law every year for Christmas. Every year a new version comes out and every year I buy it for him. Easy peasy japanesey ( -what movie?) He loves the whole series.
