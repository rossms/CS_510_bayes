Been there many times and it certainly is big and serves all but the discount flights. Fine attractive atmosphere and archetecture, but I would like terminal M (international) to be much closer so it will be easier to go from domestic arrivals to international departures. However it's easily accesible to CTA Train, and I'm pleased as it is a hub for the airlines I trust.
