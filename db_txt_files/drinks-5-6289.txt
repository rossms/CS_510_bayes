This is the BEST diet soda I have found. Aspartame is what makes you crave carbs. Diet Rite is made with Splenda, which is real sugar. I am on the Atkins Diet and avoid most diet products because they contain aspartame, which is why I was so excited to see a diet drink that used Splenda. It has a MUCH better taste than any diet drink I've tried. I love it! Try it - you'll like it :-)
