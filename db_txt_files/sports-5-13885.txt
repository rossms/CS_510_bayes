Walter Payton my pick for the Greatest Athlete of All Time. Nobody did it better. Screw Jim Brown. Walter ran behind inferior O-lines. Some of his best runs were called back because of stupid Noah Jackson's penalties. The ONLY REASON Brown did well at all was because of his CHAMPIONSHIP OFFENSIVE LINE. Not because he had any talent. But this is about Walter and this site says it all.
