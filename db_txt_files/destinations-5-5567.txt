I've traveled through and visited in Virginia many times, and each time love it more. The Blue Ridge mountains and skyline drive along the Blue Ridge Parkway are incredibly beautiful; and most people I have met subscribe to a more genteel way of life without sacrificing their backbone. Virginia gets slammed for being "too right winged." Well...for our open minded liberals who embrace the right to be different without ridicule, shouldn't you celebrate the "right winger's" right to be different from you?
