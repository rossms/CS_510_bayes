This is not the best movie ever to come out, but Jamie Lee Curtis was so funny in this that I laughed to whole time. Tom Arnold and Arnie were like old buddies that looked out for eachother since they were little. I really loved this movie not because it had meaning, just because it was funny and it the plot was excellent! Whoever thought that screenplay up, was really using thier head.
