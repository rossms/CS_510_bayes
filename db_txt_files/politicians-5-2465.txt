I rated him very high in spite of the fact that I am not crazy about his politics. BUT he was magnificent during the 9/11 horror and I do mean during as he stayed right there, showed remarkable leadership qualities and was brave. I believe he comforted and inspired many New Yorkers by his behavior. He urged New Yorkers to cry, cry and cry and confessed that he had cried every nite during the crisis and I greatly admired that non-macho message.
