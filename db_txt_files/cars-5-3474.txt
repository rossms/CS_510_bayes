I just got a 2003 last week. What an exceptional car!! How many SUVs out there let you roll up your windows when you forgot to, even with the keys in your hand! The price was very affordable and you're definitely getting more bang for the buck with it. They don't look that big on the outside but excellent leg room in the front and plenty of room in the back. It rides very well. I hope this one lasts.
