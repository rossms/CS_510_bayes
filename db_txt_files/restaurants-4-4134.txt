I actually dined here at teh Baton Rouge Smokey last nite. I was really impressed with the Pulled Pork platter and the awesome cornbread starter. The Spiked Strawberry Lemonade was good, too. The atmosphere was nice although the 8 tv's were a bit distracting. If you are not into BBQ, there are a lot of other things on the menu to choose from. Give them a try.
