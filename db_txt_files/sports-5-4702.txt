I realize that Stan Heath had a tough first year at Arkansas, but he is obviously a good coach. If someone can lead Kent State to the elite 8, than you are dealing with a coach that knows what he is doing. Coach Heath's first year as a Razorback was tough because he was stuck with a bunch of raw talented freshmen, that needed some real leadership. In the next few years to come Coach Heath and the Razorback's will be back to the NCAA tourney, and will make a statement.
