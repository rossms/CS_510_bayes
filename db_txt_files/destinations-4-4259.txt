Big, clean, with lots to do. Great restaurants and shopping. Has it all. Diverse population, the arts, culture, sports, in the city housing is pretty cheap too. One big surprise to me was the huge bodies of water in the area. Huge lakes with lots of boating and fishing. Beautiful homes all around Dallas. Pretty cool place to me.
