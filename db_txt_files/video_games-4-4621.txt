The Command a Conquer series is really quite good and Tiberian Son is no exception. You different kind of soldiers you can use and plenty of vehicles and buildings. You have two sides that you can play, the good and the bad guys and each side has slight differences in equipment and personel. The game is broken into missions and some are better than others. You can capture buildings be sending in engineers. The is not to difficult and has different setting but it will keep you enthralled for quite some time. Definitly a good buy.
