Perhaps the second best of this band's albums, Morrison's swan song. Five very strong songs on the record. Well played, produced, and punchy for a band without a bass player (which I always thought was a major deficiency of this band). The title track is superb. Too bad Jim wasted himself shortly after this album was released. There was just too much high powered pharmaceutical speed that he could buy over-the-counter in Paris. And all that Napolean brandy, too...
