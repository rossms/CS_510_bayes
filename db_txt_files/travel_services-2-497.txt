Frankfurt... Totally confusing mess. I flew through in Jan 2003, not a single flight departures board to find my connecting flight. I followed the signs to the transit train and came to a blocked wall. Tried going back the way I had come and the doors were closed. I finally had to go the OPPOSITE way to the signs and at the far end of the terminal, completely the opposite way to the signs, I found the transit link. The other hald of the terminal was dark, black plastic floors and low ceilings. Not warm, friendly or welcoming. The shopping is limited, very poor. Only good think is the network!
