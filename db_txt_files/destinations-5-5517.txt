I love Oregon! It's got everything the ocean, the mountains, dunes, a mild climate. Winters aren't to harsh and neither are the summers. Unfortunatly good paying jobs are scarce from so many people relocating to Oregon. I'm not sure what's up with the ban on pumping your own gas but hey it creates more jobs so pay a few cents more. As for the deposit on cans, I wish all states had that, anything to help keep the trash off the roads. I've been to Oregon at least 5 times and love it more each time.
