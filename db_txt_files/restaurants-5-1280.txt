When not in the mood for a burger or chicken, Arby's is my personal favorite. While a little on the pricey side, their mainstay roast beef sandwiches are filling, tasty (with sauces), and relatively healthy. If one is lucky, there will be a regular special where Arby's is selling 5 sandwiches for '$5.00. Their chicken fingers are good as well. Arby's also offers a choice of homestyle or curly fries.
