I know it's an easy cheap shot, but I'm sorry- I cannot get past this woman's physical appearance. Sure, she's a talented actress but she is a horrible role model in terms of image. It's people like her who have inspired 8-year-old girls to go on diets. I can't stand to look at her, with her skeleton-with-skin figure, sunken face and scrawny-ass neck. She needs to admit she is anorexic or bulimic then needs to be strapped to a board and force-fed McDonald's cheeseburgers, doughnuts and Twinkies for about two weeks. The sight of her bony ass sickens me to no end and overshadows any acting she does.
