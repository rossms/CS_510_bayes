Rock 'n' roll heaven. I love England. The people there are so polite and friendly...they have this way of making tourists feel right at home. Lyric of the Day: She held the child and whispered with calm, calm, Belong! . And okay, I'll admit it, my favorite rock group(s) came out of England. And the scenery is so beautiful! There is not a place in England that is not bursting with lush green grass, trees, ivy, and flowers. I went to Dartford when I was ten, and I hope to go back sometime soon. Take care, everyone!
