Gummy Bears are pretty much only designed to catch the attention of small children. I've seen adults eat them, but they were never made to make an adult feel better, like a nice package of M M's do. They are hard to chew and they get stuck in your teeth, luckily for the children it doesn't matter who sees their funky colored teeth, or take notice of the hard time they are having just to get them down.
