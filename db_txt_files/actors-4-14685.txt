Lol, lot's of hate for Jennifer. I can see why, considering some of her behavior, and yet, in the right role, she can be appealing. I though she was very good in Selena. Her style of music is not something I really listen to, and I don't claim to have a great ear for musical talent, but I don't think she's that bad. Somebody must like her because she's selling her records, and making money. And she is a exotic beauty, with some considerable assets.
