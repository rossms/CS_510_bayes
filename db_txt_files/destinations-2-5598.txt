Stationed here in Virginia Beach for the last four years. My impression is overcrowded, over priced, over-taxed and unfriendly. Terrible beaches. Consistent bad weather. Between Norfolk and DC is the WORST traffic and drivers in the state. Virginia's saving grace is the western mountain-y side with good people and nice countryside.
