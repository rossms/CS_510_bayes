It's not the greatest place on earth, but it is my home country and I love Taiwan from the depth of my heart. Yes, there's poverty, there is beautiful natural resource, there are prosperous modern cities... all here, in Taiwan. Visit Taipei or Kaohsiung if you want night life. Visit the seven national parks throughout Taiwan to understand why the island gets the name formosa (Island of beauty) One thing is for sure though, that is, there's good food wherever you go in Taiwan!!
