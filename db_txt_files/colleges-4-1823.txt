Great school, but good luck with all campus services such as financial aid, advisors, registration, bursar's office, etc.... They will nickel and dime you to death and give you the total runaround. Everyone tries to put their job onto everyone else. If you think your going to go to one office for a short period of time, get ready--you will spend 3 days running back and forth across campus to the different offices! The school/social atmosphere is great! And Lafayette/West Lafayette are awesome places to live!
