The greatest team ever. So what out of 13 tries they won 1 world series that doesnt make them bad just unlucky they have the greatet farm team of all time and the greatest pitching coach of all time if you notice Mazzone makes stars out of average pitchers because when they leave Atlanta they suck (except for Maddux he will always be a Brave at heart). Andruw Jones has the greatest glove of all time. THEY ARE AMERICAS TEAM!!! (not you you f****** Yankees and thats because yall suck)
