The idea to combine a PDA and cell phone is worth 4 stars on its own. I will be very interested to see if Samsung lives up to its reputation with this combo. It almost seems too good to be true, especially the ability to use the computer part of it while on the telephone. This will surely revolutionalize wireless technology..less devices to carry around, the ease of having all info and capabilities in one handheld..pretty amazing. Should be an interesting device, although I imagine the price will be pretty astronomical at first.
