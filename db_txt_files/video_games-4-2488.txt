I enjoy this as a single and multiplayer type game. The controls are easy enough so that anyone can play. The courses are challenging and the music is great. You will not get bored easily as there are various modes of play available. I enjoy the mini-golf challenge. On a side note, when you are waiting for your turn, you can press different buttons to get your character to make various kinds of comments in the background - Some are quite humerous.
