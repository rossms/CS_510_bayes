this is a good team and a very fun one to watch...they play more like a TEAM than a group of individuals, which is always really cool to see in the NBA. Being a duke fan, i may glorify them more than they deserve, but Duhon and Deng have brought a lot to the table and they are going to be very successful as Bulls. (at least once Deng recovers)
