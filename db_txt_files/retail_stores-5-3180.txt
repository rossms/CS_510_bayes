I have been a Netflix customer for 2 years, and have been very satisfied with it. The recurring flat fee is reasonable ($20/month), and I get 9-12 rentals per month with 2-4 day turnaround in this area (Nashville, TN). Most of the complaints I have seen seem to be from the NY warehouse, so maybe that's the problem. I haven't had any of the problems with damaged discs or lost DVDs. In any case, I am terrible at getting DVDs back to the video store, and one night of rentals can quickly become a $50 affair, or I end up returning movies I haven't yet seen. So, this has been a great service for me.
