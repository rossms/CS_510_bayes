I don't think I saw the Steve McQueen version, I must have sen a remake made sometime in the 1970's. Anyway, As a child, this movie scarred the hell out of me. I couldn't even talk about it without getting frightened all over again. I didn't even watch again for several years. But then when I finally got the courage to see it again, I couldn't believe it was the same movie, as absolutly nothing frightened me. I thought it was funny. Looking back on it, I can laugh at how it made me feel the first time I saw it. I think that is what makes a good horror movie.
