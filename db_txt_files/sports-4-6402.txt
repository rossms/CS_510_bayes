I was seriously torn between a 3 and a 4 on this one. I decided to give them a 4 on the sheer fact that they sweapt Duke this year, and beat them in last year's tourny. They have A LOT of talent, and I will personally be watching their progress for next year. Caner-Medley will be a senior, and will take much of the leadership on his shoulders. Gilchrist will also make an impact, making Maryland my team to watch next year in the ACC. We already know that the ACC holds great schools such as UNC, Duke, and WF; but I think next year Maryland will come into their own. They just need to be consistent.
