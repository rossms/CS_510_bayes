This CD is pretty bad actually. I'm thinking that he released it not so much for the musical content for people to get into but to sort of make known what his religious beliefs are. There were many references to that. It should have been stored in the vault though lol. There was one cut on it that I liked, Mellow, which was pretty nice. Other than that I was bored. What was up with that weird, deep computer voice that he used throughout the album? It was a strange piece of work but did have some nice jazzy grooves at times.
