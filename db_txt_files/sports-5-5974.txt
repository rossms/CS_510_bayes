Redick is by far the best shooter in the nation. But hes not only an awsome shooter like some players, he can drive, hit the open pass, has the best shot fake I've ever seen. Hes just an all around Great team player. I've been a Huge Duke fan my entire life, and through all their players, I havent seen anyone who could shoot, or just flat out play like Redick can.
