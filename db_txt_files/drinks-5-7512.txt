This vodka is great because for the price, it is very tasty as a shooter or for a mixer. The Skyy vodka is especially good when mixed with cranberry juice because it allows me to disguise the Skyy vodka flavor into a flavorful beverage. I personally recommend this drink, but beware because you may not taste the vodka and its effects may creep up on you.
