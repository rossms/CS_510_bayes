This is cute with a lot of things that a young Simpsons fan can appreciate. I got this book many years ago, and as an older person, it got a bit stale, but it was very cool when I was younger. It's worth flipping through at the store before buying it to see if it's your thing or not. The phobia list is really cute, and actually pretty accurate. You might want to watch your kids if they emulate everything they see on television or read about--this book is for entertainment purposes only, and it's very important to remember that. Oh, and this makes a good bathroom reading book!
