I can't believe anyone would even think about rating JJ a 1 on a scale of 5. JJ's one of the top basketball players in college. Sure hes not Superman or anything but he plays just as good as anyone, not to mention the best freethrow shooter EVER. Just listen to Dick Vitale talk about him. Also, look at the drive this kid has on top of the talent. He might be rich but hes not lazy, just listen to how much hes done in the offseason. His game is 120% better than he was last year and he was amazing in Dukes 2003-04 season. I can't wait untill next year when they actually have a full roster!
