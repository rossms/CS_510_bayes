Out of all of the international cities I'd like to see, this one is at the top of my list. I have always loved Russian history, culture, and language, and Moscow's beautiful Constructivist architecture from the '30s and '40s is among the most imposing in the world. I would love to stand in Red Square and experience the pulse of life in this intense city. The Kremlin, Lenin's Tomb and the city's many parks are other reasons that Moscow should be a spot worth seeing. The person who said this city has too many Soviet monuments is closed-minded. If you don't like them, don't look at them. Simple as that.
