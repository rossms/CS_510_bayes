Brundtland became one of the first female prime ministers in the world! Now she leads WHO in the 80ies she leaded the UN-commision named after her self, dealing with the environment. She was the leading politician in the struggle towards Norwegian EU-memership. As we all know, she hadn't the luck on her side, unfortunately. I admire her for her work for more international co-operation, women rights including the right to abortion work, the struggle against tobacco other health cases environment.
