President George W. Bush will be a welcome relief from the slime and sludge we have had to put up with since Jan. 20, 1993. It will be a novelty not to hear the lies of Al Bore and his cohort, Bill Clinton. George W. Bush will surround himself with experts in all fields and he will stop the politicizing that goes on in Washington. Hopefully, he will get some cooperation from the DeomocRATS in getting legislation that will be wonderful to all society, from children to the elderly. He will accomplish in his first term all that Cllinton/Gore couldn't do in two terms.
