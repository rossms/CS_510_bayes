It's hard to look bad in anything made by J.Crew. The styles are classic enough to be worn year after year, yet they come out with slightly new patterns and colors annually. You could wear entirely J.Crew outfits and still look like you have a wide variety of clothing. The stores are very well organized, and I've never seen unhelpful staff at any of their locations. Definitely one of my favorite stores, and a terrific place for either men or women.
