Glavine has been a model of consistency for the Braves over the last ten or so years. He is not overpowering, but is always around the plate and is a great athlete (he was selected in the 4th round of the NHL draft). He is also a clubhouse leader who took a lot of heat for his strong union involvement during the strike. Even during that time, he never became embittered with the way the fans treated him or the media protrayed him. It was great that he was the starting and winning pitcher in the deciding game of the lone Braves World Series victory.
