I have had most all the other wireless companies and have worked for SPrint PCS and the coverage was HORRID and I never knew what to expect with my billing.I know every month what my bill will be with Alltel and the customer service I have recieved is great I have now turned my friends and family onto them as well and have alot of satisfaction with their plan and their coverage area...ALOT less dropped calls and static as well with their Network.They may not be as big as or as known as SPrint or AT+T but they are better in my eyes!
