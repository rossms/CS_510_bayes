UCD is a wonderful institution of higher learning, and is very respected in all of academia. Despite the enormous area it encompasses, the campus has this small-town feel (Davis is a small town itself). Classes are first rate and most professors are helpful to their students. As far as its graduate schools, they are top notch- especially its reknown medical school.
