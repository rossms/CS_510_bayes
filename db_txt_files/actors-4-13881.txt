Julia Roberts has been in some good movies. I liked her in Erin Brockovitch, Pretty Woman, My Best Friends Wedding and StepMom to name a few. I think for the most part she is a good actress. I think the press makes too much of a big deal out of her.As they do with quite a few actors, but I like in most of her roles.
