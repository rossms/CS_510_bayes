A few days ago, A Jewish woman showed me why she no longer lived in Israel. She showed me pictures of buses that had been blown up, pictures of the massacre at Jenin (seeing a decapitated palestinian baby made me shiver), pictures of an Israeli woman blown to pieces, and finally, pictures of her dead family. Israel is not a place I'd like to go with all that constant war going on.
