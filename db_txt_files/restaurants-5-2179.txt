I love Tim Horton's...I am addicted to their French vanilla cappucinos. And they have great cafe mochas too...and their muffins and Timbits donut holes kick a$$ too. I live in Columbus, Ohio, and I do believe there is a TH's on every other block (no lie). I need my Tim Horton's fix at least 3 days out of the week. What can I say...they just offer great quality at reasonable prices. Their coffess beat Starbuck's overpriced, blah-tasting coffees anytime!
