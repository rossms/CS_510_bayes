Pizza Bolis tastes like Papa Johns Pizza at a considerably lower price. Its saucey and cheesy and the dough tastes is just right! Its very yummy! And much cheaper! There was one in Sterling VA but suprisingly a year later maybe 2003 the same place (Pizza Bolis) with the same pizza changed its name to Pizza Palace but the pizza remained to be the same great tasting value sized pizza. You can get a Large 1 topping for only $5.99 thats so cheap!! A medium for only $4.99!! And the list goes on!! This is my favorite pizza joint and its soo goooood!! mmmmm!!
