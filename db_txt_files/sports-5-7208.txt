There have been a handful of athletes with Michael Jordan's athletic ability to play in the NBA (David Thompson, Dominique Wilkins, Julius Erving). There have also been a handful with his intense desire to win, and knowledge of the game (Isiah Thomas, Larry Bird, John Havlicek). But there has never been anyone who has had the entire package - elite athleticism combined with a single minded focus on winning. This man was the greatest to ever play the game.
