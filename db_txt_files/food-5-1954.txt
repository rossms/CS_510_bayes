Shock Tarts are my favorite candies. They are the best candies ever made, and I think I can tell you why. They are so nice and chewy, and tart, but not so tart and you need to drink water with it. They are just the greatest candies ever made, and they deserve so much credit. The Wonka Company makes these.
