Went to the premeir, and in all honesty, I walked out. I left feeling disappointed and quite embarrassed. I love The Nightmare Before Christmas, and am a Tim Burton fan, but The Corpse Bride, heh, it was almost as if Tim was justing showing off. I give this a rating of 4 because the animation was absolutely flawless, smooth and amazing. The only thing that drew this movie down, was the story. Danny Elfman too, I was expecting much better from him. : ( sorry guys.
