I LOVE MIAMI! The BEST NIGHTLIFE, south beach, coconut grove it's off the hook!!! Warm weather year round, plenty of nice places to shop, and lots of nice restaurants. The beaches are nice. The people here are gorgeous and the women dress really nice. But the people can be really fake and shallow. Some of them get too caught up in South Beach scene. I dont know if it's the best place to raise children, but for a young person, or someone unmarried, or for people who's children have grown up and left home I think it's a gerat place.
