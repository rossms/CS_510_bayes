Who needs guys like Jerry Stackhouse when you can have more humble and modest players (excluding Rasheed)? I was crushed, as a piston fan when I saw traded Jerry Stackhouse and Christian Latner. I thought we were dead but he knew that Jerry had peaked and Christian was old, basicly my biased opinion is that Joe Dumars is the best general manager in the NBA
