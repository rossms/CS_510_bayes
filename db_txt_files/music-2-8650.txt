I'm a Nirvana fan, but this song was really annoying me for a while. It just isn't one of their better songs, and after hearing it on the radio and MTV every hour for about 4 months I couldn't stand it anymore! The video isn't anything special either, just a whole bunch of old clips. Most overhyped song and video of 2002.
