A pretty good insight into the life of great Artist Frida Kahlo. Here's the plot and gist of it: Some spoilers ahead. Frida Kahlo is a unique and talented artist with a crazy life. She gets into a gruesome bus accident, has to have painful surgery, marries a famous man, finds out her husband is cheating on her with many women, goes to New York, feels lonely, has affairs of her own, goes to France, falls in love with Leon Trotsky, Communist affair starts, and I won't tell you the rest, but it's very tragic. It will probably make you cry.
