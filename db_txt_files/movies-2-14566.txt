What was all the hype about??? This movie was a huge disappointment. Think of the entire plot. Anyone could've written this movie. Guy's plane crashes before he marries the love of his life. Guy's stuck on an island for four years. Guy makes it home. Guy finds that his love is married to another man. That's all that happens. Throw in a great actor (Tom Hanks) and make some nice touches (Wilson, the pocket watch) and that's the movie. Most of the movie is VERY BORING!!! I think I connected more with Wilson than I did with Tom Hanks. Wilson is what gives this movie 2 stars instead of 1. Rest in Peace Wilson.
