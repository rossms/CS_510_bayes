I give this swine begrudging respect cause there is no denying his greatness....On the field. Off the field he went to great lengths to bring shame upon the great(my words) Tiger organization, his teamates, and to human beings in general. Bonds has nothing on this guy in the biggest pr#ck in Baseball history sweepstakes.
