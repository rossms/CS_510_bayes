Alabama had a great season. They were 9-0 before LSU handed them their first loss in the season in an SEC thriller. Then Auburn sacked the Tide 28-18 in a bad day for the Alabama offense especially the O-line and Croyle getting sacked 11 times. Speaking of the offense, it was plagued by losing their best target, Tyrone Pothro (sp?). They will roll over Texas Tech in the AT&T Cotton Bowl.
