Well, Well, Well. I heard that Penn State is amazing in academics, it has a nice camp, it offers many things. However, you guys forgot something. It has the biggest due-paying alumni association in the WORLD. I am an international student who graduated from PSU. Believe it or not, you will find PSU alumni meeting in all countries (almost). Penn Staters are everywhere. To be honest, PSU is one of the best in the world!
