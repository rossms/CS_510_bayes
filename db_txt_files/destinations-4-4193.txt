This is a nice city to live in, not much as a place to visit, but it has improved over the years. There are a number of good places to eat downtown and some decent bars. Fairly sleepy, but definitely a decent place. If you like a clean city with nice affordable housing near a lot of outdoor activities, it's a good place-- just don't expect a BIG city atmosphere, it is really just a small town with big city money.
