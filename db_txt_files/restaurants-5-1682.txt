A real treat here in Lawrence, KS. I highly recommend trying one - not just an ordinary sandwhich. I don't mean to say that it's going to knock your socks off either, but they are very good and typically run by people who actually care about their customers and the store. Restaurant is always clean, people are always friendly, I always enjoy my lunch.
