Arguably one of the best quarterbacks in NFL history. As a kid, he was my favorite player. I lived in Detroit at the time, but moved to California with my parents and we went to a 49ers game and saw the man in action. He won four Super Bowls and 3 MVP awards throughout his career. He made the 49ers a team to reckon with.
