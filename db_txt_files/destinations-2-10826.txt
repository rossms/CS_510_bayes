Not bad, but not great. I've gotten two or three packs of these, and they always seem to go stale less than a day later. Kind of similar to Camel Lights in terms of strength, but definitely lacking quality. Not smooth at all. Only thing good about them is they're cheaply priced and have a good brun on them...not too slow, not too fast.
