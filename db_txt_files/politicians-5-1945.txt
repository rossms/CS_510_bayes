Smart, fair, honest, with a vision. Cannot ask for more than that. Unfortunately, too many people with venom in their hearts and blinders on their eyes may vote a good man out of office in '02. Winston Churchill was also voted out just as he could have helped reshape Europe after the war. Hopefully he has enough time before election to make a personal connection with groups who don't like OUTCOME of recent election. Otherwise, his public career is likely over, and Florida is worse off for it.
