j.j. redick is an awesome shooter, that's a given. his D is so-so and he usually gets a good defender on him. He has been using his outside game and taking it up a notch due to the fact that he can fake and drive and if he can see the lane he will now drive instead of passing it up for a turnover. HIs overall game has went up since he came to duke and now he is becomeing more of a complete player.
