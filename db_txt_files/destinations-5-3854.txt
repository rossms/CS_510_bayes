This is the best city in Canada!!! Taxes are the lowest, no provincial income taxes and vandalism is non existant. They have a great park system in the downtown area and it is a very prosperous city of a million inhabitants where unemployment is next to nil. For the rest come here and see for yourselves. Did I mention the northern lights and the river valley?
