I love pictionary! My family and I started playing it when we were on vacation one summer and have been playing it since then. It's best when the game gets really heated and everyone starts yelling at each other saying his/her team guessed the picture first. Everyone should try it with family, friends, or somewhere where you're trying to meet new people. It provides laughs for hours!
