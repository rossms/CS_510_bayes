Tulsa metro is almost 900,000 so it is big. Clifton may have went overboard. But I have been to alot of places and Tulsa has a good feel to it. It is my favorite city. So if your going this way be sure to stop in Tulsa I will agree with Clifton this city does ROCK!! By the way Glad-ImNotMackBrown needs to move he must be like 80
