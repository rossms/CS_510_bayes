A monstrous athlete,phenomenally quick for a man of his size and power,an inspirational leader(of a Superbowl defense),a bringer of devastation and chaos,striking uncertainty and fear into the hearts of the opposition he devoured with such relish;to quarterbacks,he must have seemed like a tiger riding in on a whirlwind.Taylor was certainly the best linebacker i've seen.
