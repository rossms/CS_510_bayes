I had already known before playing the game that there would not be many surprises since the theme of the game was primarily just plain old racing. It was really the smoothness of the graphics that made me very impressed. I have an average 3-D accelerator card with just 4MB of memory and I was expecting a somewhat choppy sequence of screenshots. To my surprise, it was really smooth. I'd recommend this game to anyone who's really into 3-D racing.
