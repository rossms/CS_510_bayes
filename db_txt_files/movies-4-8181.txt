What works about this movie, and what so many other gross movies don't seem to get, is that you care about the characters. You want Ben Stiller's character to find and get back together with Mary. You admire the fact that Mary is so caring for her mentally retarded brother. Because of that, you're willing to forgive the characters their mistakes, which yes, are a little gross, but very funny. I don't usually like movies of this type, but Something About Mary had me laughing.
