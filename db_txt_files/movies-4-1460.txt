Finally! A action movie with women fighting and being into martial arts! We get to see not only Vivica A. Fox show off her great fighting moves, But Lucy Liu with a samurai sword, and did I forget Daryl Hannah as a psychotic nurse? This film isn't gory much. Critics say it is, but the violence and the blood is unbelievably cheesy. The blood spewing out from cut limbs is practically orange! And sadly, Vivica A. Fox doesn't get much time in this film. But it was well-directed and different and more creative than other action films.
