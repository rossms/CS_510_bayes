Being a Knick's fan, it wasn't easy seeing Jordan talk crap to Starks, and get under his skin. Let's face it. Nobody could do that like Jordan. Because he WAS better, they knew it, he knew it, everyone KNEW it. My husband was a Jordan fan, and I nearly was too, truly, honestly enjoyed watching this man play, he was miraculous. Would have been cool if Jordan could go back in time, and played Dr. J in his prime.
