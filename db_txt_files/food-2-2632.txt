I used to love Hershey's plain chocolate bars. But over the years I think they changed their recipe for the worse. Maybe it was to save money, or maybe they thought they were improving their product. I'm sorry to say they were wrong. They had to mess with a sucessful and delicious product. Now they lost my vote. Better luck next time Hershey's.
