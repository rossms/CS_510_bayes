From personal driving experience this car is great. Cupholders, storage galore. Love the table. Can even put ice in a storage box. Instrumentation is very good. I don't like that the window buttons are near steering wheel. Major problem is power. They need to offer a much more powerful engine. The V-tee engine could be used.
