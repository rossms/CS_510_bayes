I saw him play the Utah Jazz in Orlando in November, AMAZING is a good word for it. He had a cast on his hand, and still poured in 39 points and had about 7 assists and 10 rebs. An unbelievable talent who shows good maturity for his age. Will be the team leader even when Grant Hill comes back. A Superstar was born.....
