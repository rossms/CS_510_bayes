I honestly could not understand the hype over this movie. It wasn't all that original and Robin Williams cannot pull off drama. While the idea of the movie has potential, I did not feel any true inspiration from the script nor did I feel any true relation to the characters. Something about the characters and dialogue as it was written seemed so forced and unnatural.
