I sold Girl Scout cookies when you had to carry them door-to-door by the case. We didn't have a lot growing up, but being able to indulge in a Thin Mint was a real treat. The ultimate 'to die for' cookie - good thing the Girl Scouts only come around once a year with these tempting treats. I missed the cookie drive two years ago, and the first though that went through my head, when reality set in. But what about the 'Thin Mints'? I survived, but only with the realization that 'Thin Mints' would be back!!!
