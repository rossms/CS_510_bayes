A great teen movie. I am far past my teens and for whatever reason, I still love these types of movie. Jason Biggs portrays the loser you love to perfection. His dancing scene was beyond hilarious, and the apple pie scene needs no explanation, unbelievably funny. And then, at band camp... A hilarious coming of age movie with sincere characters that epitomize the teenage experience!
