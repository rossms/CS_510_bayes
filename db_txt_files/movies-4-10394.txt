Like The Naked Gun , your opinion of this movie really depends on how much tolerance you have for stupidty. Sometimes, plain stupidity just makes for great comedy, and this is no different. This hilarious version of Robin Hood was great to watch, and had a lot of funny parts, espescially the blind man chopping up the pole. I reccomend this to anyone who liked The Naked Gun - its hilarious!
