I ended up on this site because I was doing some research on Jesse Jackson. I signed on thinking this would be fun and helpful and engaging. I tried to vote and all the votes ended up yes no matter what I clicked. I found the comments here ranged from outright ignornance of current events and of history and outright hateful and indignant. Not helpful at all and not even in touch with America. I will withdraw my membership.
