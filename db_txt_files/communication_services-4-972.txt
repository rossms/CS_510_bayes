The service is absolutely excellent all over the east and midwest, never tried it out west. My phone always without fail has better reception than my boyfriend's Sprint service phone - no matter where we are. The thing that is really bad though, is that it is a little pricey for the nationwide plan compared to, say, Cingular. A HUGE drawback is that you can't download new ringtones, and every feature you can think of costs extra money per month...nothing is included, not even caller ID or voicemail.
