Could possibly be one of the young great actresses of today. Great acting ability in some great movies, but then absolute dud in some forgettable movies too. Sometimes reminds me of Grace Kelly. Tall, attractive, elegant and classy, but then there's the grungy, messed up hair, no bra Gwyneth who needs to stay home. Good actress with so much potential.
