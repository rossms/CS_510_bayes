Tiananmen Square is impressive for its size, historical significance, and people watching. When I visited, the huge portrait of Mao was present (and I assume it remains) as well as a large digital clock counting down the years, days, hours, and seconds when Macau was to be returned from the Portuguese. I tried to get some Red Army grunts to point their guns at me for a photo op with my hands in the air, but they wouldn't play along. Perhaps others will have more luck.
