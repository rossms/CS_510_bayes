so disapointing. An uttershame to the Matrix series. Theres just too much philophsyical, religious things and just no enough hard core sci-fi. The scene I really didn't understand was the the whole 'dance floor' scene. The only positive thing i can say about it is that it interdouced some new okay charcters... whoopie.
