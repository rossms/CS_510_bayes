For those of you who believe Ryan was overrated... you are fools. Take a peak at his lifetime ERA, 3.19. His high number of losses is attributed to the teams he played for, over which he had litte control. If he had played for run producing teams, he would likely have flirted with 400 wins. To illustrate my point, in 1972 he had an ERA of 2.28 and 9 shutouts (how many pitchers have had 9 shutouts in one season?) and lost 16 games!!! If he had been with a good team he would have flirted with 30 wins.
