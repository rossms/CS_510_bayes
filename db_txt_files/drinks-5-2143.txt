Iced tea is OK. Splenda is a great improvement over the things that taste nasty. But the two together (Peach is my favorite) are wonderful. It always tastes good, even after more than a couple of glasses a day (which cannot be said for most of the other diet products out there.) Now, if I could just find it more easily!
