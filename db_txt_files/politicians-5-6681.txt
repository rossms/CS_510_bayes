I think that all of you people should be ashamed of yourself. NOBODY is perfect especially not you people. For one How can u call someone racist and talk trash about them at the same time. You are being just as bad trash talking someone. Also you have to understand him being a black man i think that you might be scared that he might actually do better than YOU. HE is very intelligent and i wish he was still running because even if he didnt make it... i would feel good too see him still standing for what he believes in.
