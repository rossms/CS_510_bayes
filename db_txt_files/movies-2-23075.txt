Sorry, but after 3 great Star Wars movies, this one is just poor. Jake Lloyd (Annakin) leads the race with his 3 facial expressions, followed closely by Jar-Jar Binks and a pod-race that goes on far too long. Following that, computer generated effects that obviously are computer generated, and a villian who was born to be evil (I mean honestly, could you see a member of Darth Maul's species as a Librarian?!). Luckily the following 'Attack of the Clones' made up for all the mistakes in this one.
