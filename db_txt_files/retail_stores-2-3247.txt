On one occasion the employee would not honor a sale price on used DVD's even though the sign clearly said that all formats were on sale. The clerk would't even take the time to look at their own ad. When I wrote a letter of complaint to Blockbuster headquarters, I received no response. On another occasion, the employee forgot to remove the security strip from a rental DVD, so when I got home, I could not open the case. I had to make a trip back to the store to have it removed, and received no apology, or compensation.
