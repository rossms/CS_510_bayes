I haven't seen Marmaduke for years since it was dropped from our local newspapers. For a long time, it was a strip that I barely noticed -- until my family had a Great Dane. True, it's not a hilarious comic strip but it amazed me to see how many of the traits (that I'd thought exaggerated) in Marmaduke were very familiar after having a Great Dane in the family. To me, it's one of the strips that generally make you smile rather than one that elicits gales of laughter. Sometimes heartwarming.
