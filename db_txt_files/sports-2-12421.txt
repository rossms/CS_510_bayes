A good team, but with all the alleged corruption and questionable recruiting tactics, they should never lose. You would think they would pay a member of the Brazilian National Soccer to kick field goals. It's almost comical to see them blow a big game every year due to a missed field goal. Don't particularly like the fans (was treated rudely by the FSU fans at Joke Campbell Stadium in Talla-ass-hole as a visiting Temple fan)
