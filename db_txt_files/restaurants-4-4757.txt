There were a few Houlihan's scattered around the Northest. The one I used to go to was at the West Farms Mall which is on the West Hartford/Farmington line in Ct. I had fun there and thought the food and drinks were good, and priced the same as any other comparable chain. This particular Houlihan's was doing great business but the other ones in the Northeast were failing so they decided to close them all down.
