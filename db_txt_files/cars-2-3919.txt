Don't be fooled by the Cadillac wreath and crest, the Escalade is nothing more than a gussied up Chevy (or GMC?). GM could at least try and differentiate the Escalade by offering a Northstar version. It basically has the same engine and underpinnings as its lesser sister models, go for an import model instead!
