I have not seen a lot of Burt Lancaster's movies. The ones I have seen, he is a good actor. he was great as the scoundrel in Elmer Gantry. and in The Birdman of Alcatraz. I also liked his small role in Field of Dreams as the kindly doctor who had dreams of being a baseball player. I liked the roles I did see him in.
