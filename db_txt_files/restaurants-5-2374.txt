Jack, I absolutely love your Pannidos (except the price) The new sourdough Club is excellent (execpt the price) You have the best salads right next to Wendys. Your 2 deep fried tacos with mystery-meat paste for 99 cents are addicting. Overall I love your menu, it's the most diversified fast food menu in Southern California. I do have a few complaints. Bacon-Bacon Cheeseburger is very salty (gross). Jumbo Jacks should be 99 cents. Bring back the philly Cheese Steaks and the triple ultimate cheeseburger. Other than that way to go Jack.
