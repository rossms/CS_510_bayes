Swanson was brilliant as the aging film star who hired a screenwriter (Holden) to assist in her comeback. After they became so close, he thought he could manipulate her, but he found out otherwise. It was almost like these characters played themselves. Eerie but fascinating look at the loss of fame with now very classic scenes.
