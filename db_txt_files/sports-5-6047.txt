UPDATE: I went to the Nova - Lasalle game on 12/22 and Foye looked great. The boy can leap. He led the team in boards, which is a feat at 6'2" (he looked shorter than that in person). I didn't know he could shoot off the dribble as well as he can. OC: Probably my favorite guard in college hoops right now. Known amongst NBA scouts for his heart, conditioning, and versatility, Foye can defend forwards 6+ inches taller than him with ease. He can create his own shot and can bang in the paint. Averaged 20 ppg in the tourney last year, logging lots of minutes at 3 different positions.
