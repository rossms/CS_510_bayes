I am not sure if this is on the right list because it is much more than Pizza. It has a pretty good menu with pizza being the specialty. Most Pizza chains I know don't offer other Italian food, beef, chicken and Sea Food. The food was good but I was not feeling well so that might be the reason why I only gave it four stars.
