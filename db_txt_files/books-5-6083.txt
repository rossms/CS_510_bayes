The first 'faction' novel in the Nathan Heller series. In this one, the Irish-Jewish PI solves the shooting of Chicago Mayor Cermak, who was standing next to President Roosevelt when he was gunned down. Heller connects historical figures from the Chicago mob to the hit and when things get too rough, his real-life world boxing champ buddy, Barney Ross takes care of business.
