One of the better big-chain burger joints, with the flame-broiling making the difference.The extra menu is good promotion for food you may not normally want to try as full-size. Most everything else offered is satisfying at least, drink refills are a definite plus. Slightly less of a kid's world than McDonald's, but not by much.
