Maybe three years ago I went on a trip out west, visiting Vegas, Grand Canyon and San Fran. The Canyon was by far the most exciting. I didn't make it all the way down to the plateau, but even not doing that it was a really tough climb up. It's exciting and beautiful. I only wish I could've spent more time there.
