Mary Poppins and the others in the P.L. Travers series predate the popular movie. In some ways, the books are very different - this Mary Poppins is a plain, often unapproachable nanny, far from sweet and lovable. But she introduces the children in her care to wonderfully magical characters and experiences -- one of my favourites was the night they joined her to help hang stars. Although the Mary Poppins movie is one of my alltime favourites, I like the books even better. Check them out!
