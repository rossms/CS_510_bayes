The Discworld series are without doubt the funniest and most imaginative series out there, no matter what the theme. The world itself is unique (you have to read it to believe it), and its characters, from the witches to wizards to dwarfs to Death neatly fit in it. The plot and subplotlines are hilarious, and worth a second read and more. The world really could use more people like Terry Pratchett.
