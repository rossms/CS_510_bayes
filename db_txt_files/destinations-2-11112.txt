This isn't really my idea of a nice day at the beach. Too crowded, huge condo's lining the beach front like a wall of concrete. Of course it is certainly a good place to look for eye candy but that's the only real attraction in my mind. Oh and if you don't like crowds then definitely don't go during their motorcycle week. Youch!! nothing but bikes and people in every single nook of town. It'll take you forever just to go a few blocks.
