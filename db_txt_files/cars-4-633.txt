I rode a '96 KDX200 in enduros for two seasons. My bike was highly modified for going fast. The KDX is a great bike for new riders. Stock it's power is somewhat docile, but a few modifications can really improve performance. If I hadn't found such a good deal on a GasGas EC250, I would've bought a KDX220.
