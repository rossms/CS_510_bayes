This guy took a Nebraska team that won only 3 games in 1961 and got them 9 wins the following season, including a bowl victory. He then went on to win back-to-back championships in the '70's. For coaching for only slightly over a decade, this man accomplished alot. He put the University of Nebraska back onto the map.
