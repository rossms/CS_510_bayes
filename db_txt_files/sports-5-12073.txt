Cadillac is the staple to Auburn's high ranking. They are guaranteed to be in a bowl now, but they're aiming higher with this man. I'm sure that they will win the SEC Championship with him. This Tiger cerainly deserves to have an individual trophy as competitors have a tough time tackling him. To me, he is better than Adrian Peterson and Michigan's Chris Perry of last year. Do not be surprised that he will win more than three individual trophies.
