I htink old navy is a great place to get cheap clothes that are pretty much in style... How ever, the quality is not wonderful.The clothes do hold up very well, though and offer cute cloting fo a reasonable price. I love their shorts, your butt doesn't hang out of them like in some stores. The graphic tees are cute and feature vintage style printing, which in in now. I have always found the environment to be very welcoming and the staff to be very friendly- great store.
