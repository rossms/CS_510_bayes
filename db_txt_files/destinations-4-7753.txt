Not only a nice place to go if you are a tourist because it's attractive and there are many other sites to see in the immediate area, but also a nice place to go even if you live in Boston. There are some decent bars that are right there, in the summertime they have open air concerts just across the street, and there are also some good restaurants as well. Not to mention that the street performers which are fun and the shopping in general. I'd say it's a little crowded but then hey it's a city and just about anyplace like that is going to be busy so at least go someplace decent.
