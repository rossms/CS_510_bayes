He's not that great. He had 666 yards last season, which Tony Gonzalez by comparison had nearly double that, 1258 yards. Similarly Antonio Gates scored more than twice as many TDs as Shockey, 6 compared to 13. Shockey is nowhere near the level of player that they are. Statistically, even Alge Crumpler's a better reciever, and obviously Alge is the better blocker too. There are so many better tight ends in this league it's worth taking note, and he's a punk. If he played to his talent level he could be about a 4.
