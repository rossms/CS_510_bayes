The Inferno was really interesting and creative, but it gets long after awhile. Purgatory is a little more lively and still creative, but not as visual. Paradisio was really weird and dumb and I don't know where he got those ideas, but the idea of God being beams of light was lame, but I guess nobody has anything better.
