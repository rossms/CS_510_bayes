Easy reading but subtle insightful comments makes this book ideal for both school and pleasure reading. The heavy issue of slavery balances the naive point of view (and thus humorous) Huck Finn has, makes a well rounded novel. It was neat to compare what I got out of it as a child and what I got out of it as a young adult.
