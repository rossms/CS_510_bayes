In my opinion the Columbus Zoo is one of only 3 Five Star quality zoos in the United States (for some strange reason the state of Ohio has all 3 of them in Cincinnati,Toledo & Columbus). I would rate it the third best zoo of the 3 and consequently the third best zoo in the country. In my opinion only the Cincinnati Zoo (which is by far the best I ever visited) and Toledo Zoo are better.
