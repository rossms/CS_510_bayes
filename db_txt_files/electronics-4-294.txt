Great deal for what i got it for it was ALOT cheaper then Panasonic.. My parents decided to igonre me and get that phone and i go this one... It works ALOT better then theirs i can go anywhere without breaking up (except the wireless internet ponit)My parents phone always breaks up even if your one room away.. Only thing bad about this phone is it looks bad (needs to have better style and 2.4 ghz gets in the way if you have wireless internet point in house...
