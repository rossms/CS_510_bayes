Now that it has been 10 years, I am a little more objective. It is a very good (but not perfect) film. Terrific action storytelling in non-linear time. Great cast, good script (although it's not for the weak.) The Dogs still rule. . .it's still an awesome crime film with a twist. Love the gaudy 70's soundtrack. . .
