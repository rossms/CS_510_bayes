Good change-of-pace beer from Thailand. (Although I don't recommend drinking to much beer in the dead-heat of Thailand. . .you'll dehydrate very fast if you aren't paying attention.) Singha hints at a malt-liqour flavor but not enough to be irritating. Seems to have a higher alcohol content for a beer. Light in color and goes well with any Thai dish (but I recommend anything with chicken.) A good beer-experience for someone who likes beer and wants to expand his or her horizons.
