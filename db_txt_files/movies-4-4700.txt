I took my 10 year old daughter to see this after she begged me for a month. To me, it just didn't look like an interesting movie at all. Who would want to see a bunch of kids digging holes all day long. I didn't think there would be much of a story line, but there was. I thought it was a really good movie for kids. There wasn't a lot of violence in it at all and the story line was actually pretty good.
