I think that this album contains many songs that stray away from their usually upbeat tones, they went for soemthing darker, deeper, melodic and haunting, at least out of the songs I've heard from it. Anthony Kiedis's voice melts into the melodies and mixes well with the music. Some have used the term mature to dsecribe this venture, but it's not quite the word I'm looking for, but close. I love the Chili Pepper's signature upbeat feel, but if you want to hear something a little different from the Chili Peppers, this is definately worth a try.
