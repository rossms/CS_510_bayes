Roald Dahl has a wonderful imagination. This one is good. A sweet boy named Charlie wins a golden ticket to go to a chocolate factory,and win a lifetime supply of chocolate. He along with four other kids get a tour of the factory and meet Willy Wonka the owner. He has Oompa Loompas help run the factory. The other four kids are brats, each of the other four kids end up getting in trouble at the factory. My kids enjoyed both this book and the movie. Charlie the good kid ends up with the best prize of all.
