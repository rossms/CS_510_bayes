In terms of raw talent and rushing style, which is both speedy and powerful, I like Deuce better than most NFL runningbacks, including people like the over-rated Clinton Portis and Tomlinson. Deuce has put up great numbers with a terrible o-line, so how is that any different from Tomlinson? If he has just one season where he really gets things done, I'll rate him a 5.
