I think he has finally balanced his recruiting with his bench coaching abilities. I was very down on his recruiting. I have always believed he is the best bench coach in the country. He is too impulse when it comes to recruiting though, and my biggest gripe is his need to change a players natural talents to fit his system rather than using them to the team's advantage.
