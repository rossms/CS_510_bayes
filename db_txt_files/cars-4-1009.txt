BTW camrys are the most sought after car on the market.... the chop shop market that is.... these cars are stolen like no other especially the older ones ; my aut lost hers that way, and my step mom's got robbed. they have no security system, and they arn't the most exciting thing around. but when it comes to reliabilty, the only thing that beets it are the accord, civic, and or corolla... but hondas are overrated, and the corolla is just as blase as it's big brother.
