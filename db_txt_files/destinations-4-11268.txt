I really enjoyed going to Niagara Falls..the Canadian side is simply breathtaking and the Maids of the Midst tour was fascinating. I also enjoyed the walking tour which told about all of the attempts to go over the Falls..There are plenty of junky stores and expensive touristy crap like in any tourist town, do your research and you will find a lot of hidden treasures in the area, some great restaurants and intriguing shops.
