I have had no problems with my '02 Mitsu. Eclipse GS since I bought it in November of '01. I'm going on my 3rd year of ownership, and not one glitch. It's fun, quick and agile as far as handeling is concerned. My only qualm is its weather performance. I would recommend getting all-weather high-performance tires and not the Bridgestone Potenzas that come w/ the vehicle off the lot.
