A state with some wonderful visual images- and some good cities like Portland and Eugene- the state has to come to grips with the ultra liberal region west of the cascades, and the extremely conservative region to the east of those mountains- it seems like if you are a free thinker here- you are threatened by the 'Bill O'Reilly' legions, which can be rather violent and reactionary.
