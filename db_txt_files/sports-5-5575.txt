Asheville, NC to the fullest. Shad can flat out play. He's a defensive glove and can score at will. I remember him on the playground back home and playing at Clyde A. Erwin. Shad has always had a knack for drawing negative attention but he has always risen above it. Fact of the matter is he was the best player in the draft pound per pound. To bad he couldn't have been at Charlotte, NC. He, Felton, and May could have been the trifecta the Bobacts have dreamed of. Keep ya head up Shad, something those outside the DYNASTY will never understand.
