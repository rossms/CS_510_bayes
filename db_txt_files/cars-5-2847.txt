I have a 2000 mustang and I love it. I think that Mustangs are the nicest cars on the road, and for who ever said that Mustangs are for hicks does not know what they are talking about because I am a latina so I am not a hick. Mustangs are beautiful, fun to drive, and will never give you a lot of trouble if they are built right and treated right. If you have any comments on wht I have just said then e-mail me at Joannf574@cs.com
