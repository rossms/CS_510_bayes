I don't know what it is about oreo's that keeps me attracted to them, perhaps it is the icing, or maybe it's the fact that they are made even more delicious when eaten with milk. Whatever the case, they are the best cookies since the invention of the cookie. They are also not as fattening as many other brands of cookies, that's a plus.
