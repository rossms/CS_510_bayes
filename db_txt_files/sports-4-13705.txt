How long do you think it will take before Marty regrets taking the job? Without a doubt, he is one of the better coaches over the last 20 years - in the group below Parcells, Gibbs, and Walsh. Sure, he never took the Browns or Chiefs to the Super Bowl, but he enjoyed tremendous success with both teams. His past accomplishments certainly give him credibility with the players. And, as Director of Football Operations, he is able to avoid the friction he felt with Carl Peterson in KC. However, I think he will long for that friction the more he works for Daniel Snyder.
