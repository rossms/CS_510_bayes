Are these other posters talking about this book, or dimwitted and ridiculous movies they've seen lately? The Time Machine is an interesting premise as a book, but as usual, Wells can't figure out how to get words on the page. This tome is OK for the junior set, the sci-fi crowd and other low-brow types of limited intelligence and imagination.
