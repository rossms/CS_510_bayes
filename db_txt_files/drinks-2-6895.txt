Unfortunately popular by name, as with Jose Cuervo. Towards the bottom of the 100% agave tequilas, but fortunately it is at least now 100% agave, not expensive, and better than Jose Cuervo or Sauza. Too much of a 'dirty' (heavy?) taste to me. They must add caramel or something to this, or it just gets too much flavor from the barrels. I'd even recommend Cuervo Tradicional over this. People saying this is the best they've tried obviously haven't tried any premium tequila. Also adding the name 'Cuervo' is not correct. It's simply '1800'.
