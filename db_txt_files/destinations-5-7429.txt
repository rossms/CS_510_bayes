A terrific city. There's plenty to do: shopping (go to the Kaufhaus Des Westerns, aka: the KaDeWe), restaurants (you're sure to find something you like), a constant nightlife (actually I never did go to any bars, but I have heard about them). Plus, it's a very historic city. Be sure to visit the Checkpoint Charlie museum to see lots of info on the Berlin Wall. Basically, I wish I was back there.
