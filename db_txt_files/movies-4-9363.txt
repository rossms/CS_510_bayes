I liked it. It was entertaining. Picture the (not so) dumb blonde in college getting dumped right before graduation by her boyfriend because he's too good for her - he's been admitted to Harvard Law. She's out to prove that he's not good enough for her, so guess who else shows up at Harvard Law. Realistic? No! Lighthearted and something to laugh at? Yes! Certainly worth the 3 or 4 bucks for a rental.
