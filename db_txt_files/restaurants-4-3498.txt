I really like Pizza Hut's pan pizza. It is also a kid friendly restaurant that my 3 and 4 year old boys enjoy. There's always a cup of crayons on the table, special kids' cups with lids (thank goodness for the lids) and the service is usually quick and friendly. My youngest son (who's role model appears to be Rosemary's Baby ) will even sit down like a normal child and eat his pizza.
