I always liked Alice Cooper, but I really thought he had lost his edge and was musicially finished for the most part. However,I took a chance on this album and was blown away. It is the most rocking effort he has had in years, and blows away any other hard rock album I have heard this year, or for that matter in a number of years. If you don't own this album, you simply don't like hard rock and metal. Good to see a real legend still doing something great. Plus he is touring, the tour dates at www.spitfirerecords.com right now, for the next leg of his tour. I am totally there!
