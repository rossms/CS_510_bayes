After reading Lamb's first book She's Come Undone, which I thought was very good yet to predictable, I immediately started This Much I know is True, which is a at first a little slow, It wasn't until around page 150 of this 897 page novel that I was consumed. The story of identical twin brothers one a schizophrenic, the other mentally well- well sort of. Written well, with well formed characters. The book offers insight, a bit of humor, tragedies, love, and healing. LONG book...definitely worth the read though.
