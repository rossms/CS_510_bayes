I think that JuniorMints are the greatest thing that ever happened to movie theatres, and to my secret stash of candy, and because Jimmy Buffett says so...*where did juniormints go at the movies, I DONT WANT A 12 POUND NESTLE CRUNCH FOR 25 DOLLARS, I WANT JUNIOR MINTS, we need more fruitcakes in this world, LESS BAKERS*...so yes, I would have to say that every CANADIAN, cause I AM CANADIAN, should have a secret stash of Junior Mints on hand, just incase the movie theatres dont have them......and that's all i have to say today......cheers!
