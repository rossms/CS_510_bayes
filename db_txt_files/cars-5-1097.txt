I'm on my second one, so I'm a repeat customer. They handle well, they get great mileage, and they're damned reliable. They can stand up to the worst treatment--even with problems, they still start up and drive. They've very tough. And despite their size, they can handle water on the roads that some cars couldn't, just because of this insatiable will to live they seem to have. But both Civics I've had have had A/C problems early on. I don't know what's up with that.
