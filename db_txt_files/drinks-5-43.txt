Guinness Stout is my personal number one beer of choice, though I fully understand why it is not the brew for everyone. As a cream stout, the taste is definitely robust, filling and hoppier (ie more bitter) than most beers. This is just peachy with me as I do not drink beer to satisfy a thirst, but rather to enjoy the experience (much like a fine wine).
