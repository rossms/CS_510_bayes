I enjoyed it. I felt it was a good summation to the prequel trilogy and answered alot of questions. I liked seeing how things came together even though you knew they were going to happen. It was cool to see all the little pieces fall into place. I was dissappointed with the darth vadar transformation scene. I expected more from that and for it to be longer. His ending scream was weak also. Otherwise a sweet movie!
