Although the length of Ayn Rand's novel The Fountainhead may be initially intimidating (due to it's length), I find it was a one-of-a-kind work, very deep and truly inspiring. Hidden behind pages of dialogue between somewhat complicated characters,lies truth, and this truth is what has made The Fountainhead such a success. I admit, it isn't for everyone, but I would strongly suggest it, in saying it could be beneficial to your overall outlook on life.
