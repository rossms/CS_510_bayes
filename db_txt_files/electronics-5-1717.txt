I rated this VCR a 5 because I think the programming is very easy to do. I love the way you can fly back and forth using the arrow buttons to change things without having to back out and start at the beginning again. Because the date and time are not connected, you can't make a mistake and accidentally change the intended recording date as you manipulate the time (which has happened to me a number of times with my other VCR). I have to admit that my husband struggles with the programming, though, and he always needs me to help him set the timer- something I find very annoying!
