I couldn't believe the profanity in this movie. I caught about 20 minutes of this on cable the other day, and there is enough cussing in those twenty minutes to fill up fifty more movies. Even disregarding that, it's still not very good, and it's certainly not very funny. There are a couple of good moments, like the mock lightsaber battle near the end (with Mark Hamill himself making an appearance) but in a movie that's an hour and a half long, a few good moments doesn't mean much.
