If you want to see John Malkovich at his best, pass up Dangerous Liasons and skip right to In The Line of Fire , where he plays the villan-the antagonist. The protagonist for this highly recommended movie is Clint Eastwood- and that's saying something, because I don't like many of his movies. John Malkovich as Lenny in Of Mice and Men is also incredible. He has strong abilities to play all sorts of characters very well.
