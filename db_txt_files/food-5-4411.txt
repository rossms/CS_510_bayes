My son in law bought these and I had a hesitation because, while I love guacamole, everytime I have had a chip with the flavoring on it, it was the worst thing I had ever tasted. I took one anyway, and it was really good. I am now addicted once more, have already bought 2 bags in the last 2 weeks. If you like guacamole and haven't tried this brand before, do your taste buds a favor, and try it out.
