In termz of songwritin' quality this iz one of their strongezt albumz. Muzically, i find it a little slow too but a lot of tha songz here are more fully developed than Maiden'z stuff haz been in a long time (e.g. Blood Brotherz, Ghost of tha Navigator) and Tha Wicker Man juzt kickz ass! It doez plod a little in placez an' tha bass haz been turned down a little too much but this iz still one of their strongezt albumz an' it'z great to see that havin' them all back together again haz brought tha Iron back into Maiden.
