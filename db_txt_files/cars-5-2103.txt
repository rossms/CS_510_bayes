Since buying a 4 litre V8 Limited GT with all the gubbins as well, I can honestly say that evan now with the new SC430, that it does not have as much as what the SC400 had or has now. It is still ahead of its time now, and faster than quite a few Porsche's and certain Ferrari's and several other makes of supercars.(That is when it is unlimited like mine - it can reach 174mph - no km on my dash).It is the best car I have ever had and gets 11 out of 10 for quality, performance and reliability. The Japs do make a far superior product than the rest of the world (with exceptions to certain British manufacturers)
