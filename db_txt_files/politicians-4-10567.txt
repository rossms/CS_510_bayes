Guess what - George Bush is president and we are under terrorist attack. I can't help noticing that many of you need to get a grip on your childish opinions, overcome your prejudices and join the rest of the nation in banding together against this insanity. If you can't find it somewhere within yourself to do that then, please, when the airports open, purchase a ticket and go someplace where someone is willing to listen to your childish whining. THIS IS NOT THE TIME OR THE PLACE.
