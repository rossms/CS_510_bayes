The local critics gave this 2 stars, saying it didn't have many good laughs. How wrong they are! A great cast: Rowan Atkinson is perfect as as a bumbling Italian, the dynamic duo from Road Trip is back (Breckin Meyer and Amy Smart), and John Cleese does well. And that's only some of the great stuff you'll see in this movie. The directing was very well done, I thought, chronicling the adventures of everyone in their own outrageous and amusing problems, trying to get to the $2 million. An enjoyable film.
