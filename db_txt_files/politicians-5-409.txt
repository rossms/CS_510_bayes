MR Blair quoted something that Winston Churchill said about the U.S. in the past, never distance youself from the Americans. All toehr countries wanted nothing to do with aiding our men in Afghanistan and Iraq. Britain stood by and gave whatever help they could, i DO belive that the war in Afghanistan was 100% justified, and i believe to a certain degree that so was Iraq. Although the main reason for that was to get the oil fields and liberate the Iraqis along the way. But i believe that Tony Blair is a great leader and politician. We wont distance ousrsleves from you Mr Blair.
