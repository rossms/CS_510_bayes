I am now a senior with St. Leo & I don't have any complaints. You never have to be online at any certain time, the amount of work for the most part is not overwhelming, and yet you learn. Because you have to maintain self discipline it causes you to learn more. All tests are open book so that makes it easier. The teachers are very helpful, and the staff is, as well. I would strongly recommend St. Leo
