I was with T-Mobile for a year. I found their service to be ok while you were in one of their service areas, but I paid $150 to get a sleeve to use with my Nokia phone to use it on 800 MHz analong networks. T-Mobile was happy to sell me the sleeve, but neglected to tell me that they had dropped all their roaming agreements with other companies, and that analog service was no longer supported. Needless to say, I dropped them after the year was up.
