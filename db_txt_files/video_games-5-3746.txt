This game had lots of oomph to it when I started, and it seemed as if I was actually doing what I always thought would be fun to do, since it was a fast flowing kind of game. Driver was a real joy that made me feel really alive to touch the controller. But I can't really understand why sometimes it was really hard to play the skirmish options.
