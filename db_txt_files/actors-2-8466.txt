It was pretty ludicrous that she played the same role over and over again, the virtuous woman gallantly striving to preserve her virginity, until she was well in her 40s. A third-rate Big Band singer who was physically hot way back in the day, but became rather matronly in the mid-1950s. Pillow Talk, I must admit, is a pretty funny film, and she does put in a good performance, but that role was well-honed because she had done it before.
