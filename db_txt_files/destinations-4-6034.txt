My aunt lives right outside of Phoenix and I've been to visit her twice. Both times I went, it was spring, so the weather was pleasant, not scorching hot yet. I love the scenery and the wide selection for places to eat, shopping, and pretty much anything else. I don't think I could ever live there. Too big for me. I also wasn't impressed by the driving there. I would love to go and visit again though.
