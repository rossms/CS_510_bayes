I can appreciate the endeavour of this book, and I'm not being deliberately contrary, but I hated Ulysses. And admittedly it's one of those novels on the greatest novels lists some people say is a masterpiece without reading it, just to sound profound. Too each his own, but James Joyce is not my choice writer. I'd like to be able to read one page without needing the footnotes!
