I love the Express' dressier clothes. The dresses and skirts are chic and colorful, but not trashy if you get the right size and the style to fit your body type. The clothes are glam enough to suit my taste, although a little bit on the expensive side. If you want something great from Express, go to the clearance racks!!!
