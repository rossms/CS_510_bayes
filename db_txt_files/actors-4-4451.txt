Lately I've been watching the first few seasons of the X files, and I have to say, he was absolutely horrible, his acting that is.. I can't believe he even got the job. With the years he got better, a lot better, so I'll give him that. He's still not an incredible actor, but he is obviously intelligent, and talented.
