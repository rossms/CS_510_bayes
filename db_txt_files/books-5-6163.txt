I found this book to be very informative, and quite scary. What goes on behind closed doors with our Presidents is many times frightening. Eisenhower with the U2 lies, plans to attack americans making it appear to be Cuban sponsored..with plans to do major harm to Castro and cubans, to Johnson and the USS Liberty coverup, lies protecting Israel and putting American troops under severe 'hush' controls to Carter's final agreement with Israel for financial renumeration for the USS Liberty. It makes you feel like you can trust no one, and believe very little what you're told or hear.
