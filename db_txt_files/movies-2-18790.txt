It would have been nice to know who or what made the tape. If the family horse ranch was on an island then why was the girl's body dumped into a well on the mainland? When you see this scene you see horses in the background. Which implies that they were at a horse ranch. Were they at a friend's horse ranch? Did they own a second one? Other than these little questions I thought it was funny to watch people freak out at various scenes. The movie wasn't scary at all but it was funny.
