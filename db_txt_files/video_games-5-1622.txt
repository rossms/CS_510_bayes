This game is basically the PSone's Metal Gear Solid storyline mixed with the PS2's MGS2 gameplay. The controls can take a while to get used to if you're used to playing the PlayStation versions, but after you get the hang of it it's all good. It's not a very long game, nor is it very hard, but it's a lot of fun. If you are a fan of the Metal Gear series, then this is at least a Solid rental for you. Really no need to buy it if you have MGS on the PS1. All in all though, it's a fun game.
