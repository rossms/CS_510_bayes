I am a 1987 graduate of Cornell and I cherish the education I earned at Cornell. It is absolutely a disgrace for anyone to make negative comments about Cornell especially when they didn't go to Cornell. Indeed, in academia there are no perfect places. However, there are places that hand out easy grades, and degrees. Cornell is not one of them. Cornell will not let you down academically! You will work for the degree that you intend to take. I have since gone on to earn my Ph.D. at a very famous British university. Cornell prepared me well for what I encountered in Britain.
