As a director he was great. The Invisable Man, Frankenstien ...all have that undefinable quality that makes them intreguing and memorable. By the way, if you have not seen that movie about him, Of Gods And Monsters, I recommend that you don't! It's terrible. If you do, just remember I warned you. ...well, we warned you!
