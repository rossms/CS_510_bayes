Bobby Cox beat my wife!!! Every time I see that pile of piss do an interview I want to reach through the TV and murder him. He should sell his ONE series ring and buy himself a friggin' clue. The only record Cox will ever set is most ejections for arguing ump's calls, a true sign of a retarded manager since arguing a call has NEVER, in the history of MLB, helped a team win, but getting yourself kicked out has certainly helped team's lose.
