My business friend refered me to the Nokia 5100 series. They said they had good luck with the one they had purchased, so I decided to get one. I had no problems with the Nokia 5100 series after I learned how to use it. The billing answers were great through customer service, and I will recommend the Nokia 5100 to others.
