The Omen is a very good horror flick. Somewhat dated, it can still be enjoyed today. Definitely considered a very dark film. The haunting organ music throughout is extremely enjoyable, and the acting is good. Gregory Peck and Lee Remick star. If you are into dark horror films, this is a must see. Though clean by todays standards, I would still recommend caution about letting younger viewers watch it.
