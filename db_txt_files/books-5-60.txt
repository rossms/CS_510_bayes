This book is more important for what it is than how well it is written. As to the latter, it is written about as well as you would expect, considering the author is an adolescent, living in fear that she barely understands while dealing with the trauma of turning into an adult. If you read it expecting good writing, you will be disappointed. If you read it for an understanding of what it means in a historical perspective, you will be entranced. Chilled, but entranced.
