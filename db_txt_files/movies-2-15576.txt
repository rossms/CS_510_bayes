Complete cookie cutter story of the boy meets girl, fish out of water, Romeo and Juliet, Hollywood fluff film where they cast the best looking actors possible in order to make money. The only redeeming part of this movie is when the ship sank. It was entertaining to see the passengers fall overboard. Good special effects.
