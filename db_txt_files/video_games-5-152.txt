This game is simply more Doom. More of a good thing. And the new levels, monsters, weapon, skies, music, and textures don't hurt the experience any. If you like Doom, then pick this up wherever you can. I'm sure there is a free copy of it somewhere on the 'net. I wish they still made games like this.
