I went to Oahu during my spring break, and it was fantastic!!!! Going to the rain forest and touring out the whole island was the best part. Please, get out of Waikiki Beach, too many tourist. Go to Sunset Beach to see some good looking men surfing. But remember, Sunset Beach is not for swimming....no way!!!
