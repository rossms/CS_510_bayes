Damn! Derek is the best ss in ny and everyone knows it. He is a great player and not to mention he's beautiful!I think he should have been #1 batchalor not #2. I would do anything to meet him. I am his biggest fan ever and all the people that like him kick ass. All of the haters that dont are just jelious.
