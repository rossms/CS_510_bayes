My husband just got me a HUGE diamond ring for WHOLESALE price at Whitehall in Santa Monica. It's a 1 ct princess cut with another 2.25 cts diamond sidestones. It retailed for over 18K, but he got it (with warranty) for under $6,500! I just had it independently appraised --VS1, G color, no floresence. Replacement value through insurance company -- $8,500. The appraiser was really impressed with the deal my husband got. I've only been in the Whitehall store once, but everyone was very friendly. No complaints here!
