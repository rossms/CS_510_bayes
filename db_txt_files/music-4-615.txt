A couple of years ago, I lost this CD in my closet and that made me mad. I never bought the album again, which is fine since I found it again anyway, but I love Alanis's lyrics: everything from man-hating to the harsh realities of trying to be perfect to the confessions of true love. I can identify with her tunes, and that is great too,
