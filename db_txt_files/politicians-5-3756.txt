I feel that George W. has been a real asset to our state as governor and cannot wait to see him in the White House. He is a man of integrity and yes he has made mistakes in his life, but I cannot see that he has lied to our faces like Al Gore has. I support his reform ideas on Social Security and tax cuts and this will benefit everyone if given a chance
