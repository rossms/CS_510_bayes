Drool drool slobber. Now I want to go there... too bad I'd have to drive for two hours. This chain is the ONLY chain that I know of that truly preserves the Chicago style deep dish pizza. Uno's is wonderful and I'm almost glad we don't have one locally in Tampa, since I'd spend entirely too much time there.
