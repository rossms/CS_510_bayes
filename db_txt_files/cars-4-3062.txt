Rented a 3.8 liter supercharged 4 door last fall for a week while in South Carolina. It was very comfortable to sit in and the engine sound was very exhilerating under acceleration. It gave me the impression of having a space ship cockpit. Looks: 4, Performance: 5, Comfort: 5(Front seat) Handling: 3. Note: for having four wheel disks it was a disappointment in stopping power. Typical American mediocrity toward consumer marketing versus pure performance. I might buy one if it only had two doors (Coupe). As it is, I will stick with my Focus SVT.
