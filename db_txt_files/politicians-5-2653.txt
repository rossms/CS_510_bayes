I am so disappointed that he was not in the race. I was so impressed to see that someone finally was using good logic and listened to the people about the issues that really affect our everyday life. To bad that more politicians do not have the guts to stand up and say what they really think instead of saying what they think we want to hear. I am the type of person that I want the truth no matter how bad it is. Because then I can make decisions based on facts not on white lies. He was just that sort of man. I hope that he runs again.
