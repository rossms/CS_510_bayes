Strange cigarette. So smooth, so lite, so easy on your throat, your first reaction is these thing must be super duper ultra lights . . then the buzz hits . . WoW . . . they don't have the full flavor of the Turkish Royals I like, but they have a real kick and are the closest thing to what one would dream of in a cigarette . . except the flavor is a little thin.
