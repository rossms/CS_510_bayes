There was a Long John Silver's in my work area. It was a favorite stopping place. For fast food it was the best and reasonably price too. We waited years for one to open in our area. We are still waiting. Thank heavens that the KFC 20 miles from us has wisely incorporated a Long John Silver,s menu.l
