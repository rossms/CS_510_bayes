Lancaster is a nice touristy place in PA... the outlets are awesome if you have money to spend. Hershey Park is beautiful during Christmas time... You cannot leave PA without buying apple cider donuts and visiting the pretzel factory... I've stayed with my friend in Doylestown but it isn't too exciting there... and some parts of Philly are VERY sketchy... I definitely reccomend the safer and more known parts of PA.
