Not really a very good beer. I grew up in Pennsylvania and remember it as the cheap beer that it was - not the trendy, green-bottle driven, 33 beer that it is. I remember being a little shocked seeing people in swanky Miami bars drinking this swill. The power of marketing will never cease to amaze me.
