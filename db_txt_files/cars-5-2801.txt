The rotary engine hasn't had as much time to be engineered when compared with the piston engine. The rotary has only been in existence for 30 - 40 years. Given time, money, and most importantly, competition from other companies, i'm sure it can be a better engine than the piston. Of course, it's not looking hopeful that some other companies join the rotary race again.
