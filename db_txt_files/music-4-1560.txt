I love Nirvana. I think they are one of the greatest bands in history and if they wouldn't have come along then we wouldn't have alot of great bands that we have now. Except for that gay ass puddle of mudd. If you look at the tabs for smells like teen spirit and the tabs for she hates me, they are exactly the same except played a different number of times. They ripped them off!!
