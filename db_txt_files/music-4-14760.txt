I used to really love this CD. Eventually I got bored with it, mainly because the songs were overplayed in radios all across the country. Actually, the songs are wonderful. Sissel's background vocal for most of the songs gives the songs the dreamy and haunting feelings. I still have a hard time chewing Celine Dion's song even after 1.5 years, if I'm not mistaken, of not listening to it. Overall, this CD is great!
