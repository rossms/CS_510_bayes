I've followed him throughout his career, from his rookie year to his unfortunate departure, and there aren't words to describe him. He was/is a freak of nature. I've never seen a RB make so many defenders look so foolish. It was a workout just to TRY to tackle him. The greatest player of the modern era. (My modern era begins at 1990 =) If Barry didn't prematurely retire, we would not be talking about Emmitt as the all-time leading rusher, since Sanders would have taken that title a couple years earlier.
