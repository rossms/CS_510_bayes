My G35 coupe has been everything I had hoped it to be. There are minor problems but that's to be expected. It is THE perfect car for me and I've been just loving it! Last weekend I slid off a mountain road, over an embankment and into the trees after hitting ice on a curve. My G35 took every bit of damage and I walked away totally unscathed. Safetywise as well, I couldn't recommend this car more. If mine is totalled by the insurance company, I'm without a doubt going to be back in line to order another.
