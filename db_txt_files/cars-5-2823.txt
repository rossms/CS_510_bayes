With the exception of tuned Mustangs such as those offered by Roush, Saleen, and Steeda, I'm really not wild about the newer models. But being in a family that at one time owned not one, but two Shelby GT500 fastbacks (dad had a '69 and my grandfather had a '68 KR), I will say that the Mustang is the quintessential muscle car.
