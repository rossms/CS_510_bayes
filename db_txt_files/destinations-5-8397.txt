Almost every high school in South Florida comes to visit the Holocaust Memorial in Miami Beach. It's quite an experience, especially when you have a Holocaust surviver explain the meaning the site has to him. The sculpture at the front of the memorial is very hauting, it's a remembrance to all of us that we cannot allow tyranny to reign surpreme.
