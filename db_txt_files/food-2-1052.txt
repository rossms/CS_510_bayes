I just can't stand the fact that you would add in pecans to a cereal, because it makes it taste so strange and nutty, that it seems more like a trail mix then a cereal. If you can take pecans, almonds, peanuts, and coconuts in your cereal, then Great Grains is your dream, but if not stay away from at all costs.
