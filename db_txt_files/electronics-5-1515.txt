If you like bass, get Cerwin Vega speakers. If you don't like bass, get something else. I've had these speakers for 8 years, and they still kick out the bass (and sound pretty good as well). I have never had any problems with them, and I have never been in a situation which they couldn't handle the power of my Denon receiver. Great speakers.
