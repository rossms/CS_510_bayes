It is wonderful to drive. The acceleration of the V6 is great and the cornering is not much more difficult than in my camry. I even parked my HL on city street without a problem. I loved my camry but I needed a vehicle to take to my daughter's horse shows and I don't like trucks. The HL does everything I need goes through the paddocks and fields and provides a comfortable ride for my everyday commute! My only complaint is the clicking noise around the sunroof. I like not having the center console as it is a great place for my briefcase or purse and the kids can move back and forth easily. Love this vehicle.
