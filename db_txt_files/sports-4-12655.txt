The Texas Longhorns, I believe, are now on the cusp of greatness. Their recruiting, thanks to Mack Brown, has been phenomenal the last few years. But now, I think it's time to put up or shut up. The 'Horns MUST learn how to beat the big boys on their schedule (namely Oklahoma), and prove that they're for real. I'll be pulling hard for them. For now, though, until they prove themselves capable of winning big with their top-tier personnel, I'm rating this team a 4 .
