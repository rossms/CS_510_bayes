I think what snyder has done is remarkable. Kansas state does not get any top players. They build diamonds from coal. Kansas State has become a power house which wins on a constant basis. The NC schedule is bad but it will be same for most schools soon as no one would would want a loss. They should havev been in the championship game in 98. I don't think he is the best coach in football but he certainly ranks among the top tier of coaches. It is unfair in my mind not to bestow greatness on a coach if he has not won a championship. 4 stars in my mind ..may be 4.25
