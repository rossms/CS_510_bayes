You cannot beat the weather in California- especially along the coast.Outdoors there is more to do then you can imagine. Great beaches, mountains, deserts, forests, skiing, great cities (Including San Fran) The most beautiful city in North America, and of course there is Tinsletown, etc etc. Incredible. However there is too much traffic in the urban areas, a sort of shallow culture, and high costs throughout most of the state- which make the quality of life questionable.
