Within its genre, it is a classic. One of my favorite films as a kid. The Creature or Gill Man is an incredibly sympathetic character that reresents the outsider who is, in many ways a physically challenged human being. He is pittied rather than loved by those around him. But not by those who enjoy the movie.
