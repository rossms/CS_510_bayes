I love Nancy Lee Grahn, and Alexis Davis. They both have so much beauty and class. Nancy Lee Grahn is my favorite actress right after Robin Christopher! I am sorry, but I have to totally disagree with you there, PinkLady3! I love them to pieces, and if you don't then you need to go right on down to the mental hospital. (I am serious people.)
