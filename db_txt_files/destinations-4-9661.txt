Good cigarette.. Nice taste- has that full camel taste too it, reminds me of coconuts for some reason. goes down smooth. strong- it is the strongest cig that i smoked so far. burns pretty fast, so when I need that quick nicotene fix, this is what i choose. overall its a good cigarette that I will buy again
