Okay, so last season Coker proved he could help the team avoid internal conflicts and could coach a team that was clearly the nation's most talented to the national championship. Now comes the fun part. Larry Coker's 2002 mission is to take a raw yet talented team to the promised land when ever other team in the country is gunning for them. As long as Ken Dorsey is there, Miami will have a chance, but the schedule looks brutal. Last year's title was enough for 4 stars, but this year we'll see exactly how good a head coach Coker actually is.
