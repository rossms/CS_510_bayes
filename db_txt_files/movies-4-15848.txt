Magnolia was a good movie. I thought it was not as tightly woven as Boogie Nights . I loved William H. Macy, as usual, and the child actor was wonderful. The girl who played the drug addict was also very good, as was the guy who played the policeman. Did anyone understand what the little kid rapper was rapping about? P.S. I saw William H. Macy in person last night at the Mill Valley Film Festival!
