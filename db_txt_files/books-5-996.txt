From what I can remember about them (I have not read them in eight or so years), they were funny and entertaining to read, and Mrs. Piggle Wiggle always was an interesting character to me. I wouldn't suggest real parents take Mrs. Piggle Wiggle's advice for dealing with certain problems, LOL, BUT the scenarios that she created always made for an entertaining read.
