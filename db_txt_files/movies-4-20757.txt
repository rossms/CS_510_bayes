If you're in the mood for a strange movie, then Rocky Horror Picture should be at the top of your list. Now a sucessful broadway play, Rocky Horror is about a newly married couple's car that breaks down, and they take shelter at a haunted house off the road. There they meet Dr. Frankenfurter who holds them captured with a bunch of weirdos called TRansylvanians. Some great dance numbers.
