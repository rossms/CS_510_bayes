Pure lush. This car makes my mouth water. Not a screaming look at me! type sportscar but a delicious classy one. Apparently it shifts beautifully, sounds like a dream and goes up to 190mph. Nice. If I had 400,000 dollars in my hot little hand right now, I'd line up and buy a Vanquish right now. I just recently saw one up close at a car show. WOW. U n b e l i e v a b l e.
