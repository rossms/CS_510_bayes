The stores I've been in have been organized, well kept, and usually have quiet spots to sit and read. Nice selection of printed and recorded media, though I've had to look elsewhere (usually Amazon) for titles that they did not have-and their DVDs and CDs are way overpriced. But you will usually find what you are looking for at B & N.
