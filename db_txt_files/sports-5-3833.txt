Hands down the most dominant baseball player ever to walk on the diamond I could go all day bout this guy. back to back greatest offensive number seasons in history all while getting walked 195 times. Best post season numbers EVER. 5 MVP's when theres nobody that has won more than 3 If more people would vote now he would be and should be #1. People that know baseball know there isn't any better out there
