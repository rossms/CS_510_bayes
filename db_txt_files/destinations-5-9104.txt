It is one of the most beautiful sites I have ever seen in the world. You have to go to the officila site of Pakistan govt (pak.gov.pk) to know what I mean. Having lived in Pakistan for so many years I had heard of the beauty of these valleys but had not actually seen them. But now that I have seen them, I want to go back and live the rest of my life there. It is really paradise on earth.
