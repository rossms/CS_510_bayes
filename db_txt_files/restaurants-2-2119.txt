I don't know if anyone has ever had a bad experince at a Tim Horton's drivethrough. But I did. I work 2 jobs so I stop at. The Tim Horton's in Wingham Ont,It was at night on my way home. And when I stopped that night The girl that took my oder made it but insted of staing at the window and giving it to me. She left to go and talk to some of her friends that were at the counter.I sat there for 5min. waiting for one cup of coffee. And then the young lad that came to the window after that thought that I was there for a sandwitch that the car behind me had odered.
