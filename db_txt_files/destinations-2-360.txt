Vancouver is absolutely stunning - when the weather is good! I lived there for 12 months, and for 10 of those months, it was grey and drizzled rain and you couldn't see the mountains. If you go for a holiday, it is essential that you go when the weather is at it's best. Otherwise you'll be very disappointed.
