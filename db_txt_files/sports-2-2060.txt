This will probably be the toughest season for the Diamondbacks in quite some time. Luis Gonzales shoulder is still giving him some problems. Obviously this will hinder his throwing arm and may cut back on his power by 5-10 homeruns. Also, it is unlikely Randy Johnson will maintain his level of excellence at his age, though he will still baffle most hitters. Another factor is the loss of Curt Schilling who not only is one of the premeir pitchers, but also a good leader in the dugout and seems to motivate his fellow teammates
