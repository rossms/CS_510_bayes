This Book deserves more stars than this page has to offer... this book has been compared to lord of the rings in its greatness, however i believe that it deserves far more accolades than this comparison and the Hugo and Nebula awards that it won. anyone who thinks otherwise either didnt get it (Read it again) or hasnt got it (get it). simply put, this book is a must.
