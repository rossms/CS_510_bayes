if you want to play a more innocent game (ok, seriosly, these games we play, blating people apart, chopping limbs off, you have to agree with me) the sims is for you. Through getting a job to going to the bathroom, this game is for you. There id NO flaw in this game whatsoever (well ok, sometimes) but nothing major, the worse ive had is our old computer crashed, our VERY OLD computer. Anywho, Working to get promotions, slapping other sims, takes up a lot of time on your day and turns it into fun well-wasted
