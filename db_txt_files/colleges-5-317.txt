This must be a 5 star university. If I will go to UK to study, I would definitely choose to go to Heriot-Watt University. The campus is great plus the prestige of the name they posses. I love to be among their highly qualified graduates who enjoy high paying jobs and all. Herriot-Watt University is for me the best university in Scotland and among the best in Europe. I have heard their MBA is among the most presitigious in the world. Congrats to Heriot-Watt U and more power to their staff!!!
