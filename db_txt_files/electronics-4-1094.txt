I've had it for over a year now. Works great and is very easy to use as a phone. Also easier to use as a PDA than your typical Palm (the key is the mini-keyboard, which definitely beats using Graffiti to enter characters). Palm and PDA functions are well-integrated. Only negative is that it's still bulkier than most cell phones, so it's a pain to take places where you don't need a PDA (like when meeting friends for dinner). At least this is the smallest of the PDA/phone combos.
