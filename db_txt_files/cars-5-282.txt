quick; responsive; clean shifting; comfortable. Mine is outfitted with a triple chainring as I do some hilly roads in San Marino. I had always wanted one. When they were discontinued, the price dropped, and I had one built. Wow! like night and day compared to my previous road bike. It simply wants to go faster.
