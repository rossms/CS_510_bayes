One of the strongest right handed hitters I've ever seen. I saw him break his bat checking his swing, and it wasn't a fluke, I saw it twice three seasons apart. He hit liners off the Monster that would bounce back almost to second. Never fast, as he got older he got slower, and became the tail out on a lot of double plays. Adequate if unspectacular in the field.
