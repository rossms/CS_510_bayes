Congratulations to West Virginia on a big bowl win tonight against Georgia. Rodriguez's coaching had a big influence on that, especially with his call for a fake punt with 2 minutes left in the game. West Virginia isn't a state with a lot of homegrown talent, so Rodriguez has had to recruit in a lot more places than other coaches. He has done a good job of brining in players to Morgantown, and has one a decent amount of games every year.
