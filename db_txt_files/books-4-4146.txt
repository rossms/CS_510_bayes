This book dives very deep into the mind of a disturbed man. Yet, he expresses himself so articulately that the reader can understand him and even empathize with him. The fact that Nabakov can put the reader into the mind of a pedophile is an amazing(and sick) feat. Humbert sees a good reason to justify everyone of his actions and he creates his own destruction, while he feels no remorse.
