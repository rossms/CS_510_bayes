I caught a game at Wrigley a couple of years ago when I was driving across the country. I could not believe how much personality this place had...First of all it is small, I don't think it holds much more than 35,000 fans - this really adds a festive, private party kind of feel to the experience. Second, it is located in a fun part of town - you leave the stadium after the game, and there are all kinds of bars to check out. Finally, EVERYBODY is drunk. This makes for a carnival, boisterous atmosphere... Definitely a good time...
