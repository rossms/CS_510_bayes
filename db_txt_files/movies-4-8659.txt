This is a really good, bordering on great movie. The world knows that DeNiro is a great actor, but he is usually remembered for his roles in Godfather II, Good Fellas, Raging Bull, and others. In Midnight Run, he really showed his great versatility and tremendous comedic range. He and Charles Grodin are both wonderful. Given that they have only teamed up for this picture, their chemistry is impressive. I definitely recommend this movie.
