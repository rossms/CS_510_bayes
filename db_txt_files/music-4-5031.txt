I have mixed feelings about this CD, and I think the rating really depends on the persons point of view. Although I really like the music on this CD, and there is A LOT of variety, I don't think it really conforms to real country music. It's extremely off beat, espeically Good-bye Earl, about spousal abuse and murder, something rarely heard of in country music, however, too much conformity gets dull, and I highly recommend this CD.
