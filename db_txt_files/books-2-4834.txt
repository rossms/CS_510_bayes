Like The Odyssey, it has impossible character names. However, it definitely lacks the universal themes that were scattered all throughout The Odyssey. The book is about the Trojan War for people that are very familiar with that era and the events that happened during that unique epoch in history. I definitely would not recommend it as much as The Odyssey.
