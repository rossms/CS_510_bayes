It's not a surprise that AC/DC's most successful albums have been with producer Mutt Langue at the helm. However, groups with catchy hooks are up Mutt's alley (Foreigner, Def LEppard, etc.). Every single song is exactly that: catchy and also great. The band just piles on the rock hits on this album (title track, Girls Got Rythum, and Walk All Over You. ).
