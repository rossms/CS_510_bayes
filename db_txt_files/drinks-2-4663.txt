More like coca-sugar! The taste is to syrupy, I don't think it should be called cola. Sure it's been around for a long time, maybe the taste was better when it first came out or when it was served in glass bottles. I'm not sure what it is but coca-sugar isn't that great. One thing I can say for coke is the commercials aren't as repulsive as the ones for pepsi. C'mon, they need Britney Spears to sell the product? Can you say Desperate?!
