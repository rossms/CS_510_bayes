A total pretend-to-be-import ripoff. Take a generic supermarket beer (in this case Coor's I guess) add some red food coloring, give it an Irish sounding name (let's call it Killian's so that people might confuse it with the real Irish beer Kilkenny). Voila, you have the perfect beer for the wannabe high-brow redneck. Ignorance is bliss.
