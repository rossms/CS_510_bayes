London is great anytime, but it's best to go during the summer. That being said, London is a party city year round! It starts to get warmer in April, doesn't rain nearly as much as people think (and only briefly when it does rain). It is overcast most of the time in winter/spring however, and isn't warm enough to lay out in the spring. But- the pubs are awesome, the clubs are hot...London is the most fun place I've ever been!! You can NEVER be bored in London.
