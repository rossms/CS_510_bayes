The rich chewy blueberries and sweet flakes and clusters make this cereal a step above the rest. It's really in a class on its own as far as cereals go. My only complaint is that you really can't enjoy a whole lot of it at a time before it gets to be a little too rich. Other than that, it's fantastic stuff.
