Not very many worthwile games and a very big dead pixel problem. Honestly, who wants to buy a brand new product $200+ and have the display be defective? As for the games there have been a few that looked good when they were announced but they scored very low ratings in reviews. You also have to buy very expensive memory cards. Not worth it if you ask me.
