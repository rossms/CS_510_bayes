 Let's go Europe is outstanding. I used it in Leon and Paris and it never let me down. Everything was up to date and the information was accurate. Its extensive lists of hostels were extrememly useful. Local attractions were mapped and metro directions were given. Let's go Europe left nothing out. I purchased this guide in particular because of high recommendations from friends and even the Education Abroad Dept. at Cal, Berkeley.
