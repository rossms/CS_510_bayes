I love Bill Cowher as he is a tough and hard-nosed style coach .. However, I just don't think he is getting it done with the Steelers. Ifhe doesn't get the job done this year then it may be time he and the Steelers move on and go in separate directions. Which is unfortunate, but Steelers have been underachieving for too long.
