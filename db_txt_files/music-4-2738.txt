A pretty amazing record -- especially when you consider George Martin produced the whole thing on four tracks... total genius. But it's not without filler ( Mr Kite , George Harrison's indulgent sitar thing, etc) -- still, A Day in the Life is great as are a host of others here ( Lovely Rita is a forgotten classic).
