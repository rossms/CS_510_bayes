Chilis originally introduced me to Fajitas many years ago and I still like theirs better than just about anyone else's. They have a number of other wonderful dishes too, and the value is good. Service is usually excellent (although I have been to one or two here and there that were mediocre at best) and they are worth visiting for reliably good results. Not a good choice on weekends - waiting for 45-60 minutes for any chain restaurant's food is stupid!
