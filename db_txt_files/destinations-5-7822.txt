This is my absolute favorite place to go in Chicago. I love how disperse the paintings are...anything from ancient chinese and indian to french impressionism. I can spend hours and hours here. The only annoying thing is the museum has allowed people to photograph the paintings which does get annoying. Take the tour with the head set, and if you are going to park, park in the Monroe Street Garage right across the street. If you park before 9am it is cheaper. Tuesdays at the museum are free.
