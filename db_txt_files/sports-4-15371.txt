The best he is not. He is a very good QB and yet again, has not won the big game. He had plenty of opportunities to bring his team back at home vs the Steelers and he failed and looked very frustrated. Manning is an excellent fantasy QB but is not the QB to have in the clutch. The comparisons between Manning and Brady need to stop once and for all.
