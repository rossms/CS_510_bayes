Bush needs to relax,Don't use prewritten jokes, be natural,he has a good sense of humor. Also when given an oppurtunity to nail Gore to the wall like he was given at the debate,don't hold back, remind America he said Clinton was The best President we've ever had And also remind the people he never once commented on Clintons disgusting behavior,next time nail him. Please
