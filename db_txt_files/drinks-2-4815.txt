I don't know about other people, but Dr. Pepper sure doesn't make my world taste better. The greatest thing I've ever known Dr. Pepper to do is make my belly feel better when I had a bad ache, simply because it gave me a serious case of belching. I wouldn't lay my hands on this carbonated prune juice unless it was the only thing left next to diet anything or Pepsi.
