Friendly's quality has seemed to dwindle over the past few years, but not because of their food. Their food is still good (especially Mozzeralla sticks and chicken strips), and their ice cream is great as well. However, service is what this restraunt lacks. Hire more qualified and attentive servers! UPDATE: The quality of this place countines to go downhill. They've jacked the prices up and the food is barely edible. Considering that this used to be one of my favorite places to go as a kid, it's quite a shame.
