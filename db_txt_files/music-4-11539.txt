this was a good album i do have to admit and offspring is the best band in the world, but this is the ablum where they really differe from smash or ignition more kinda funk,rock, punk, before they were hard rock punk which i personally liked better, but i do have to say this album did have some good songs like pretty fly, have ever, which i have to say was a awesome song espcially the ending, kids aren't alright,americana, but i do have to say they kinda ruined pay the man, they shuld have taken the first 5 minutes out of that song, if u like punk/rock music get this album
