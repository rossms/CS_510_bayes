A fairly good, uplifting and sometimes funny movie from Disney. This movie shows that racism can be overcome and that teamwork means victory in the end. Barely any profanity, only mild violence and no sexual innuendo are in this film that can be enjoyed by everyone. And, also Densel Washington is great as the new coach.
