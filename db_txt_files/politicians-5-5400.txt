All you radical religious nuts, rabid republicans, and fat-cat billionaires - ain't nothing gonna keep Al Gore from becoming the next president of the USA!!! It's already happening - the slow disentigration of the 'George Dubbya' dog and pony show, with it's smoke and mirrors and holier than thou, smug attitudes. Al Gore will become one of the greatest presidents this nation has ever seen. He cares about the middle class and the environment. He has a definite plan for the future of our great nation. Vote Gore/Lieberman in 2000!!!
