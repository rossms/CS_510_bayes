People doubted Dr. Dre but his 2001 CD proves them all wrong. The beats on this CD are all hella crazy-maybe the best ever in an album. Ummm....the songs on here aren't spectacular but what I really like about it is there are a lot of songs/almost all of them that feature some other artists, for example, Eminem, Snoop Dogs, etc.
