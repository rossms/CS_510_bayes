This store has some great products, but I gave it a BAD rating because the quality control is so poor. I've shopped at several Trader Joe locations on the east coast, and every time I get at least one item that, when opened, is moldy. Stay away from the refrigerated items in particular (burritos, fresh pasta), which are often bad before their experiation date.
