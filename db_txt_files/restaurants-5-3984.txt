Cheesecake Factory offers really good food with big portions. In fact, I almost never finish my meals off there, I just take it home. The main entrees and apetizers themselves are very good and fresh. The great part about this restaurant is that it suits everyone's tastes. They have Chinese food, seafood, and Italian all on the same menu among other things. Of course, the desserts are some of the best around. Any of the cheesecakes are great, but my personal favorite dessert at the Cheesecake Factory is the strawberry shortcake.
