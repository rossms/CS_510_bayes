Though he is now considered by many to be a horror film star, that is really not an accurate description of Lon Chaney. If you think about it, he seldom played any kind of monster. Most of the roles he played - including his most famous ones - were portraying unfortunate, tormented human beings. And he did a great job of it too. Not only was he a great actor but he was an artist. He did his own makeup. He practically created the characters he played all by himself. He's one of the best and most unique film stars of the silent era.
