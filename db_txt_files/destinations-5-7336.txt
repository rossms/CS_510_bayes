Interesting medieval town in the middle of the La Mancha region of Spain. I have one piece of advice though; don't go during the summer, it's BLAZING HOT THERE! Otherwise, go and see the Parador (Spanish country inn), the views of Toledo are great from the terrace of the restaurant. It is said that El Greco painted his View of Toledo portrait from that spot.
