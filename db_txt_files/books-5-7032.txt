The only science fiction writer I have ever been able to get into. I read this novel in 9th grade and my belief in life on other planets grew deeper thanks to Ray. I had the pleasure of meeting him at a book signing a couple of years ago. How often do you get to chat with an author that you admire? He was so humble and kind. I told him how this book enlightened me to the possibilities of life on other planets.
