This game has a lot of good points. The gameplay has been enhanced, the graphics have been enhanced, the enemy AI is much better, and it is much more realistic. The only gripes I had about it was that i had to play most of the game as Raiden, not Snake. That and the storyline could have been better. Other than that this game is great. LOTS of replay value.
