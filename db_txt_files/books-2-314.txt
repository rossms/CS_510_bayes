Try putting this under the fiction section. I am not a huge fan of the Clintons; as a matter of fact I've never been a fan. I got this as a gift recently and I did read it. Hillary's memoirs are devoid of anything interesting or enlightening. As usual, she passes the blame for all of her indiscretions on her political opponents rather than looking at her own dishonest ways. However, she has managed to stay out of trouble in the Senate. But Hillary still plays the role of victim and she demonstrates this in her book.
