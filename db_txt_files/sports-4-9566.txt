Here's to the Admiral. If my Mavs or Kings can't win, then win the title for David Robinson. Not only is he one of the classiest players in the NBA, but he also shares my birthday and the day the first atomic bomb was dropped on Hiroshima - not that any of that matters. Duncan will sorely miss Robinson next season, but he will take the helm of the Spurs and do a good job.
