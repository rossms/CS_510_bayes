I love my Highlander Hybrid Limited! Around 26 MPG average on long highway trips (at average speeds of 70+ MPH with AC on). Close to 30 MPG in city driving. Balls to the wall acceleration (0 to 60 in around 7 seconds). It rocks! But open the rear windows on the highway and you get a loud thumping throb (wind noise) that seems like it will burst your eardrums. So what do I do? Keep the rear windows closed in my brand new $42,000 SUV??? Maybe I'll try those rainguards and see if it makes a difference. Otherwise, no real complaints. I highly recommend it.
