She's intelligent. I'll give her that. Don't get me wrong. I'm as liberal democrat as they come, but I don't believe in making Hillary a role model for young girls. For one thing, She allows her husband to cheat on her multiple times with such trollops as Monica Lewinsky, Gennifer Flowers, and Paula Jones. Seccond, She supported a terrorist organization. (Panthers are no better than the KKK.) Third, She has some totalitarian policies. Although I do respect her as an orator.
