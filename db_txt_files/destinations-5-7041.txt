London's captured my heart -- I'm hoping to return for a full 6 weeks next year, my third visit... The different cultures, the history, the old world beauty -- an enormous village (I'm rhapsodizing a bit, but not by much). One of my favorite attractions was actually just outside of London: Hampton Court Palace -- Breathtaking, and not to be missed!
