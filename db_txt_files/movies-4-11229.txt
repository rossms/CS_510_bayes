This movie was good it was not as good as the first one but it still has some cute scenes. Now in this movie Scott has to find a wife or else he will no tbe able to be Santa anymore so in order to go down an dfind a wife they have to have someone do his job so they make a santa duplicate who ends up making a mess of things. While he is looking for a wife he can only use so much magic and once he uses all of it up he will not be able to return back to the North Pole. This was cute not bad for a sequel.
