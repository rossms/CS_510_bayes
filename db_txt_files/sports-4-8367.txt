Already has made a name for himself. The playoffs this year was incredible. I find it unbelievble that vangundy took him out of the game the last seconds of the game when NOONE else was making shots. He was looking like Kobe when he got 42 against the Spurs. If he can get a big post man to take some pressure off him, it would make for a devastating combo with wade and odom. 2-3 years and the heat could be top contendors in the east.
