Hey, I've been an 's fan my entire life. Sure, they've been lousy the past five years but, I still support my team. I love to watch them play. Yeah, winning is much better than losing. Losing is part of the game. The Orioles had their dynasty in the 70's and 80's and they are rebuilding. They finally made changes internally to change this year. I know the players will do well, GO O'S!!!!!
