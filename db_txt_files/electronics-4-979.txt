The digital Startac has one of the best receptions. Also, its design was tested by 60 minutes, and showed to have one of the lowest absorbtion rates of the wave signals produced by cell phones. Overall a great phone. The flip design protects the screen and buttons from damage. The only downfall is the short battery life.
