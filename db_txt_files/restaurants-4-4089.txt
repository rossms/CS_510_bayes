The one here in Plano, my husband and I went for our anniversary first year in Texas, and for a chain place, it was pretty good. The waitresses were fun, they started dancing country, which was an amusing form of entertainment. I don't like how they have the store with all this Joe crab shack crap for unreasonable prices. My motto is, if I am going to advertise for you, you better give me the t-shirt for free. Had my first crayfish there, and enjoyed myself. Not a bad price, either.
