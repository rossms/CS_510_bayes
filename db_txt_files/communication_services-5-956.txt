I have had a wireless phone for nearly 12 years and have tried service with virtually every provider there is(even some who no longer exist), and I have never had better coverage or customer service than with AT&T Wireless Services. I travel all across the US and have experienced very few gaps in their coverage. Sure, some other companies are marginally better on pricing, but you get what you pay for.
