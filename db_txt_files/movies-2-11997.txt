Julia Stiles shines in this film (as always), but the film stinks on ice. The storyline is confusing, and hard to follow the entire time. It's basically about a guy stuck between two girls, one of whom is totally annoying and leaves things behind such as panties and bras that make the real girlfriend suspicious. When the two girls clash there is no spark, and it seems as though they're now turning against him. He does a bunch of stupid small stunts that make no sense. The screenplay fails to deliver anything, and Stiles could've done another film, despite her great presence here.
