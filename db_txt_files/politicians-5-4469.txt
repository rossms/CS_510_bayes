Alan Keyes had it right when he wanted to go to a national sales tax and lower income tax. The current system of taxing income rather than spending encourages people to earn less and spend more. The Keyes system would encourage the reverse. If he had run more seriously, people would have at least had to look at his ideas just like Perot forced us (especially congressional and presidential candidates) to look at the deficit and the national debt. Count me (a white woman) as a Keyes fan.
