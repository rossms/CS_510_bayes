I have a KV-36FS13 that I bought in July 2001. The piture is great but just this week the red standby/timer light stated blinking and the piture went blank but the audio is still working. Ther is a 96 dollar charge from sears to just look at the sony!! I still have to pay for parts and labor. The piture tube is covered for two years. There is no mention of the standby light in the manual so i have no idea what the problem could be. Great TV when it works, but for the money it should last longer than this.
