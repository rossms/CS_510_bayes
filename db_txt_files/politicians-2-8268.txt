Seems many are ranking Adams based on his entire life which is not what we are supposed to be doing here. We should be rating Adams based soley upon his presidency. And he was a poor president. When you have the Alien and Sedition Acts synonymous with your presidency, you don't qualify as a very good president, do you? If I were to rank all forty-two presidents from best to worst, Adams would probably shake out around twenty-nine or thirty.
