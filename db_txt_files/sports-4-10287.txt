For the longest time, Stoops seemed to be content as the best defensive coordinator in the country, first at Kansas State and then at Florida. I guess he was just waiting for the right situation and did he find it. The interesting thing about the job he has done with the Sooners is that he has done it with offense and not his signature defense. With Josh Heupel leading the way, the Sooners have one of the most high-powered offenses in the nation. Stoops sure wasn't used to losing in his previous jobs and he has brought that winning attitude to Oklahoma. I expect to continue to see big things from him.
