Koontz missed the mark with this one. The Bad Pleace took forever to read and I can barely remember anything about it now. I do remember that one of the characters is a retarded kid, but in a stroke of non-genius Koontz makes him into one of the more intelligent and sensible people in this novel. This one just didn't ring true for me, and was one of the reasons I avoided Koontz for a while during the mid 90s. Thankfully this poor novel was only a speed bump.
