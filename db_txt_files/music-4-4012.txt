It's not Queen's most shining star. Yet for an album made in the 80's with synthesizers, it's still enjoyable to rock to. The classic and brillant song lyrics are still there. This was around the time where all 4 members started to write all their songs together. Best examples of this are in the songs 'Breakthrough,' and the title track (A real true vision for the hope of peace and harmony). Freddie can still sing like no other, and Brian still lays down the licks and solos (so all keyboard haters don't have to be too worry). It's no 'Night At the Opera,' but is nejoyable nonetheless.
