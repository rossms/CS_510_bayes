Was better than that 1st, godawful prequel, but it's still crap. The clusterf**k fight scene at the end was interesting, but I wasn't impressed by the Yoda fight, and it could've been a fantastic scene. They also screwed up the origin of Boba Fett. The romance really blows. This kid playing Annakin sucks. I'm still asking myself: who really cares what happened before Star Wars?
