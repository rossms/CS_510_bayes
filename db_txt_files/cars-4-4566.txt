I love my truck, I have a 2001 Frontier XE 4 cyl. It is the best truck I've ever driven. Aside from some trim and seal issues this truck has never let me down. And as for the person who asked about driving something All American, they are nothing but junk. I worked for GM for 10 years and have owned a few before and they are crap. Transmissions fall apart, Engine knocks, just plain junk. Don't get me started on AC Delco parts that literally fall apart. Don't knock it until you have tried it.
