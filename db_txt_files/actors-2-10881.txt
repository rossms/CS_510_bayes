Quality, classic, once-beautiful actress who has become a parody of herself over the years. She was once a thing of beauty - now she's scary as hell; she once had respect - now she's a joke; she once had talent - now she is partnered with Richard Burton as 2 of the moost notorious over-actors of the 60's. Her association with dubious characters(Michael Jackson) and gutter journalism adds moore tarnish to this fallen star's mantle. Liz, time to start growing old gracefully.
