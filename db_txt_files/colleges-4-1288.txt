Excellent school with great name recognition and a reputation as one of the best of the non-Ivy schools. It's Ivy caliber though and even looks like an Ivy school architecturally. Doesnt offer a wide range of majors though and the women there are downright fugly. Really, I went there on a Friday afternoon in the Fall , great day....sun was out, weather warm and I didnt see any cute chicks. NONE!
