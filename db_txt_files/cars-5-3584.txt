Very nice vehicule. It doesnt resembles the previous one, and it rides on Michelins. Awesome cornering, great ergonomics, good acceleration, and above all very safe. If you ask me for recommendations, buy one. A year and a half and over 60,000 miles in it and it still runs like the first day.No problems to report.
