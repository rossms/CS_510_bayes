This guy has NBA written all over him. Even in the tough Big Wast conference, Hakim is literally playing at another level. He can just get higher than everyone else on the court, and like Villanova coach Jay Wright said, letting Warring touch the ball on the block is like letting another player catch it in the paint - it immediately becomes a really high percentage shot. I'd be shocked if he's not a top three pick next year.
