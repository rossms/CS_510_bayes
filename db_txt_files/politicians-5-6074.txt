I think this guy is great. He is brave and effective; although, I think The President needs to keep a tight reign on him to ensure he doesn't convey the image that he is operating on the fringes of violating civil liberties. Mr. Ashcroft is another wonderful and courageous part of the already solid Bush cabinet. Bravo!
