On first viewing, Matrix is like a punch to the gut. It's fast paced, intense action that leaves you gasping for breath. But what I liked best is that it made me think something not many action flicks do. It challenged my perceptions of the world and the limits that humans put upon themselves. Do we use our mind and body to its full potential? I don't think so, especially not after seeing this movie.
