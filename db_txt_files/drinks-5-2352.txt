Attn I have a bottle of Christian Bros Brandy that has to be 30 years old. How would I find out really how old this bottle is? It still has the red tariff lable still unbroken. The bottom of the bottle says 84 L circled and 82. 92503 6 Please be so kind as to help me find how old this bottle is. Thankyou and a Mery Christmas and a Happy new year.
