If there is one thing that New England is good for (other than freezing your scrotum off) it is good microbrews. Samuel Adams is one of those Microbrews that just happened to make it big, and it is obvious why. I'd still rather have a Shipyard Ale (Maine) over it anyday, but I'm glad I can find it here in Georgia.
