Accomplished, brilliant, principled lady whose career is something to take great pride in. Imagine the obstacles she has overcome to achieve her present position and then imagine the unfair sniping and backstabbing she has had to endure on her way up. The shameful comments of the reviewers on this list represent the mentality but nowhere near the volume of sniping she has ignored with grace and dignity. Being black somehow obligates you only to accomplish things on the left side of the spectrum, you're not entitled to develop your own ideas. Aunt Tom! What causes that disease?
