After traveling all over the world and seeing how others live/work/play, I am SO GLAD to be here in America and am very proud of ALL Americans. Yes, there are a few bad apples wherever you go and it does pain me to see some folks take it for granted every now and then. However, you will never find a greater place to live, work and play in the universe.
