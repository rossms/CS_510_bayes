Land Rover could take a lesson from Toyota. When I was in the military humping around Afghanistan all you saw was landcruisers, some of them fifteen or more years old. In a country where rocks are high tech car repair tools, I think it's a testament to just how well made Landcruisers (and all Toyotas for that matter) are built.
