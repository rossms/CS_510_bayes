In Australia, where I'm from, this was the scotch that opened up a market for single-malt whisky. This class of drink is really only for those who appreciate the particular characteristics of whisk(e)y and is generally too expensive to mix - a practice which some would consider culturally offensive in any case. Glenfiddich is one of the best beginner's single-malts with as it is not exhorbitantly costly, is rather smooth and not too challenging.
