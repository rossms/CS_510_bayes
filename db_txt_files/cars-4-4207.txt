Have a 2000 MPV. Excellent handler; comfortable; good ergonomics; 2.5L v6 a little weak for hard acceleration, otherwise fine; foldunder 3rd row seat and removeable midseats are great. Didn't need a bigger van and didn't want one. Reliable for 75,000 miles and counting. High step-in hard for elderly.
