I'm not ashamed to shop here. If you only need shoes to wear for a short period of time, consider payless. But some of the shoes hurt and some make your feet sweat, so be warned. They do have some cute shoes though. This is also a good place to buy shoes for babies and toddlers, since their feet grow so much. The workers help, but they aren't cheerful and they don't really care.All in all, a good place to shop if you're only planning to wear them a little while.
