Please. She's versatile, yes. She can lessen almost any role. She was mediocre in Ghostbusters, annoying in Working Girl, and was so desperate that she was willing to do all of those Alien sequels. What a waste of celluloid. I guess if I were a movie producer and I wanted to make a new potential star look good, I'd put them in a movie next to Sigourney (what is a Sigourney anyway, a new type of brussels sprout or something) and make them look good.
