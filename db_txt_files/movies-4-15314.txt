Well, what can I say about this movie? I loved the acting in it, I loved the plot, I loved..everything about it! Connery really surprised me in this role. Don't ask why, but for some reason..I never really thought of him as a first class actor. He was amazingly good, and made the character he was playing so interesting it kept you wanting more and more.
