Impressive ultra-modern skyscrapers in the downtown area. I was amazed during my first visit to Nairobi, I didn't expect that kind of development for an African city. The city is clean, very green and the weather is not too drastic for travellers arriving from the west. The Carnivore Restaurant is the best I've ever visited anywhere in the world, exteremly superb. The hotels are excellent, especially The Grand Regency on Uhuru Highway. I would definitely encourage anyone to visit Nairobi...you'll love it. Spectacular!
