This was a beautiful and heartwarming film to watch if you feel you need something feel-good. For this is the ultimate of feel-good. Makes you laugh, makes you cry, the performances are top-notch, this is a great movie. Maybe not as memorable as some, this is still a beautiful film which deserved Best Picture '89. (Mainly because it wasn't a very good year for films). Driving Miss Daisy was the film of the year. Summary: BEAUTIFUL AND HEARTWARMING.
