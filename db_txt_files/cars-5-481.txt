Had a 2001 Goldwing and after receiving the Honda Riders magazine and saw the changes, I bought a new 2006. The changes along with the Navigation are fantastic. I also own a Lexus with navigation but it pales in comparison to the goldwing navigation. Try it and I truly believe that you will be as impressed as i was. Only complaint is that the seat heater doesn't get warm enogh.
