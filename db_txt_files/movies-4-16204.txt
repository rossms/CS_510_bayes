I really liked this movie. I almost quit watching, it moves pretty slowly for the first half but once you get into it,you just can't turn it off. I'm glad I stuck it out, it was very original and I loved the way the characters came to life. Bruce Willis finding out who he and Samuel Jackson were and what was going on was excellent. I'll watch it again. I know I missed a lot the first time.
