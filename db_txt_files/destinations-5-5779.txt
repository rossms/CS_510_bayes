Too hot!? I find it funny that people that live up north say it is too hot. I admit it is hot in the summer, but how about the other 9 months? That is right, it is beautiful. Other people's justification for living in cold weather is that you get all 4 seasons! Seasons! Screw seasons. I would rather be hot than cold any day of the week. You can take your season of winter (snow, heating your car, ice, and overall depression) and shove it.
