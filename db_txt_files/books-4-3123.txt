In Pet Semetary, King postulates that perhaps bringing a loved one back from the dead isn't as great as it's cracked up to be, especially if you have to climb up a rugged slope to ancient Indian burial graound to accomplish it. What it they come back, well, different? Very interesting, fast paced, exciting book. A must read.
