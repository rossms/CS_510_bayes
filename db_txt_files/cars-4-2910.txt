A very nice car. From 1993 and up they are well built, handle superbly, and are very fast. I owned a 1989 Iroc-Z with a 305 V8. It was quick, handled well, and looked good, but wasn't as nice as the Ford Mustangs I currently own. Camaros are great sports cars, but the Mustang is a better overall drive; more comfortable and better equipped.
