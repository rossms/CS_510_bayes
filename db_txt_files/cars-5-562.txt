FAST, comfortable, complient and user friendly. To me when riding or pushing it, is seems like a small, lighter than it is bike. Don't have to hunch over but I can when I want to. What it really likes is an open road ahead of it. Running a Yosh round stainless quite quiet, but it has saved me from the cops a few times already. 142 indicated on the way back home today excellent. The wind protection is better than you would think. Seat nice, no hot spots. Couldn't be happier. A crotch rocket that is comfortable and useful. Published 10.7 quarter mile stock, 140's at the crank, over 125 HP to the ground.
