This actually could've been a good movie with a good editor--actually, ANY editor would do. As good as the concept was, there were scenes that dragged on endlessly with no purpose whatsoever. Just killed any momentum that movie might have had. I recommend watching this movie, but only with your finger on the fast forward button.
