I've only been to NYC, so I can't say much about the state as a whole. I do love the city though, so why not rate a five? However, I'm mainly putting this comment up here for one reason: The spirit of the city on and around 9/11 probably would have happened anywhere in this country, even in many places overseas. I don't think that type of behavior in a tragedy is specific and unique to New Yorkers.
