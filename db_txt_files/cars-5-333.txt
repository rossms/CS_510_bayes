patriotism is not the same thing as brand loyalty. swore to god i was never giving another dime to harley. stumble into a polaris dealership. three years and sixty thousand miles later the bike has been bulletproof. comfortable as a couch. 80mph works out to about 3500rpm, have done 7-800 mile days. there are a few drawbacks. she still backfires. and 40mpg on a good day. plus, the dealer network is really thin in the southwest. still, i'm never going back to HD.
