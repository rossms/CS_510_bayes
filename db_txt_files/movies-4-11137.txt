Since Jim Carey has now acted in such a variety of movies, I wasn't sure if this movie would be good or bad. With his reputation, I actually excepted the movie to be a lot funnier, but it was still decent. I especially enjoyed his sons, -they brought a lot of character to the movie. The small cameos by athletes such as Anna Kournikova also surprised me.
