I like McCain. At times it seems like he may have lost his mind when he steps WAY OUTSIDE the party line, but overall I can't say its a bad thing when he does it. He usually makes more sense than that line when he does and is one of few Republicans that those silly Liberals are willing to listen to. He works hard and cares about what he does, a quality rare among all the fools we have in government.
