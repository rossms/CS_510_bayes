The fourth book in the Dark Tower series and a severe disappointment. The first three books in this series blew me away and I expected this book to be something special. That didn't happen. King returns to fantasy storytelling like he tried in The Eyes of the Dragon, but falls flat on his face here. There were at least two occasions where the buildup led to nothing at all, and I felt almost betrayed at the anti-climactic nature of the storytelling here. I had high hopes for the Dark Tower novels and I hate to think that King may not conclude these stories up to his own high standards.
