Probably the best our planet has to offer. The problem is that it keeps you working so hard to live here you never get to see much of it. As for all this crap about rites and religion i don't see the problem. Your free here to probe someones anus or Worship God if that's your thing. Try living in a muslim country where your Jailed for farting.
