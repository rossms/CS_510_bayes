An excellent defensive minded coach. He is far from the best offensive coach, but Marty still manages very well with developing a consistent running game. However, he has never in the past been able to develop consistent recievers or QBs. He is considered by many to be too conservative, but I remember from the many times I've seen him both with the Chargers and the Chiefs that he's went for alot of fourth downs and such, including ones he shouldn't have.
