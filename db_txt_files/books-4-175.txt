I just finished reading this book. It was about Michael J. Fox. He told of his life growing up, his acting career. and he talked a lot about his life with Parkinsons disease.I have always liked Michael J. Fox and I have a real respect for him since he has been willing to talk about what it has been like dealing with this life long illness. I was touched by his honesty in this well done autobiography. I would recommend this book.
