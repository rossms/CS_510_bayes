Hooray! They finally got the fifth one! One for the thumb. I've respected and admired this team a very long time. Since the 1970's when they had their "dream team", the Steel Curtain. Pittsburgh Steelers - World Champions - 1974,1975,1978,1979 and 2005. Congratulations Coach Bill Cowher and Jerome Bettis on finally becoming World Champions!
