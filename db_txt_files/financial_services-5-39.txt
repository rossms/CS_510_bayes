i've had nothing but good experiences with USBank. they have a free checking account and no balance you have to keep in there all the time. if you keep up with your own banking records you shouldn't have any problems. i did mess up one time cause i forgot to write something down in my register. the CSR at the branch actually kept my register for a day and balanced it for me, showing me my error and refunded the charge i had because i had never had that happen before. i'm very happy with them.
