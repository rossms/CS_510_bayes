Even die-hard fans of the first 3 Chucky movies, may not be able to enjoy any of this movie. Jennifer Tilly who seems like she can carry on the role as Tiffiny, barely shows up for any of it. Intead she lends to the voice of the doll, Tiffany who has just fell in love with our serial killing maniac doll, Chucky, played by the original 1988 chucky, Brad Dourif.
