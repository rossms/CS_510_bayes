What can I say about this system? Sure, it doesn't have the graphics of an XBOX, but hey, it's better than a Gamecube. I reckon this is better than XBOB because it is compatible with PS1 games. The only flaw is that PS2 games are really too expensive and SONY may think about bringing out PS3 soon. It can also play DVD's, though you should get a real DVD player if you can afford one.
