This has got to be one of the most capable ATV's ever produced. Outstanding handling, very comfortable ride, plenty of power, especially for a 400cc engine. This is the fastest 400cc utility bike produced. All the controls feel like they are of very high quality, and are set up in a smart arrangement. All in all, the best of the best in its class.
