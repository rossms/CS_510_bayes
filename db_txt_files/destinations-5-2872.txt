You can hate this place and love it at the same time, as I do. But it doesn't matter, it is pretty much, the center of the universe and the energy that exudes from here is enough to make it constantly feel like the place to be. New York is the Land of Kings. It's influence is very far reaching. Too bad it's not also the Land of Queens - that maybe has to go to California, at least in the USA.
