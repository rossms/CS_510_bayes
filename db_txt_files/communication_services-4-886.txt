i have been with sti for maybe 1 and a half yrs.. i like them and i just got the samsung a660 from them at staples cause now they sell the phones and paid 99 dollars but got a rebate for 99 dollars so yeah!! it was free.. so maybe the comp usa this was true... i love them now they offer internet service on phones for nineteen cents a day and like 2 cents a min or something like that..
