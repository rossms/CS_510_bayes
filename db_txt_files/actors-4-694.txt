I love to watch him on the screen, but I wouldn't want him for a neighbor. His character was crude, drunken, mean to women and children, lazy and given to telling lies. But, as much as it pains me to admit it, I find him very funny and I don't know why. I guess, at times, we have all wanted to say the things he did, we are just to nice to do it.
