I finally got around to seeing this movie after months of hearing all the hype, and surprisingly, I liked it a lot. The acting was outstanding - the little boy and his mother were exceptionally good, and Bruce Willis showed a surprising versatility. Tip: if you want to be especially freaked out when you watch this movie, bring your laptop to bed and watch the DVD with the lights out. It'll make you a little jumpy - I promise.
