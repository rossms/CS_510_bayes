The President of Trinity College is doing so much to integrate the College with the Hartford Community that soon it will be a great, not just a good, college. As the parent of a present student, I see students not taking full advantage of all that is going on and only wish that these same students could realize that there probably won't be another learning opportunity like this in their lifetimes.
