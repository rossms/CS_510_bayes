Mediocre in every sense of the world - and what's up with the new Subway ads? Eat Subway sandwhiches and you'll lose 400 pounds? Is that really the best thing that they can say about their food? UPDATE: I've become a believer. I like the fresh bread. It is definitely healthier than almost anything else out there. And finally, Jaryd has won me over in a big way (as has Clay Henry).
