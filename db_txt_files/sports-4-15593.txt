Has absolutely NO RECEIVING CORP and still and a sub par running game and still drives the team to the NFC Conferance game. For that I give him props, but he is vastly over rated. I mean he does choke and I have seen him made some bad passes that should of been gimmes in his career. But over all he makes it in my Top 5 of QB's playing in the NFL
