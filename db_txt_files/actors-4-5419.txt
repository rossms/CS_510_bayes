Rob Lowe is one of those celebrites who can tell their story of bouncing back after a serious scandal almost ruined his career. I really think that he has evolved and has become a better person due to his experiences. As far as acting goes, he has never given a bad performance in my opinion. He was humorous in Wayne's World and Tommy Boy . He also gave a great performance in The Outsiders . He is one of the best TV stars today with his performance on The West Wing . A good actor.
