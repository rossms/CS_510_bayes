Maybe the best movie to be made from a skit on SNL. There are some pretty good laughs scattered throughout, but not really enough to sustain an entire movie. If you are a fan of Wayne and Garth you won't care about that. I can remember laughing out loud at several scenes: a sphincter say what? , I LOVE you, man , exsqueeze me, baking powder . Wayne and Garth have become icons.
