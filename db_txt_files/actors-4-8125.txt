I absolutely loved her in What Ever Happened To Baby Jane? All About Eve, but she loses a star for the twilight years, movies such as The Nanny Hush Hush Sweet Charlotte. I guess maybe she needed the money, but it's a damn shame to see someone once great playing in The Nanny. She was a great actress and a very strong individual...she just didn't finish strong.
