This is the Star Wars trilogy of children's books. The parellels are uncanny: precocious young boy (Luke/Harry) violently separated from his parents in youth. Boy is unaware of his mystical powers until they are revealed to him by a stranger from the wilds (Obi Wan/Hagrid). Plot revolves around a character of unspeakable evil who is somehow connected to his parents (Darth/Voldemort). Both stories are superficially simple, but wildly popular because they tap into some deep mythological vein. I just hope J.K. Rowling never writes a book as bad as 'Phantom Menace.'
