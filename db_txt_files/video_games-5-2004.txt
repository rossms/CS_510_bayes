This is the #1 game in america! If only they make a sort of sequel to it from the GCN console. I grew up with OoT since 5 years, and I still play it. It took me a very long time to beat it. You can laugh if you want, because beating the game quickly doesn't give you a gaming experience. Beating OoT without using NP mags or internet cheats gives you the best gaming experience!
