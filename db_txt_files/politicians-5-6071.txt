John Ashcroft is a great Attorney General, and yes, he is enforcing laws and protecting our constitution. I haven't lost any of my freedoms since the Patriot Act has been put in place. I don't think any of the anti-Ashcroft bashers have as well. Face it folks, George W. Bush is not the moron you wanted him to be and he will be re-elected and Ashcroft will be Attorney General for four more years.
