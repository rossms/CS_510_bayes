I would really give this about a 4.5. the cast is real good. From Henry Fonda as Mister Roberts, to Jack Lemmon as ensign pulver, to James Cagney the captain of the ship.Mr, Roberts want more than anything to leave the ship he is on to be transferred to a more active ship{it is wartime} Ensign Pulver is a prankster trying to get enough nerve to stand up the hated captain. James CAgney the ship captain is an S.O.B. hated by all with unfair rules and punishments. AN all around funny movie . ONly sad at the end.
