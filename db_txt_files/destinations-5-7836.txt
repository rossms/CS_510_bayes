When you walk into the Field Museum, the first thing you see is the most preserved T-Rex skeleton in the world across from a giant wooly mammoth, in a gigantic marble hall. It looks exactly what you'd expect a natural history museum to look like, and indeed it covers everything - getting through this entire museum in even an entire day is impossible. It's perched next to two other major Chicago museums, in one of the most spectacular parks along the lakefront. This is really a can't miss museum in Chicago - only the Art Institute begins to approach its quality.
