Sly Croom has brought much more to Mississippi State than just being it's football coach. He done more in 9 months uniting the races in a State considered the most racially fractured in the country than any man in the last 25 years. He will become a great coach for his integrity, dedication to young men becoming true scholar athletes, and setting a standard of moral and ethical character not often seen in college sports.
