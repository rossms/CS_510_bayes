I have nothing but the fondest memories of Chutes and Ladders. I remember getting this game as a gift from my parents when I was about five or six (after losing my first baby tooth). I highly recommend this game for youngsters five through nine years of age. It teaches the benefits of good behavior and the consequences of bad behavior, yet in such a way that it's still fun for small children. Any game that can be both entertaining and educational isn't half that bad. Parents, help get your little ones off to a good start on the road to growing up -- play Chutes and Ladders with them.
