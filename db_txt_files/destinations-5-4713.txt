I live in Detroit and damn it's a nice city! Some of you people on this website are just idiots!! Not all areas of the city are nice but what large urban city doesn't have high crime areas. I live in a nice quiet beautiful area of the city. I can't wait to raise my future children in the city. Also opinion585 comment seem a bit racist!!
