Naples is one of my favourite cities. It is my kind of town. Wild, fun and a great city to relax in, this crazy place is full of excitment. I love looking at all the photos I took around the Plaza Garibaldi. You could just live there! Great place. There are so many things to see and do there, I am going to go back. Naples, watch out - I am on the way back!!!!!! I guess they survived Nelson.
