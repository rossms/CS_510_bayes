I LOVE IT HERE!! The people are nice and normal. The city is close-by, there is plenty to do all the time, and the college and city are clean. The campus culture is awesome. I highly recommend coming to Boise State. Don't let the stereotypical "Idaho potato farmers" hold you back. I haven't seen any of them at all.
