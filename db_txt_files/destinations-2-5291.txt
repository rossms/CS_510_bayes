I spent two years outside of Philadelphia and can honestly say that I would not consider moving back. Navigating the poorly maintained roads is nearly impossible owing to the fact that the roads change names every other block. There's the King of Prussia Mall (mildly entertaining for the first two hours) and all the touristy stuff in Philly but other than that, not worth your time. Center City is dirty and the people can be rude and shallowminded. I've met nicer folks in New York City.
