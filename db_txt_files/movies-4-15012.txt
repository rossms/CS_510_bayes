Good Hanks/Dicaprio movie offers quite a few laughs and some interesting chase sequences, without being at all violent. The film however does lose it's spunk half way through the film, and the entire film becomes repetitive. Thankfully, we have two great performers who are making nice efforts to aid the film.
