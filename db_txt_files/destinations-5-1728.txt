Ecuador is a fantastic country for travellers. It's a small country that is very accessible for foreigners to travel in easily and it has a little bit of everything. From the Amazon, to the coastline, the Galapagos Islands, to some of the highest peaks in the Andes all within a short distance. Take the local buses when you get up into the mountains and see indigenous people dressed in their native clothes without Nike baseball caps etc.
