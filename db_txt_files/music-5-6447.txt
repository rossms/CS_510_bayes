Believe is an excellent album, not as good as The Sickness but very close. David Draiman(vocals) has not lost the voice and NEVER will. Words cannot describe how incredible this band is. Ozzy Osbourne once said that Disturbed is the Future of Rock. The Ozz man cant be wrong. I'ma Believer(new album) will be comming out very soon!
