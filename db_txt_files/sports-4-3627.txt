Sadly swallowed whole by the shadows of Mays, Marichal Cepeda, Willie McCovey may be the only poerhitter in history to've earned his nickname, Stretch , from a defensive attribute. He hit 521 home runs, same as Ted Williams. Led leagu in home runs 3 times, RBI twice. 1969 MVP. It's nice to see that the new Giants stadium has an area named after him(McCovey Cove).
