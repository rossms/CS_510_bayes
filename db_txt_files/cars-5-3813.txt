I have only had my 2004 ford escape for 4 months but I love it. It drives like a dream and has plenty of space. I could not find anything that compared in price or looks. I also own a 2004 Acura TSX. Two different rides but I would have a tough time choosing one or the other to keep if I was forced to get rid of one of them. Value wise the Escape wins hands down.
