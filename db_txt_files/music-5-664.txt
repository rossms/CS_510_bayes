This album makes a great atmosphere with every song. Trent does it again. Could be some of his best work, work that has been repeatedly slammed by critics just because he's been on hiatus for a while. That's not even fair. Open your ears, critics. The two years he spent on the album was worth it. And every track is new and exciting compared to his old stuff, yet still the Trent we know and love. God bless you, Trent. You've changed the way I look at music.
