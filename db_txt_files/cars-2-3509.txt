Constant little problems. Purchased 1 year old, 12K miles. Window stuck down on cold rainy day. Gas door remote broke, no way to open with our screwdriver, felt like it had no brakes, went through brake pads very fast. 4.0 engine lacked performance, 13MPG on highway! dealer service very expensive. Excelent in snow and off road. Would not recommend for every day use.
