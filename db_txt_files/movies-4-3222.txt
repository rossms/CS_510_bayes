awe, come on it wasn't all that bad. well i guess the characters were written rather flatly. and meg ryan didn't impress me with her first attempt at drama. perhaps it was crowe that held the movie together. i hadn't seen gladiator when i saw this one but he still blew me away. i also liked that the main hero wasn't american which was a fresh change. and that the ending was alright. lately most of the movies i've seen have been miserably ruined by bad endings.
