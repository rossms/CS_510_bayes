What a succesful franchise needs: a smart quarterback, a reliable runningback, a solid offensive line, and a tenacious D. Dallas has....a D that plays most of their series, but not all of them. The Tuna has alot of work ahead of him. It'd be a miracle if Dallas could knock off Phili or New York, so it'll be a battle to stay out of the cellar of the NFC East with Washington. Unfortunately for the 'Boys, Washington has the edge. This may be the hardest rebuilding job for the Tuna yet.
