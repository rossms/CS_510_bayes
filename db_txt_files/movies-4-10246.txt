This movie was good. The story was dry at some points in time and the ending was more than a little disappointing. But all in all it was a fun movie with a wonderful soundtrack. Some of the things she does make you wonder, what kind of small town girl with morals she is, but it just goes to prove that no-one is perfect and we all do what we have to, to make it in the real world. (Even though this is far from the real world)
