For me Illinois mostly means Chicago, and I do like Chicago. It's a city on par with any other in America, but the people are much warmer than Boston or New York (though the weather, unfortunately, is not). Pretty decent mass transit system too, especially if you live near an El. It's got it's problems and it's share of bad spots but it really seems to be on the right track at the moment. The few times I went down state I liked that pretty well too. For someone so used to mountains the landscape was a little blah, but it's pretty in it's own way, and the people are nice.
