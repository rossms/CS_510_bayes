It's just as bad as all the other Canadian beers. I just don't get it with folks and the Canadian beer - we have some excellent US beer (see my ratings on a few) and great beer from all over the world that is readily available here. Do yourself a favor and choose one - leave the Labatt Blue for others who have no taste and can't appreciate really good beer.
