I just purchased a can of Grizzly long cut wintergreen to give it a try after being fed up with the price of skoal, kodiak, and cope. I was quite surprised. In my opinion, Grizzly tastes almost identical to Kodiak and packs better than skoal and cope. For $1.76 a can, Grizzly is definitely worth it.
