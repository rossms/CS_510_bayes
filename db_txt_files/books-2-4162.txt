You should have been going to school in the fifties when this came out. Many monkeys who taught any kind of comp or writing class had the poor suckers under their thumb writing essays about Holden Caulfield and teenage angst. My advice to you. Avoid at all costs and if forced to read, start drinking heavily before picking up the book. I only suggest legal substances but I'm sure some of you could look to your other alternatives before you would be forced to read this tripe.
