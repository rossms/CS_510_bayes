I have been riding for aoubt four decades now and went from Harleys to Goldwings about 26 years ago. I currently own an 1982 GL1100 Aspencade (original owner) and I thought she was the best bike going. NOT! Three weeks ago I bought a 2001 Valkyrie cruiser and fell head over heels in love with her. For such a big bike, she handles very well and has power from hell ! I can't rate how she handles on long distance rides yet or how my butt would feel after a 3,000 mile ride, but as a cruiser, she beats all others hands down. So now I have two ladies to ride :-)
