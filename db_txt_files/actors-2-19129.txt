Michael J. Fox had better add his initial in his name along with Michael instead of Mike --- and he is far from a fox. HE CANNOT ACT OR GIVE A REASONABLE FACSIMILE THEREOF.I do not think he has XXX disease. I think the head of ABC said keep Spin City with the likes of Jason Priestley and Charlie Sheen but get rid of that worthless twit called Fox.
