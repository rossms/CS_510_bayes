I would say this book is Introduction Part II to the series. As the story, writing, and characters become increasingly more interesting, this book does a great job setting you up for the rest of the books. You can see already the books becoming a little darker. The humour of Lockhart's character was fantastic, and I'm glad that he doesn't disappear after this book.
