Pabst gets Five stars Because PABST IS GREAT. Sure it might not be the snobbiest Beer, Its definetly Not the best tasting, But it was voted BEST BEER IN AMERICA in like 1876!!! Seriously Folks. ANd the Blue ribbon really does JUST HAVE SOMETHING ABOUT IT When People Whine about the PABST what they are really saying is I have no Beer Drinkin spirit. When Someone Turns down a PBR just turn Your head and let it go, chances are they just aren't worth speaking to.
