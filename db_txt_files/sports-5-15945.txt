This guy is easily the Best QB in the NFL right now. Two SuperBowls in the the past three years. What other current QB has accomplished that? None. His accomplishments at his age are remarkable. He's gutsy, smart, and an accurate passer. I'm so glad the Pats beat the tacky, bandwagon Panthers and their sour-puss faced owner. And to all you Bucs fans, best of luck with Brad Johnson as your QB
