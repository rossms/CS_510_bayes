Sickly sweet. The characters are all quite cute, so much so, I felt a little guilty that I found this movie rather boring and predictable. Perhaps it's my ignorance of Greek culture that undermined my ability to enjoy it or maybe it's that my generation has brains so addled by juvenile sexual innuendo and mindless voilence that we can so longer appreciate a warm, fuzzy, feel-good romantic comedy anymore. In any event, this movie made me snicker once or twice but never laugh out loud.
