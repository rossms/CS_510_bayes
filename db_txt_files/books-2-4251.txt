Any work which requires the modern reader to look at at least 10 footnotes per page is probably not even worth the effort it takes to dissect. I am one of those individuals who would subscribe to that theory regarding Joyce's work. I will admit that reading an intelligent essay written about Ulysses and Finnegans Wake is not at all an unjustifiable exercise.
