They should rename the executive of the year award the Jerry West Award. The logo kept LA as the best franchise through the 80's and 90's. Jerry brought in Kobe and Shaq and kept the peace. He then goes to one of the worst franchises in sports and now they are in the playoffs and may even get home court in only 2 years!!! I'd like to see Phil Jackson do that.I hate the Lakers but I respect and admire Jerry West. If I was a GM I would never answer his calls. He has the midas touch.
