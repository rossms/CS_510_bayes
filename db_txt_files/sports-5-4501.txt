Jim B. has one championship. That alone puts him into comsideration as an elite coach. You'll never see another coach like Wooden with a half dozen or more championships. Knight, Coach K with 2 or 3? Okay, they're great too. But back to Jim B: the guy is consistently outstanding! That also makes for greatness.
