Starbucks has remained one of the consistently best fresh consumer products in existence. I've tasted coffee in several European countries and from every restaurant chain in the U.S., not to mention some very upscale establishments. I've consumed enough New York deli coffee to float a battleship. Some of Starbucks varieties I like much better than others, but if you truly like hot, fresh tasty coffee with some kick to it, this is still the best place to get it.
