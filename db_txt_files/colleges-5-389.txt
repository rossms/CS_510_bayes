Erasmus is a modern campus and consequently not a beautiful one; however, like most things in Holland it is professional and very well organized; prices are incredibly reasonable, English is widely spoken, the professors are often very well-known in Brussells, the Hague, and London; and after all - life as a student in Holland is like no other. 5-stars for Erasmus
