Winco is THE place to shop. People always say that other stores have better costomer service, but whenever I go to places like Albertson's the employees annoy the hell out of me. The lines are sometimes long, but at other stores you could have one or two people in front of you and the checkers are so damn slow it takes about the same time anyway. Winco has the best prices for the same product and I couldn't see myself needing to shop anywhere else. Thanks WINCO! Frenso, CA.
