I read a Wrinkle in Time a long time ago. I recall the beginning on a dreary, stormy night and Mrs. Who, Mrs. Which, and another Mrs. something. I'll never forget the depiction of the planet where people walk out of their house at the same time, and do every motion in complete unison. It was kind of spooky, like Orwell's 1984.
