Haley Joel Osment gives the best performance by a child actor in many years. The script is fairly tight, with the exception of why it takes Bruce Willis' character so long to figure out, well, you know. I enjoyed the film a great deal but have to admit that everyone talked so much about the surprise ending that I had it figured out halfway through the movie. Overall, this is a very effective film.
