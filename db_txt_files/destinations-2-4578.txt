I'm originally from Texas and not a fan of Houston. It's dirty, rainy, and unbelievably humid for a great deal of the year. The highways aren't easy to navigate and since there are no zoning laws, someone can build a Taco Bell next door to your house. That said, jobs are plentiful it is a good city to earn money in. The cost of living is low (housing is cheap). I've always said I'd be willing to suffer there a year or two in order to get a good start and earn better than average pay, but then I'd move to some place way better. I wouldn't recommend living there for the long term.
