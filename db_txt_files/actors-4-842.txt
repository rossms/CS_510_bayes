A very remarkable career. It would be so easy to acknowledge his stature by excluding the few occasions when, for whatever reason, his vehicles or performances were less than sterling ('Cruising'; 'Bobby Deerfield'; '...And Justice for All'; 'Dick Tracy'; 'The Recruit'; and, yes, his comic - misplaced? offensive? - pseudo-Cuban caricature of an accent in 'Scarface', I fear), but there is pleasure in recalling his outstanding contributions to: 'Serpico'; 'Dog Day Afternoon'; 'Godfathers 1-3'; 'Glengarry Glen Ross'; 'Donnie Brasco'; 'Carlito's Way'; 'Insider'; 'Sea of Love'; 'Heat'; 'The Merchant of Venice'.
