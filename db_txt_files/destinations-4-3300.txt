Chicago rebuilt when the whole city was burned to the ground. San Fransisco rebuilt when it was in rubble from the earthquake. Both came back bigger and better than ever. With some hard work, hope, prayers, and optimism New Orleans can come back to a bright future. Realistically this will take years and years but New Orleans is too important to just abandon and leave behind. It will come back again.
