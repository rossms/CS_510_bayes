I'll admit that I'm biased because I went to high school with her. While I can't defend her intellectualism, I will say she is not the brainless slut that people assume. It's true that she's gotten a boob job and shows a lot of cleavage, but what successful Hollywood starlet doesn't play up their sex appeal? She actually has lots of natural charisma, especially apparent in TV appearances and in the good notices she received for Scary Movie.
