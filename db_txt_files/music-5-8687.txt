THIS IS A LAUGH-YOUR-ASS-OFF KIND OF VIDEO! I ABSOLUTELY LOVE IT!!!! IT'S HILLARIOUS AND A KICK-ASS SONG TOO! OH MAN, THE BEST PART IS TOTALLY WHEN THE HILLARIOUS DRUMMER, TRE COOL, IS A DRAG QUEEN! NOW THAT'S PRETTY FUNNY, BUT IT GETS BETTER! HE DOES CARTWHEELS IN A DRESS!!!!!!!!!! IT'S SO FREAKING FUNNY!! OR WHEN TRE FALLS OUT OF THE BACK OF THE CAR!!! OR WHEN HE'S LAYING ON THE WINDSHIELD ACTING LIKE A FREAK!!! AND THEN THAT ONE PART WHEN BILLIE JOE IS RUNNING NEXT TO THE CAR!! IT'S ALL FUNNY!! I LOVE THE SONG AND THE VIDEO!! GREEN DAY ROCKS MAN AND THIS VIDEO PROVES IT!!
