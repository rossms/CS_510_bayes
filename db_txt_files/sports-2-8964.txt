He has a sweet shot and has potential. The only problem is his attitude. He is a crybaby. He whined his way onto the Olympic team. He complains about people not passing to him or him not getting enough minutes. He needs to shut up and realize he is still young. He will get his chance when he proves he is worthy of it. Shooting a field percentage of under 40 is not good for the team.
