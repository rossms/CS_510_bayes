I started eating Spree a long time ago. I've always liked the sweet tart kind of thing, but Spree are better I think, plus they last longer (could it be their size perhaps?). LOL. Sprees are perfect to have beside you while playing multiplayer Quake 3: you can just pop one in your mouth in a hurry. :) Anyway, I thought they were one of the best non-chocolate candies out there... until they came out with Chewy Sprees. OMG! They're even better than the original ones. Sprees are on my Top 5 non-chocolate candy List.
