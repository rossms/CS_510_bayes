What a gorgeouse video. It reminds me of a beautiful dream. It is like a moving portrait. And for that to be matched with Sade's sultry, smooth and soothing vocals makes this one of the most stunning and memorable videos I have ever seen. It is, however, rather slow and I would imagine hard to pay attention to if you are not inclined to this level of artistic video makeing. This is not a Limp Bizkit or DMX video. But for those of us who can sit and take the time to watch a truley remarkable video, this is one for you.
