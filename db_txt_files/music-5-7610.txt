Fantastic song with abundance of rythm,melody,promising intentions,seductive,it captures your heart and imagination.I am over thirty and this song makes me feel alive,simly the song of sunny days somewhere on the tropical island with the smell of ocean and love. O,and RICKY! He can sing nothing and you can hear the music of his heart!
