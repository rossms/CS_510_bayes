Grungy album anno 1999 ? Wow, these guys are really original ! Between all those rockbands who are experienting with computerstuff at the moment, the STP's just made a real rock 'n roll album. I love bands who just keep playing the music they were playing when they started, but also keep on growing with every album. (although Tiny Music was a little miss step as I think so, but maybe others don't agree with that) STP's ROCKS
