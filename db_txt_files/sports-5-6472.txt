UK fans can take note that their team is nothing compared to their past seasons. Now, this year's IU squad has good aspirations to get to the tournament and make a statement. Its a tradition that deserves a rebirth, though final four appearance might not happen, anything elite 8 would be amazing. Again, Wildcat fanatics, stop abusing the state north of you, read a book or chew on some bluegrass.
