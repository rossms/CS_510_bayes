He is, of course, one of the best hitters in the game. No on gets on base for him, yet he still gets 102 RBIs this year really says something about his hitting abilites. In the history of great third basemen, it just amazes me that Chipper Jones, baseballs most underrated player, got 6 straight 100 RBI sesons. No other 3rd basemen ever achieved this feat. And people, he is only in his late 20s.
