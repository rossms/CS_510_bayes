He's a Bush so that's good, but what the hell kinda name is Jeb? Florida is old and has minorities, so I'm surprised a Republican with his family name got in there. Of course this state almost got us stuck with that tree-hugging moron Gore, so maybe they just can't make up their minds about anything...
