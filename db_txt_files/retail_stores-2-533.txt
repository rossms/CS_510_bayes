Used to shop there a lot when I ws in high school and college in the 90's. Back then the clothes covered a bit more skin and were more tasteful. Now there's too many trashy outfits. Their jeans always fit me well, until I discovered CK, but they were not very well made. That's my big beef with this store overall- who cares how revealing or trendy the outfits are if they fall apart after a few months? Another place that's just gone downhill.
