You have to separate Banff National Park from the town of Banff. The town is a typical tourist town -- lots of expensive shops selling souvenirs -- maybe not so typical, though, because not too many tourist towns have elk wandering through them! Look beyond the town, look at the incredible Rocky Mountains surrounding the town. The park is much more than the town, and you'll never find more beautiful country.
