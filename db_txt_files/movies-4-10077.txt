I came sooooo close to giving this 5 stars, it's great! Even though I have a thing with cancer and the ending made me spew up, it is hilarious, great, funny, and sad. Jim Carrey is excellent, should've at least got a Best Actor nomination at the Oscars. Rent it, it's worth it. It takes you to a very special place indeed. Summary: FUNNY BUT SAD FILM WITH JIM CARREY GIVING A BRILLIANT PERFORMANCE.
