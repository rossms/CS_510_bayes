The Red dwarf series of book are a good way to pass some time, they have good plots (some new, some from the the TV series) and the characters are great characters. However the books themselves seem to fall just short of the greatness that the TV series achieves. Don't get me wrong, they are entertaining and in no way damage the legacy of the sereis but they aren't worth 5 stars.
