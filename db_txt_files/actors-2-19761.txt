I was never a big fan of him, even when he was starring in movies aimed at my age group. I still don't think he's a very good actor now, but you have to take into consideration who his movies are aimed at -- preteens and under. So, I guess I can see a little girl looking at him and envisioning her dream guy, but I think he should try for a more mature image. Stop with the JTT business and move on to more challenging roles.
