I would luv him to come back with the Knicks. We need his heart, energy and desire. Spree's not getting much money. That contract the Timberwolves offered him was a complete insult. He's got to feed his family for God's sakes. ... I'm making $50,000 a year and that's not enough. I want $65,000 because I gotta feed myself and my pets.
