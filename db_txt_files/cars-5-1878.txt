Great follow-up C-Class! Little tight for those over 6'2 , but excels in every other category. Purchased the hands-free telly, which makes for great eye-candy an a compelling conversation starter! Could use better gas mileage and tires. Completely satified wih my purchase. Would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a wonderful and reliable luxo-cruiser.
