Just a step below the first three SW films, but still very good. Of course, I agree with most people when I say that Jar Jar Binks should have been at the very most a minor character. Also, the most charismatic person in the whole film--Darth Maul--is seen very little considering the effect he had on the outcome. The special effects are naturally a knockout, and no one does that as good as George Lucas. However, I wish he would cut down on all that computer generated stuff. What made the first three films so good was the heart and humanity and all that computer stuff takes the human-ness away from it.
