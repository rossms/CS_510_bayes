I've been to Gloria Jean's only twice but both times I liked it. I liked the coffee and did not think it was too strong, bitter, or acidic. I like the fact that it was also a coffee store and you could buy anything from accessories to mugs to high end coffee machines, as well as their selection of coffees. I don't get over to their location much any more but so far they are two thumbs up for two visits.
