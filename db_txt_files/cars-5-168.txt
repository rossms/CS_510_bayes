I love this machine. We had a honda 300 before the rubicon and loved it also, but wanted more power so we bought the rubicon. This machine will go anywhere. We trail ride in Quebec alot and it handles those trails beautifully. I am on 5'2 and this machine fits me nicely. Great job Honda. I will forever own one...Hcrawford
