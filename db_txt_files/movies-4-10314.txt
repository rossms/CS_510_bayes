I thought that this was quite good and funny. Came close to giving it 3 stars though, mainy because it's a bit stupid at times. But mainly, this is a funny, usually intelligent film with lots of animals. Not much goes wrong. The sequel's good too. Summary: A FUNNY, USUALLY INTELLIGENT BUT SOMETIMES STUPID FILM.
