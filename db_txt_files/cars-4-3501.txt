The Highlander slots neatly between the RAV-4 and the 4Runner in Toyota's extensive line up of SUVs. It's not too big nor too small. I got the chance to test drive a Highlander and believe me, its the most carlike SUV currently out there. This is one SUV in which you would not feel uncomfortable driving around town or in the shopping mall parking lot. I wish I had one. Toyota has another winner on its hands, too bad eat your hearts out haters.
