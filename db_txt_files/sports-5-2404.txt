Great may be a little thick. The Brewers will win a division title soon and there is reason for optimism. Bud is selling the team and this is the right thing to do. I would have prefered an open air stadium without a roof but either way Miller Park is still top of the line. When the Brewers win again you will see support exceed that of teams in larger markets such as the Angels, White Sox, Mets and A's. I'll drink to that.
