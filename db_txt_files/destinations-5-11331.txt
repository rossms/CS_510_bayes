We moved here from Monterey California 7 years ago & would never leave. This area has it all. Do yourself a favor and visit us! Constant events, better gaming than Vegas & the food is unbelievable, not to mention the golf and fantastic fishing! Southern hospitality at it's finest with semi tropical Gulf of Mexico weather. Sweet spot
