This state seems to be getting a bum rap. Sure it's flat in many parts but the positives far outweigh the negatives. The people I've encountered there are very friendly and the cities are vibrant (Columbus is a great progressive city). The southeastern section of the state has nice rolling hills as well. A little too sports-obsessed in Ohio, but that's a minor complaint.
