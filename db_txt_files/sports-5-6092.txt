I had always assumed that Gerry McNamara was this scrappy white kid - not overly gifted physically, but able to compete in D1 because of his pure jump shot, hard nosed style, and handle. That's not the case. The guy is a freakish athlete. I saw him in warm ups at the Big East tourney catching lob after lob with two hands and throwing it down, occasionally from a vertical jump. At 6'2, there's just not many folks who can do this. I had no idea.
