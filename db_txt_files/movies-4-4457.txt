I like this movie I love to watch it around Christmas. They really stuck to the book. I like the little extras too like the grinch as a kid and it shows why the grinch hates Christmas in the first place. My favorite character is Max the dog. I think that Ron Howard did a good job directing this movie. I thought that Jim Carrey did a pretty good job as the Grinch. I like how they made whoville look is was really neat and how they used the makeup to make them look a lot like the whos.
