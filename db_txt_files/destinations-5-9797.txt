Okay- Noone is debating wheither or not smoking is the best health trend since water, but if you're going to spark up, then you should at least get the best. Kamel Red Lights are the best!!!! I have been smoking them since college. I have converted everyone who has ever smoked them. They have a smooth and sometimes nutty taste. Red Lights are the best. So, I say smoke 'um if you got 'um and if you don't have them, then you should get them!!!
