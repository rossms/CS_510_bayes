i just wanted to give this book 5 stars, but here's a comment anyway. it's heavy, it's deep, it's about religion. what makes something real, is there a god in the machine, do men have souls: that sort of thing. it's not really comparable to blade runner, since they are entirely different. to get a real idea of where dick was coming from, read 'valis'. this book, in its own right, though, is a heartwrenching masterpiece.
