Pretty cool movie if you can get passed the often below-par cgi work. As a comic-book movie, it succeeds with surprising gusto. Having said that, I feel the producers did take advantage of that (the scene were the New Yorkers are throwing things off of the Brookyln Bridge at the Green Goblin is a stretch). Willem Dafoe's character (both of them) were rather thinly-drawn in my opinion. But overall, Spider-Man is a good movie.
