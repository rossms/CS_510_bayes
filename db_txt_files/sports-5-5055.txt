For you folks who have only watched basketball since 1990 or later: Imagine Dwayne Wade with Vince Carter hops and Michael Redd's shooting stroke. That would be a modern equivalent. He could block shots at heights previously only reached by players like Russell, Wilt, and Kareem. Inch for inch, the greatest player I have ever seen.
