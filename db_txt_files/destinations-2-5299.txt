Spent a year in Philly when I moved from the west cast before settling in New England. PA is two real distinct regions, Philly and Pittsburgh. I liked Philly the most. And its the cheapest large city on the east coast. The rest of the state is rather slow and not too forward thinking-nice scenary in some areas, but gray and depessing in others- Its too bad that PA. has a stupid religous nutbag for a Senator like Rick Santorum- which drags this state down.
