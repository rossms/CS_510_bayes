Claire Danes acting talent is exquisite. It has just enough selective principle to it. Meaning that her roles seem to be picked intelligently, even pour roles like 'Mod Squad', or 'Brokendown Palace' are necessary for an acting career. Aside from her abilities in acting I think that she possesses a strong sexual charm about her. One that is delivered through her slim back and daring eyes. She is a temptress, she just hasn't shown the public yet.
