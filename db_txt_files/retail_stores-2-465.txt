I can't seem to understand the fascination of boring clothes for insanely high prices. Is it just the in thing to do, pay $120 for a pair of jeans that you could get somewhere else for less than half the price? Or $44 for a short sleeve shirt? Even their sales racks seem to be overpriced, and all of the sizes that I wear are gone, leaving size ones and size eighteens. Definitely do NOT recommend to those who don't have money to burn.
