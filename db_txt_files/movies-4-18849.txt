The movie itself is enjoyable to watch. The writers took the basic werewolf tales of past and created an expanded and innovative storyline. Though it's considered a horror classic, the movie des not really provide any real thrills (except looking at the great and hideous make up desgin of the dead people). The effects and costumes are great for the time period the film was made (Jonathan Landos - the same man who helped create Michael Jackson's thriller). IF you've never seen this movie before, it's definitely worth checking out.
