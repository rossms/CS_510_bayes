How do they not go undefeated in their conference? They really can't be considered a Cinderella team anymore (Virginia caught a rough break getting this 12 seed in the first round). People look at them like they are a bunch of overachievers, but if you watch them play, you'll see that they are talented with some really good athletes. Dichow and Cavalry could lead them to their first Final Four.
