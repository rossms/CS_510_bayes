My experience with MCI has always been great. (Since 1985!) The only time I had a problem with my long distance service was because of my local telephone company switching me. MCI worked quickly and professionally to get my service back up. THANK YOU, MCI for opening up the long distance market!!! Without you, we'd still be subjects of Ma Bell's Monopoly and wouldn't have anyplace to go when we don't like what we're getting!
