Great Park! They have just added an excellent audio walking tour that uses your own cell phone. Very easy to use and the tour fee helps the park. You get a very good presentation on Paul Reveres midnight ride, the battle at the North Bridge and other sites on the park. More info at http://www.nps.gov/mima/CELLPHONEAUDIOTOURS.html
