I like MCI very much. I have there Neighborhood plan. I just want to inform all these ATT lovers and Ma Bell lovers to what they are really up against. If it wasn't for MCI there wouldn't be competition in the Long Distance market AT ALL! MCI was the one that took Ma Bell to court with an anti trust suit and got them split up and started competition. So even though you might be paying 5 cents a minute right now with ATT. You can thank that good rate to MCI since if they hadn't sued ATT youd still be paying the 40 cents + rate that you were before due to lack of competition! Thanks MCI I love you
