One of the best games we've played. Adults to my 10 year old play this on a regular basis. It's a great way to spend an evening with family and friends. You roll for a destination from your home town and then receive a pay-off. Buy a railroad or wait to get one later. Roll for a new destination and do it all over again. Plan your strategy because you need to pay to ride the rails; $1000 to the bank, $5000 to an individual, & $10,000 to the individual after all the lines are bought up. When you amass $200,000 and you can try to get to your home city to win.
