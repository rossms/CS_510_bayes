I have had my 2004 Sentra 1.8 for 21 months. So far the dealer has had to replace the driver's seat cover 5 times, the passenger seat cover 2 times and the rear seat cover once. The fabric keeps coming apart at the seam and always at the same spot. The dealer will only replace the cover, which remedies the problem, but does not cure it. I got the nissan to have trouble-free driving, but that is not happening. In case you lost count I have had 11 different seat covers in 21 months. Beware!!!
