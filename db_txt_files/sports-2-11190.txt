Lloyd's got to go. This man has taken a program with tremendous tradition (most wins in Division 1 history) and turned it into a program which is living on the reputation of past successes. Yes, he won a co-national title in 1997, only because Michigan did not play Nebraska in the pre-BCS days. Otherwise, his tenure is characterized by underachievement and waste of talent (look at the UM alumni in the NFL). UM is now a perennial 8-4, 9-3 team. This may be OK at Kansas State or Ole Miss (no offense intended), but UM should have higher standards.
