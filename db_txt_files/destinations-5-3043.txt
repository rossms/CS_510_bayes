I have been to this city 10 times from 1986-2003. It is my favorite North American city. The compelling hills, and 'view vista's' are stunning. Union square has been revitalized- and looks great! Great food, bars and culture, some of the most interesting building styles of any city. Diverse and tolerant- hallmarks of a successful city. Climate is temperate- not hot or cold, with little humidity. Pricey yes- but worth every cent.
