Being a newly diagnosed diabetic, I religiously pore over the nutritional content, especially the carbohydrate number. I am a Marie Callender's frozen food fan but was outraged to realize that after eating a whole frozen chicken potpie that I had eaten TWICE my normal allowance for carbohydrates per meal. I wondered why my blood sugar shot up after eating that potpie. After doublechecking the nutritional label, the potpie is considered TWO SERVINGS!! How deceitful this is and how dangerous for people on restricted diets. Shame on Marie Callender's for not being honest.
