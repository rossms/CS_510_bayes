I admit that Cap'n Crunch with Crunch Berries is almost sickly sweet and that the neon-colored crunch berries are a bit much, but I still wouldn't pass up an opportunity for a bowl. I used to love this cereal as a kid- I have fond memories of picking out all of the crunch berries while watching Saturday morning cartoons.
