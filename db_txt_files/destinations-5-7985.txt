Beautiful neighborhood, with one of the best ice cream stores in Denver right down the street in a neighborhood called Bonnie Brae. But Midwesterner19 is absolutely right - a little falling apart house near Washington Park will set you back nearly half a million dollars, whereas a brand new condominium just north in beautiful LoDo will cost you $350,000. It's exactly the reverse of what you'd expect.
