Ok, so it did tell the history of Middle Earth, but it was one of the most boring books that was ever written. Tolkien just didn't plan this one out right. It took me a week just to get past the first chapter, mostly because I kept falling asleep while reading it. Don't get me wrong, you can learn a lot from J. R. R. Tolkien if you study him, but the Silmarillion wasn't written for laughs or adventure, it was written for the history. Most people are into the Lord of the Rings for their sense of Adventure, not the history behind Tolkien's created land.
