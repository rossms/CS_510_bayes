Ricky is handsome in denim, Christina is casual and feminine, in this video. Their background is the magnificent architecture of the Biltmore Hotel. The song is a lovely ballad with understandable lyrics. Ricky sings with an understated passion, to the viewer and to Christina. Her voice is a beautiful and decorative addition to this lovers plaint. I could have wished that their voices blended more smoothly in places, but the visuals, assembled under the direction of the accomplished Wayne Isham, make up for that lack.
