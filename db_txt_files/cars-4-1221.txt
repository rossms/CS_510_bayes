As a driver of a '97 model, the Corolla wins hands down in the three Rs - refinement, resale and reliability and will run circles around any Cavalier/Sunfire or Neon. My only gripe is the car's overall lack of distinctive personality. Is it as fun to drive as the Honda Civic? No. Is it as flashy as the Pontiac Sunfire GT sedan? Again, no. One other thing: the Corolla, mine at least, has the worst sounding factory audiio system out there with only two front speakers standard. This can be easily remedied though by having two more aftermarket speakers installed behind the rear seats.
