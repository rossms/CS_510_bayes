Alright, take everything you like about Star Wars...Clumsy soldiers with bad aiming capabilities, Lightsabers, and throw in the fact you can actually DECIDE if you want to be good or kill everything and let the force sort it out. Running off the Neverwinter Knights Role Play Gaming engine, this game takes place 4,000 years before Luke, Leia, and Anakin and covers the rise and fall of the Sith Empire in it's third Revival.
