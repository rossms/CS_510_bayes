To everyone who says they've had real Mexican food and this isn't real Mexican food, do you think we're morons? I've been all over Mexico and have had real Mexican food, we know Taco Bell is not authentic Mexican cuisine, that does not mean we don't have a craving for it once in a while. it's fast and conveniant and makes a cheap lunch, I'm not gonna take someone there on a Saturday night for dinner.I eat at Pizza Hut sometimes also and I know that's not true Italian cuisine.
