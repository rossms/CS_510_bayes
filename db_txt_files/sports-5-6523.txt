If I'm a blue-chip hoops player who can go anywhere, Stanford would be one of my top choices. First, it is obviously a great school in a great location. Second, the hoops team has become a power that you can expect to compete every year. And third, Maples Pavilion is becoming Cameron Stadium West. What a great place to play ball.
