Like the previous reviewer said, possibly the greatest solo Beatle album. Almost every track is great on this triple album: two of songs, one of jams. My favorites are "Isn't It A Pity," "The Art of Dying," "Beware of Darkness," and "Wah-Wah." I could do without the album of George just jamming with his pals, but it's still a great album. Contains the hits "My Sweet Lord" and "What Is Life?" as well.
