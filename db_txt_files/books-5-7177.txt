This is a 5 * book for me due to the fact that it's weird. Definitely not atypical - a tale of a rooster who rules his coop and surrounding land where an evil monolith (Worm) resides in the earth's core. As Worm's evil escapes, Chaunteclear the rooster must figure out how to defeat the basilisks that are flooding the river and encroaching on his kingdom. It is definitely an adult read, however bizarre. Wangerin's detail and imagination keeps the reader on the hook!
