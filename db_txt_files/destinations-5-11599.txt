I can't think of a better place in the U.S. to spend Spring Break. It's relatively cheap to fly to, has great weather, has a constant carnival atmosphere, beautiful people, sun/beach/ocean, and clubs that stay open until noon the next day. The only thing that might be lacking is the anything goes mentality of being in another country, but some would argue that anything DOES go in this place.
