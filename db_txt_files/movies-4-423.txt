Shake the dust off Roman History, because this film charting Russel Crowe's progress as Maximus, a general, then slave pit-fighter, and finally master of the world, enlivens the whole genre of history films. Director Didley Scott knows violence, and films it well, in the most thrilling action movie since Bloodsport. Actors succeed across the board, especially the mad Commodus, the plot does not dissappoint, and according to history buffs the facts are close to right.
