If you are in South NZ make sure you take the rather long bus ride down to Fiordland National Park. The ferry ride through the Fiordland on a clear day, like the day I went, was amazing. I saw seals, waterfalls, and just overall amazing scenary. The most amazing part is looking directly up 1 km at a 90 degree cliff straight up from the water to the sky. Truely amazing. Just don't forget your camera on the bus or you may be tempted to shoot yourself like I was. Thankfully my mother had a camera I could use and plenty of film. What are you waiting for GO!
