The ivy league school of the Southwest. Those who have attended this great school certainly would not underrate it, but its greatness seems to go unnoticed by those on the East and West Coast. A beautiful, small Victorian-architectural style campus set in a beautiful mid-town area of Houston. I only wish I could have been so fortunate to attend this great school.
