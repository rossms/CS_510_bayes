I sampled Captain Morgan Parrot Bay Mango-flavored rum once, and I did not perticularly enjoy it. I took a few swigs straight, and it felt like instan heartburn. Seeing as I suffer from acid-reflux, getting the sensation of heartburn is less than satisfying. Not what I look for in a higher-quality rum.
