The song Jeremy is based on a true story about Jeremy Wade Dell. He lived in Richardson, Texas and went to Richardson High School. In 1991, he killed himself in a classroom full of students. I lived in Richardson at the time but went to a different high school. I heard about it when my bus driver asked some kids why they were out of school and they said a boy killed himself at school today. It is a sad story. We need to teach our children how being cruel to others can really affect someone's life.
