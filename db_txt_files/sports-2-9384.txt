Big Dog is more like Big Dogpile. He's personally accountable for getting Randy Ayers run out of Philly. Since coming to Philly, he has been playing Operation Shutdown. He's a scorer who can't score and is woeful in all other aspects of hoops. It's only poetic justice that the Sixers made it to the NBA Finals over the Bucks by virtue of a missed jumper...by Big Dog himself.
