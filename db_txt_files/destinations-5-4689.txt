St. Louis, the Gateway City. I've been to all the big cities in the U.S. and I still think St. Louis is the best. We have all the perks of big city life (classic architecture, cultural institutions, great restaurants, walkable neighborhoods, unique character) without the pretensious attitude of many other cities. It's a gritty old Rust Belt city, yet it's sophisticated and laid-back. And I am convinced that people who flock to Chicago and other hot cities are suburbanites who have never taken the time to get to know the city. I love St. Louis.
