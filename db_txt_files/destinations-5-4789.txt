Rio is relaxing and beautiful, but stay away from the parts of the city where tourist are not so common. Dress up like local. Do not use tennis socks and keep your T-shirt outside the shorts. Don't wear a Hawaii shirt. Don't bring a video camera when you go out on your own. Keep the money in one pocket and THE MONEY in another. If you get lost, where you shouldn't be and someone try to rob you, give them the small money (20-30 Reals) and they will leave you alone. They rob you with a smile in Rio and even call you sir or madame doing it.
