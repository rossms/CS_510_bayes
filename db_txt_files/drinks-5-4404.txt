I was strictly a bourbon and vodka man when it came to spirits until I tried a Glenlivet, I was pleasantly surprised. It's packed full of delightful flavors, goes down like silk and has a wonderful, lingering finish that I can't describe, you'll have to try it for yourself, I don't believe you'll be found wanting. After sampling other malts, I've decided to stick with Glenlivet, especially the 18-year-old. I highly recommend this nectar of the Gods to anyone who's never tried a single malt whisky.
