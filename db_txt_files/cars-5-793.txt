I have a 2000 GT Avalanche that I bought on sale for $900. I put over 1000 rough miles on it (500 last summer), and it has held up very well. It has only required the regular maintenance and replacement parts (tires, rear derailleur, cables, chain, cassette), and I'm confident it will take me through a 1000 mile summer when the snow melts... very happy with it!
