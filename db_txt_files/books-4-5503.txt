pretty good. Takes place during the civil war. A soldier named Inman is at the infirmery injured he walks away'to go home to Cold Mountain to his girlfriend Ada. hundreds of miles away. the book goes between Inman travelling and Ada at her homstead trying to survive the war. One chapter we read about Inman and what he encounters on the way. and the other about Ada and her farmhand friend Ruby.it tells all about the hardships through the war. pretty good some of it kind of drags on but for the most part a good read.
