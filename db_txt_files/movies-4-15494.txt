If you go see this movie, you're not going to see high tech special effects or great action. What you're going to get is a well written and well acted (I didn't even mind Kevin Costner's Boston accent too much) film that is actually a true story. When our ideas of film or TV presidents today are Martin Sheen and Michael Douglas, it was great to see the backroom dealings of a real president, JFK, as he struggled with the biggest decision of his life. If you like history, you'll like this movie. If you are more of a fan of car crashes and big explosions, you may want to wait for video.
