The movie is excellent, hadn't it been that I don't like fight movies, and that's at least 95 % of this movie. Anyway, I hope it'll win the Oscar for Best Film (if so it'll become the first foreign language film to win this prestigious cathegory!) that it totally will get more Oscars than Gladiator! Go, Crouching Tiger! :-)
