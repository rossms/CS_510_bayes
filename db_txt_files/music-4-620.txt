This Cd brings me back to college, pre partying with my girlfriends and having Alanis singing in the background. Or we would blast it in the car, sing along, and be those obnxious group of girls but it was so fun. That pretty much sums up what the cd is. The lyrics are great. You can scream them at the top of your lungs and feel great after. When I am feeling nostalgic, I put in this cd.
