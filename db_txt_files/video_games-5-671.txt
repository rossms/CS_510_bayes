I play this with my uncle who has always been into history warlike stuff. My first time i played i got the hang of it and didnt even know i had been playing for hours. I very rarley win but it is fun to try and gather armys and after the game trying to get people to listen to what happened and what went wrong in your plan. The rules arent that hard to understand as long as you have an excperienced player to remind you what the rules are every once in a while. It may be difucult but i am ten and i can do it and its fun
