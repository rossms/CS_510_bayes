Well of course I think this is the place to be and see in Boston. I still remember the first time I went, and as I got out of the cab in front of the place, another fellow pulled his car up on the sidewalk and got out. A cop looked at him and said You can't leave that here or we'll tow it. The owner replied, Yeah I know, I'll pick it up later. and tossed the cop his keys. I've always thought of this place, and Wrigley, and much as I hate to say it Yankee, as Green Cathedrals.
