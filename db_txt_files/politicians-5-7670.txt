Jefferson: one of the best and brightest U.S. Presidents. A giant mentally and historically. Yes, he owned slaves, and he rightfully gets dinged for that. However, he had enough good qualities and massive brainpower to make some amends. One of the greatest minds in our country's history, along with Benjamin Franklin.
