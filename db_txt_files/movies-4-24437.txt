Good escapist fare. Yes, a bit corny and somewhat gory in a cartoonish way. But for two plus hours of getting away from the real world it does what it was made to do. Paul VerHoeven (a dutchman) used the Nazi-style in a way that did not sit well with Hollywood's Jewish contingent, but like the song sez you can't always get what you want. I'd much rather see movies made in a balls-to-the wall fashion than those that are hardly more than 90 minute music videos.
