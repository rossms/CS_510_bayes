I was really pulling for the Colts this year. I was just glad there was another team being talked about other than the damn Patriots. Was very disappointed in the outcome of the divisional game as they just looked rusty and unprepared to play. I guess Peyton Manning has to get monkeys off his back one season at a time. This season it was beating the Patriots on their home turf in Boston, hopefully next year the monkey shaken off his back will be losing in the playoffs. Then we can enjoy seeing him in the Super Bowl.
