There is nothing more bizarre than going to a Fridays in another country. If you get a chance, check out the ones in Sao Paulo, or Mexico City, or Caracas. It's like halloween or something... I mean they are following the corporate directions to the letter, but somehow it ends up coming out like something from bizarro world.
