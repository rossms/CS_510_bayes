Whoa, talk about hype! I remember very well when this movie was released and how people were actually scared to go see it - as though they could somehow end up in the same shape as the head turning Regan just by watching it. Though the heavy-duty buildup had a few points in common with the shameless promotion of The Blair Witch , unlike that empty promise, this film actually had the horrific substance to back it up. Exaggerated, but completely bone chilling, The Exorcist is still a bit hard for me to watch without feeling a little sick to my stomach, depressed and, well yes - SCARED - eeeek!
