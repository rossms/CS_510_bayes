If you EVER had a doubt that the Cowboys are America's team, go to any away venue where the Cowboys are playing and see if you can find a home team fan amongs't all the blue and silver that the fans of the Cowboys are wearing! Think I am BS'ing, just swallow your pride and see for yourself. It is an amazing sight to behold.
