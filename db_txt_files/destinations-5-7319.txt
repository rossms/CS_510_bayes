What's utterly special about Naples is its surprise. I never expected it to be so beautiful - each tiny, meandering Medieval street beckoning you to the next. If you're a history buff, Napoli will leave you famished. The current city was built above the medieval one, which was built over the Roman one, which was built over the Greek one. You can traverse 50 feet down beneath the city via tunnels and find an exciting and ancient world. Plus the seafood is awesome, and so is the pizza.
