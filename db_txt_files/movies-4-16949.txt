Richard Gere did a great acting job. The sex scenes were too explicit. I didn't like the end either. Why didn't the wife realize all she was throwing away with her crazy behavior. So in a rage, Gere hits the guy on the head and he dies. Somehow it doesn't seem fair and then we are left to feel sorry for all of them because everyone was hurt due to her giving into temptation.
