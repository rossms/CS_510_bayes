Twix bars would be so much better if there was more there. You don't get much for what you pay for, and even then it isn't that great. If I wanted a cookie, I would buy a cookie, not a candy bar ! And the peanut butter twix are just nasty. If you must have one, I recommend the caramel twix over those peanut butter ones.
