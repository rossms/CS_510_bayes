Well, an almost 4 . A cute movie. but very predictable. No real surprises. Kate,and Matthews characters work for separate magazines and each are writing an article one How to Lose a Guy in 10 days the other How to get a girl in 10 days. Has some cute and amusing scenes where each one try to win and lose for their article. Of course as predicted each end up liking each other. No spoiler here since most know the way these movies go. What keeps in nice is both stars are likable and do a nice job in their roles. Not a great movie but nice.
