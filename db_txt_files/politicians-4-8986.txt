Clinton had concentual sex with another adult and he happened to be married. That is not a good thing to do, but good people do bad things. Clinton kept other countries happy while we enjoyed the greatest economic expansion in our history. Clinton was the only president you could make fun of from morning to night, but you knew the country would be okay. He's a smart guy who can think for himself. He was never a puppet to his advisors.
