A very good game. Good range of weapons and the setting and plot is highly developed. Who doesn't enjoy shooting combines with the anti-grav gun? Just watch the beautifull ragdoll effects take place. Zombie levels were fun and exciting. Some of the best graphics i had ever scene. Very hardware intensive, luckily i had just got a new computer when this came out. Very player invloving gameplay, makes you feel as though you are really there. A top-notch game.
