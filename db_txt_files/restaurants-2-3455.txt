I remember it being a special treat when my family would go to Pizza Hut back in the 80s. The pizzas were hot, fresh, and right out of the oven. Cheese tasted like cheese and we didn't feel cheated on the amount that was oozing all over our pie. Today, Pizza hut pales in comparison. The cheese tastes strange, the pan pizza is no longer the pan pizza-the dough is gross. About the only thing that is still good is their salad bar when dining in. They are still one of the few maybe only fast food chain that offers creamy italian dressing at the salad bar. That dressing is the best!
