Newport Cigarettes are the only cigarettes i smoke. Although they are the worst cigarette for you I love the menthol taste. Stay away from Newport 100s, they really taste like crap compared to regular Newports. I am also hearing that Newport cigarettes contain fiber glass which tear your throat up. But Newports are my favorite. Best tasting cigarette out there. Also smoking a Newport after smoking weed stimulates the high.
