Undeniably, the best first-person shooter ever made, and one of the best games ever made. Sadly that is no carried into the 007 games for Game Cube. See Goldeneye was made by Rareware, the last game they made was Star Fox for Game Cube; now they are done for good. The new 007 games are made by EA and are really bad; tons of programming errors that makes the game annoying. True Goldeneye fans will be happy to know that the programmers from Goldeneye were highered to work on the game Time Splitters 2. I got it and it really is the hier apparent to Goldeneye, though nothing is the exact same.
