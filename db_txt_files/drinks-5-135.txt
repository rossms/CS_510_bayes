I love Yuengling, because it is a higher quality than the Buds and Millers out there, but is still really inexpensive to buy. I've found it funny though on several occasions when I have seen Yuengling listed on restaurant menus as Imported. Its from America's oldest brewery dumbasses...how could it be imported.
