Darla's acting was fine as a kid, but her singing was even better. When Our Gang started making mini-musicals in the middle 1930s, I sincerely believe she was the kid who sang the best out of them all, unless you counted some of the non-regulars such as the Cabin Kids (the African-American singing group) and the Bryan Sisters (the bespectacled little farm girls). At any rate, Darla was simply adorable.
