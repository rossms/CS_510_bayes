Houston is a good coach, but not a great coach. On the upside, he is a good motivator, connects well with college kids, works hard, and loves the university. On the downside, he hasn't gotten his teams prepared for bowl games, hasn't brought enough great players in to get the program to the top, and is mediocre at calling plays.
