i have been dipping the long horn wintergreen for about 2 years now since it came out i have became very used to it and have no trouble with it mostly becouse of the prices of name brand being 4 bucks plus a can but here is a tip stay away from the natural flavor it tastes like a combination of dirt and dried leaves may as well just dip folage
