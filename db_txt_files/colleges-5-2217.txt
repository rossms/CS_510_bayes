I don't know what school birch45 is referring to, but Amherst College is really terrific. I'm currently a student there, and I really like it. It's a bit small, but the classes are excellent, the professors are engaging and knowledgeable, and the students are quite intelligent and usually very nice. I'd definitely recommend checking it out.
