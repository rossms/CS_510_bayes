An excellent easy war game. I have killed many a weekend (and enemy army, navy and air force) with good friends, abundant pizza and beer, and this game. Considering the simplicity of the rules, the strategic possibilities are surprisingly numerous. Don't try to capture Britain too soon, and think of creative ways to use countries that weren't active in the real war!
