In my opinion, the best player in college basketball. Explosively quick, strong enough to finish on the break, and with a tremendous handle and outstanding range - this guy has all the tools. It should be no surprise that he was able to dominate Tim Hardaway when the Olympic team played the college All Stars - simply put, Williams is more talented at this stage of their respective careers. I would be shocked if he (and not the overrated Battier) doesn't lead Duke to the national championship.
