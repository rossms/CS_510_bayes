Since I was a kid this guy has been my favorite. When you hear the way his former players talk about him and thier relationship with one another you know he has had a lasting effect on their lives. If not many players want to play that style of ball then maybe fundamental basketballs' days are numbered. The man is an institution, a hall of famer, and a legend.
