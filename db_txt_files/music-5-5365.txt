Don't know how he does it but somehow Steve Earle just keeps getting better. I love the tracks John Walker's Blues and Ashes to Ashes and Jerusalem is a surprisingly optomistic look at the Middle East situation... yeah, definitely time to play this album again - must be a good 20 hours since I last heard it.
