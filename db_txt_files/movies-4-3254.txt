A fun, entertainining movie. The boat scene at the beginning is outstanding, and there is enough action to keep it interesting throughout. My only regret is that the tall, Spanish looking woman who was trying to kill Bond in the boat scene is killed off - in my opinion way too early. I think she had a lot of potential.
