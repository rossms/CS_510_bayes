Never impressed me like some. He has ATTEMPTED to have range but his efforts in comedy were very bad. Other than a few strange characters he doesn't have as much range as some people think. A few times he has really done well. Such as in the Shining. A fine performance. But overall he doesn't rate as great to me.
