As far as chain-owned steakhouses go, this is the nation's best. Consistently top quality and always a treat. Elegant, tasteful and none of the fake-Aussie or -Texan hoopla that is aimed at the masses. Obviously you pay a little more for quality, but it is always well worth it. Have eaten in their restaurants in NYC, Washington, D.C. and Florida - quality never varies in food or service, it is always top-notch for a chain.
