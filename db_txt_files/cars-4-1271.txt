I admit the style of this car took some time to grow on me, but now I think I like the chiseled look that Cadillac was going for here. This chiseled appearence has made it's way up the Cadillac ladder to it's other models as well, and I think it is creative and original and at least takes a stab at giving Cadillac that standout appearence that is deserving of a Marquee brand. I reserve a 5 rating for the CTS-V.....Boy that things a monster!
