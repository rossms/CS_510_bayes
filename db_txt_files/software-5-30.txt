Really glad I bought this software though I did'nt know much about the company that made it - Fbm Software. Quite impressed with its performance, no hassles installing it on my PC and from there performed a scan that finally removed this annoying toolbar on my browser. My PC would sometimes freeze up with all these ads coming in. It wasn't like that before and I also have broadband. Plus customer support was great. I highly recommend this software for those who want to clean up malware hidden in their PCs.
