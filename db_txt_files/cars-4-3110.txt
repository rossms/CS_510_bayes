I spent some time on a beautiful weekend tooling around the streets of SF in one of these. It's pretty fun and has some punch to it. The car's so tiny you feel like you're in a matchbox car or tricycle. I see a lot of these in the city because they're small and easy to park. Girls love to drive them and guys, well plenty of guys in SF anyway also own one. It's a chick car but it's an affordable convertible and fun to drive.
