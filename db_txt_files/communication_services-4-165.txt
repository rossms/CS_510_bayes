I have had Verizon for 2 years now, and I have loved it. Almost everywhere I've gone I've had a good signal and I love my phone. The only problem I've had was when I had to change numbers due to a relocation. When I needed this done, it didn't work so I had to call their customer service. Luckily, they got the phone number changed. What they couldn't do, however, was get all the services working, like the roaming signal. Other than that Verizon has worked for me and I think it will work for most people.
