Titan A.E. is a pretty bad animated feature, because mainly it is extremly violent and overtoned in too many scenes, and it's not exactly what people are used to seeing in an animated feature. The world has been destroyed by evil robots, but their are some survivors who can save the rest of the universe. It sounds just as bad as it would animated.
