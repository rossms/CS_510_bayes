Because of people like Jesse Jackson, people who are not afraid to speak up against oppression to the Black Race, we can vote at all. It's history every Black person that tried to help our cause we killed and white America did see a thing. Where were all of the comments about kkk and other white supremist groups. My people hung from trees while their families watched so that we could vote. I marched with King and I will be Marching 1/20/01.
