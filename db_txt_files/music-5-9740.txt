I'm a diehard Cher fan, and Cher puts alot into her music. This definitley is a good album and will always be. All of her albums are great and I feel that you have to be a true Cher fan to understand her. People look at her running half-naked across the stage, but that's not even a smidget of who she really is as a person.
