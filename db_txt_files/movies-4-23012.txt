I've always felt that Spider-Man was a bit too angst-ridden for my tastes. I don't like the fact that the hero has to make sacrifices and that he is at first unsure wheter to jump at the chance to fight for the side of good. However, the rest of the movie is pretty good. The special effects are great, especially in the action sequences. Kirsten Dunst shines as Mary-Jane Watson and Willem Dafoe does make a good villain. The ending of this movie, however, should have been much more optimsitic than it was. More like 3 1/2 stars.
