The workers need to quit burning the pizza. The last three times I have been to the Little Caeser's Pizza on Thornydale in Tucson ,Az. they have burned the pizza. Also, the crazy bread used to have lots of parmesan cheese on them and now they don't. Please fix the problem I have been eating your pizza for about 20 years and I don't want to have to go somewhere else.
