One of the best teams in the NBA. The Lakers are my faviorte team, but if I had to chose a team that's not the Lakers my first pick would be Dallas. They have three All-Stars in Nash, Nowitzki, and Finley. They have a great supporting cast in Van Exel, Najera, LaFrentz, and Johnson. They have a great team. Everyone talks about how deep the Kings are, but the Mavs are much deeper.
