San Juan de sur has a beautiful beach, Granada beautiful old spainard colonial city, right by a big lake. Also the rainforest ziplining was fantastic. Also they have some really good markets, the tourist one may seem better but the only good things there are overpriced jelwery. The city markets are better, they smell really bad but the merchandise is better made and a lot less expensive.
