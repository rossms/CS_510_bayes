One of the greats! Any player who carries his team to two World Championships has got to be considered one of the best to play the game. In his prime, Olajuwon was unstoppable on both ends of the floor. Because of Hakeem's soccer days, he developed a light step and quick feet that left other centers tripping over themselves. Additionally, guards driving the lane had to either alter their shots or be blocked - there was no third option. It's a shame we never got to see a Michael-Hakeem meeting in the finals.
