I've always liked cracker jacks, albeit the toys always sucked even when I was 2. I haven't had it in a long time but I was never the biggest fan of the peanut part, I was always in it for the caramel corn. I like the sweet taste of it but always found it a bit too soft, it can't hold up to fresh product like the caramel corn being made on the spot at places such as Kernels for example but cracker jack's is a good enough substitute
