I expected this to be a fast-paced movie with lots of action, and I wasn't disappointed. I saw it in a state-of-the art movie theater with an amazing sound system, so when the depth charges exploded, my gut shook and the floor rattled. This isn't going to win an Oscar for best picture, but it did a good job of entertaining me for two hours.
