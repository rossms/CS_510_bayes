Almost a four. If you are willing to go with the plot, this is a cute movie. Jack Black needs to earn some money quick and at the same time is trying to form a new band. He pretends to be his roomate who is a substitute teacher. It turns out some of the kids he is teaching are good musicians. since he cannot teach he gets the kids to start up a band during class. at the end they end up competing in a battle of the bands. pretty unlikely movie. I read the kids really playing the instruments which is nice. A better movie than I thought it would be.
