Have to give my 5 cents here even though it's already been said over and over that this is one of the greatest videos. Take on Me was not only a great song but had a video that carried the energy of the song all the way through it. It had an innovative storyline about a guy stuck in the comic book world trying to cross to the other side (reality). The mirror scene where they see each other as real but are cartoons on the outside is just an example of why this video is one of the greatest out there.
