I dip Timberwolf Natural mostly. It leaves a nice feeling in my lip. I hate Grizzly. It cuts my mouth all to hell. Timberwolf is just pennys more expensive, and it gives you a nice raw feelings after a few dips of Timberwolf Natural Long cut. I can practically swollow it. Peach is a new Timberwolf product I enjoy. With the exception Of Natural and Peach, Timberwolf mint, wintergreen, and straight all make me want to puke like a pregnant teenagers on prom night. Skoal and copenhagen bust up my wallet real bad, but there is always room for a little wolf.
