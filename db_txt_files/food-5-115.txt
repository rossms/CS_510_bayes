Mini-wheats are a very versatile cereal. Whether soggy, dry, or semi moist after dropping them in milk, they taste good. Partly wholesome, partly sweet without being excessive, they leave you full for longer than other cereals. I've been eating them almost every night before going to sleep for almost 10 years (they're a fun cruncy snack.)
