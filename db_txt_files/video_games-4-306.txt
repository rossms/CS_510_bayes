Lucasfilm can do no wrong. As with all their products, quality is the primary objective. After proving itself a competent adventure game producer- the success of the Monkey Island series as well as Sam Max, they have begun a more challenging role in the marketplace- 3D. Grim Fandango has a 3rd person, alone in the dark feel with all the humor we have come to expect. Plot might be a little too linear for adept adventurers.
