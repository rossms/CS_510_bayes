I think Vince Carter is a outstanding player. I live in Toronto and I watch every raptors game. Everybody put him down because He was injuried for the past few years, but he didn't really bother what everybody else thought of him, he continued to play hard, I mean that shows some character. It's really bad that such a good player is on a slow team. I couldn't believe how many times he saved the Raptors from losing. With his acrobatic moves, skills and good sportsmanship, he will get the MVP award one day.
