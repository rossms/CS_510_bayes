You gotta give it to him: The man has the courage of his convictions. Within his first week as Mayor, he stood up in front of the chamber of commerce and said he'd need to raise taxes to take care of the City's most vulnerable (e.g., children and the elderly). He started marrying gay couples - at the expense of his own political future - because it was the right thing to do. He visits crime scenes in an effort to be hands-on in solving the City's low violent crime conviction rate. You may not like his policies, but you simply have to admire his conviction, dedication, and effort.
