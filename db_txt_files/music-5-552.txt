U2 is one of the most solid, talented, long lasting bands around at the moment. They've covered political issues (Sunday Bloody Sunday) and mesmerising hits like 'With Or Without You' and 'Beautiful Day'. This band, like David Bowie have learnt how to successfully adapt to the times and manage it wonderfully. I doubt if there is one person in the Western hemisphere who doesn't know any of their songs. That shows brilliance.
