This poor guy. One of the greatest third basemen to ever play the game - he hit for tremendous power, fielded the position better than anyone in his era, led the team to a World Series in 1980, and was not a bad guy off the field - yet he was booed unmercifully, pitilessly, hatefully, by the Philly fans. Why? Because he was emotional. He popped out and struck out a lot. He didn't talk to the press very much. He was soft spoken, almost feminine. In any other city, there would be statues built to this guy - in Philly they would rather cheer for less talented, more blue collar players. How strange.
