I'm from Texas originally, but I don't live there anymore. But when I come back, I always feel at home, and at ease. I'm probably a little biased, but I think people from Texas are friendlier than anywhere else. I take offense when someone says that people from Texas are all ignorant barbeque eating yokels. That's just as stupid and ignorant as saying all black people know how to tap dance.
