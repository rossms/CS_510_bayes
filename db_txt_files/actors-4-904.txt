I LOVE Al Pacino-- I first saw him in the Godfather movies, and then Serpico-- I still have my Al Pacino scrapbook that I started when I was a pre teen. HOWEVER, ever since he won the oscar for Scent of a Woman(the worst- no real plot- movie ever made)his acting(???) has just been shouting!! I would LOVE him to get a role portraying a mute, then his amazing abilities would shine on the screen once again.( stop trying soooo hard, Al)
