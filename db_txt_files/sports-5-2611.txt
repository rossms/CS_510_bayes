Bobby Cox is amazing. He may only have one World Series, but he has 12 straight division titles and is 1 of only 5 managers (ever) to win 1,500 games with one team. He may not do well in the playoffs, but in the regular season, watch out. I hope he can remain with the Braves organization for a long, long time.
