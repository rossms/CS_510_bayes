If his knee was healthy, there wouldn't be anyone able to stop him. His efforts in the playoffs this year were great. That last shot against the T-wolves was a heartbreaker. I just hope it doesn't damper his spirit for next season. He can't think it was his fault, the Kings had tons of opportunities. Webber def. still has it in him to take over games.
