Ive been a Yankee fan all my life, and have season tickets. Been to 4 World Series games, best team in baseball. True, a lot of this success would not have happend without George's wallet, but teams like the Mets, and the Redsocks have spent almost as much, if not more money, and still failed to win. I give credit to teams like the A's and the Angels, who have managed to win without a lot of money. Too bad the A's are losing Tejada, which will take a huge chunk out of their offense.
