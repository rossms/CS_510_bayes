A fantastic game that has its faults, but I wouldn't do the game justice if I gave it less than 5 stars. This game has excellent gameplay and a well done, complex story. Another poster is correct in saying the game is too short, but this is a game you will likely find yourself playing through more than once. The only other bad part of the game is that once in a while the movie scenes will really start to ramble and go wildly off the storyline. That said, this game is not to be missed if you are a PlayStation or PS2 owner.
