The cemetary itself is not great--what is great is the entire Jewish museum in Prague. They have restored 6 synogauges, each now houses a museum explainig a different part of jewish history, customs, etc. We should all be aware of what has happened in the past, and if in Prague, and you miss this, you are only hurting yourself.
