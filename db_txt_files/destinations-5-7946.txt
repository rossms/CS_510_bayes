Fair Park is a wonderful place to take people on a picnic or on a field trip. The've got lots of clean ponds with ducks, and they have stachues of dinosaurs, in fact a museam about a certain dinosaur too. They open up their extremly large and scary ferris wheel on the weekends I belive, and they have a theater there, both a movie and a musical/play type. It's a great place to go.
