Glad they won this year. A powerful club in the early days of the A.L. Technically the oldest club in that circuit. Fell on hard times after throwing the 1919 season, and with the exception of the '59 season, the '83 season, and a few years in the 90's, they were often either mediocre or bad, with not a hell of a lot of big names most of the time, and always overshadowed not only in the city, but with the public in general by the Cubs until this year.
