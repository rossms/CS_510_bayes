Not surprised that Rudy T resigned. I knew he wouldn't last this long due to his health. ... Anyway, I don't see them making another title run in a long time. Vlade Divac isn't the same center that he used to be. They'd be lucky if Phil Jackson came back, but they oughta hire Flip Saunders as the next coach.
