You folks giving it 5 stars need to get out a little more! Does not belong on this list-- clearly a fast food store. Food edible, breadsticks tasty, portions large. Lacks atmosphere, service, creativity. At best it is simply bad compaed to sit down chains and good compared to fast food joints. Bread sticks are tasty, but whose aren't? Looking for quick Italian, this is the place.
