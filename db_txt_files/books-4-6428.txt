I will admit that this book was rushed out to cash in on the great sales of O'Reilly's previous book, but it still contains a great deal of information that everyone should know. I also know that too many Kool-Aid drinking liberal minded people will never know what they need to and they would rather drink their Kool-Aid and croak with the Jones followers than read O'reilly's books or watch his TV show or listen to his radio broadcasts. Too bad! Go drink up.... the world will be a better place when you're gone.
