One of the most complete Offensive players in the game today. If this man can stay healthy, at least during the season, i see great feats being accomplished under the banner of Albert Pujols. one can speculate than when Barry Bonds and his Steriod riddled body retire, Pujols could be in contention to win the first triple crown in baseball since 1967.
