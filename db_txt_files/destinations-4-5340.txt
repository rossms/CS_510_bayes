I live here, in the NE part of the state, and I have to say, I don't mind it at all. I think we have a very beautiful state rich in history and culture. The people here are very nice (I'M NICE!!! SO DON'T SAY PENNSYLVANIANS AREN'T NICE!). The biggest problem has to be roadwork. PENNDOT people are dumb...you will have problems driving through, but otherwise enjoy PA!!!
