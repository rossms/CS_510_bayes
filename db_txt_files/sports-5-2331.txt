Oh, yes. Despite the goofy logo, my beloved Indians are still one of the classiest teams in baseball. Jim Thome is one of the greatest hitters I have ever had the pleasure of watching. He's currently the number-one all-time Indian for HRs and at-bats, if I'm not mistaken. But if I am. . .so what! I love my Indians and ONE of these days I might witness a World Series victory parade down Euclid Avenue!
