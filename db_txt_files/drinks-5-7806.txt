I am a relative novice when it comes to bourbon but I must admit I thouroughly enjoy Blanton's. I first experienced Blanton's as an after dinner drink. It was a nice finish to a wonderful meal. Poured over a couple of ice cubes it is smooth and has several layers of flavor. Comparing the price of Blanton's to other bourbons it is on the more expensive side but I think it is money well spent. After a long streesful day, a glass of Blanton's and a compfortable chair is just what the doctor ordered.
