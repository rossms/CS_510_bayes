I have been drinking this one for quite a while now, thanks to Trader Joe's out here on the west coast. Heavy on the alcohol at over 7%, it just doesn't taste that strong when it goes down. Mind you, the strength is there, it is just that this ale just doesn't have the aftertaste that other strong ales do. The malt definitely overpowers the hops. And at 7+%, that just is not a bad thing. And at $3.99 a six pack, the price is right too.
