Try buying a printer there...by the time you need to buy a new ink cartridge for it, lo behold, they don't sell that model or its cartridge anymore. The same principle applies to so much of what they sell - it becomes obsolete in the twinkling of an eye. We've got a Super Center here, with about 30 lanes. You're lucky if more than 5 of them are open. But I did luck out the other day. I visited the bathroom and there was NOT a sign on the door saying it was closed for cleaning.
