to everybody that says that banana republic is too expensive... companies have target markets. this particular company's targeted segment of the population is not teenagers or teeny boppers (i'm not saying that they don't want teenagers to shop there, they just aren't focused on them). it is for a slightly older, higher class of individuals. if you can't afford to shop at banana republic then simply don't shop there.
