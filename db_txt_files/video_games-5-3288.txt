12/9/04: So far, where I'm at, it has the best story that I've ever experienced. It truly is the best no matter if it is pixelated. I wished that this game was on GameCube, but it is, nonetheless, a gripping and memorable game. I cannot wait to see the end... >update: It is a great one ot see as I finally finished the American version. My bad for spoiling the ending, but you will be a little puzzled in a good way if there will be an ending. All questions will be answered when the movie comes out. A must have for anyone owning any version of the PS consoles.
