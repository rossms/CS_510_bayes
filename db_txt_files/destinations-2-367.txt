The mountains are beautiful. There are three basic classes of people that live there: Hippies, Yuppies, and Chinese people. Although they produce the most marijuana in Canada, it is far from the best. Manitoba weed is the most potent in the country, though I guess American tourists wouldn't know the difference, and B.C. residents are so smugly sure of themselves that they wouldn't bother to try any other regional variants before proclaiming theirs as the best. But there is more to life than marijuana, and scenery, which is why B.C. gets a 2 out of 5.
