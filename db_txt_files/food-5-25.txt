Blue Bell is sold mainly in the Texas and possibly Oklahoma, Louisiana, Arkansas, and New Mexico (not sure). Bottom line is that it is the closest to homemade I have ever tasted. Ice cream is my weakness, and I have tried many brands. Honestly, Blue Bell is better than B&J's, H-D, Dryer's, and Breyer's. You have to try it to believe me, and whenever you are in Texas take a trip to the grocery store and buy a gallon of Blue Bell (so many flavors, but their staple is Homemade Vanilla Ice Cream). You'll thank me later.
