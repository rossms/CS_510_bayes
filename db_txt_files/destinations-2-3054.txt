I'm rating this as a tourist destination. Even that's not good. Alright, San Fran is a nice place to visit, lots of cool things to do. However, having lived in a far-left city for four years, I know it's not a nice town. Reading other reviews on here helped too. It's a shame a town known for gold mining and hard luck tough guys has morphed into the city it is today. If you do visit anyway, visit the Harbor Road, or whatever it's called, and have breakfast at Sears Restaurant. It's by the Wyndam, I believe. You won't be disappointed.
