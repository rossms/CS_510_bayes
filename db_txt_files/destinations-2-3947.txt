As most commenters have said, Miami is a fun place to visit, beautiful weather, hot yes, but I love hot weather, only city in the mainland USA that has a tropical feel. Beaches are mediocre, go to the Gulf Coast of Florida for nice beaches. Agreed, would definately not want to live there, unless I was extremely wealthy and able to live in one of the many beautiful gated suburbs. Otherwise you'll live in some crime-ridden section of the city. There is no way I'd raise my kids here.
