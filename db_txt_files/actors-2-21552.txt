Ick! Talk about over-rated! Brandy is a cute young lady with slim acting/moosical talents. She is the female version of Hollywood's Acceptible Black Entertainer with Marginal Talents , mooch like Will Smith is the male version. I am sick of entertainment buy/for/with and including teenagers. Way over-hyped. :=8/
