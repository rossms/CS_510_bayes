The 89-92 models were the best with the four-cylendar turbo engine option. It is very well at handling and cornering due to the variable suspension control available. It is also really quick with a 2.2L turbo. It will definetly put you in your seat. It is a very good car to have and very fun to drive! (The`92 is by far the best probe made.)
