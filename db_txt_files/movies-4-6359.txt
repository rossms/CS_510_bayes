I don't like saying this because I really like the movie AND Brando, but I think that One The Waterfront is a tad overrated. It probably deserves 5 stars, but I'm giving it 4, cause it's good. Not Great! but good. The American Film Institure put it as #8 in their top 100 list. I would rather put It's A Wonderful Life if they want a classic. I would have On The Waterfront in the top 100 though, just not top 10 or 20. Brando though reinvented acting, with a truly brilliant performance with passion and sadness. The music is beautiful as well.
