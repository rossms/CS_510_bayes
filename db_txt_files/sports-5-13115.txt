My favorite college football team, ever since I attended my first game in 1976. I've been to games at 4 major universities, and there is no greater feeling than what you find in Stillwater, Oklahoma. I've also been able to watch some of their finest running backs: Thurman Thomas, Ernest Anderson, Barry Sanders, and my favorite, Terry Miller. You never know from one season to the next whether they'll have a good year, but OSU represents college football at its best.
