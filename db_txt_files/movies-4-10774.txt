This movie, as far as comedy goes, was hilarious! I thought Brendon Frasier was pretty good in it. He looks really funny as a Brazilian! Didn't even look like him at all. Elizabeth Hurley is actually pretty good in it too. It isn't Oscar material, but it is a good movie to watch if you are looking for something to do besides the dishes.
