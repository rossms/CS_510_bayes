My husband is addicted to orville's microwave 94%fat free popcorn. He consumes at least 20 regular sized bags a week. No exageration! However, I've been dissappointed recently in the product. In the past month we have run into 17 bags of popcorn that have not popped and had to be disguarded. There is no way of knowing if the product is defective at the time of purchase. This is not a cheap product to use. This problem has cost our household too much money. We will continue to use your popcorn but, we would appreciate a better quality of popcorn everytime we pop.
