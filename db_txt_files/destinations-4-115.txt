I had a wonderful time there. The people were very kind, there was always something to do, and everything is efficient and clean. Although expensive, the transportation system is amazing. Living my life in NYC, I never thought the train system could be beaten, but Tokyo beats it by far. On the down side, Tokyo is expensive. Tokyo also suffers from being very expansive and non-grid city planning (in these respects its alot like LA). However, for a visit, the positive outwieghs the vices drastically. I recommend going to Shibuya, Shinjuku, Ikebukuro, Harajuku, Asakusa, Akihabara, and Odaiba
