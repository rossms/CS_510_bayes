Goodnight Moon is one of the loveliest books I have ever read. It's a comforting treatment of relationships and space. I have seven children ages three through twenty-six. My 3, 4, 8, 10, and 15 year-olds have all enjoyed a bedtime story of Goodnight Moon. It is a carefully and well written book. The pictures are lovely. It conveys a sense of peace and well being to children in this hurried world.
