It was almost great, but I came up short of a heart attack...Extremely suspenseful...Michelle P. did an excellent job and it was good to see Harrison as something other than the hero! Like the Sixth Sense you were seeing dead people and I came out of my seat more than once. Good thing my wife was able to calm my nerves with some soothing Junior Mints ...Go see it soon.
