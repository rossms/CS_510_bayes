It really depends on who makes it for you how good it will be! The first time I got one was in Boston (right near the Prudential Center) and it was SOOO good! The perfect mix of white chocolate and coffee! But I've gotten them in other areas, too, and they just weren't as good...too much of the white chocolate flavoring was used, and it was way too sugary sweet.
