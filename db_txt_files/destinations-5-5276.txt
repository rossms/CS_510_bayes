The five stars are for San Francisco-Bay Area and Santa Barbara. If you want to find peace of mind and beautiful scenery, just skip LA and go to SF. I find LA very stressful and boring. There's not much to see in LA. But, if you're looking for nightlife fun, then i suggest you go to LA. Be prepared to drive in LA though.. it's madness!!
