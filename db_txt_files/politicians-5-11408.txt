Say what you want about him, his politics and personall history, but just know that he is one of the hardest working members of the Senate. All politics aside, he takes his job very seriously and does what he thinks is best for his consituents. Just being a Kennedy is the only reason some people seem to need to put him down, but that is unfair. Had he been born a Jones or Smith, he would be regaurded as a hard-working, caring politician.
