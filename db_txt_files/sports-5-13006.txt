This team has done nothing but consistently improve in the last few years. They went from losing every game in a season to most likely winning all of this season't games. Add in a couple Bowl games, a great sophomore QB, a Heisman contender and the 2nd best defence in the country and you have a football team that is ready to stand up and be noticed. The world better get ready for the Horned Frogs.
