A good quality DARK rum, a brand name cola and a squeeze of lime can make a pretty tasty drink. Called a Cuba Libre in some parts of the world, its a little on the sweet side for my taste, but pleasant on a hot day. But if you make it with cheap white rum and store brand cola, it tastes like paint thinner.
