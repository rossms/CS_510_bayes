Given that I'm not a teenager, I'm probably not anywhere near the target market for Cheetos, but I still love these things. I generally don't buy them very often, but anytime I'm on a road trip I always pick up a bag during pit stops. I'm not exactly sure what the hell they are, but they taste great. And there's something oddly endearing about the orange mess on your hands and lips after you're done eating a bag.
