The acting was very good. Sissy Spacek deserves the Oscar she will probably get, and Marisa Tomei and Tom Wilkinson were close. But, when I go to the movies, I like to be entertained. This movie is not entertaining. Disturbing, Depressing, but not entertaining. I left the movie wanting to be a little sick. 2 stars
