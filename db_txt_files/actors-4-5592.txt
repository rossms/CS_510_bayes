Val Kilmer is a very good actor who unfortunately, as someone else pointed out, does not carefully consider the roles that he undertakes. Only a few films in his career have been memoriable performances. The Saint , Tombstone , Thunderheart and Top Gun are among his best. At First Sight was also a real pleaser as well. However, he did not make a very good Batman and his talent is sadly wasted on second rate films.
