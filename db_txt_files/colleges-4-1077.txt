If I were to go Ivy League, it just might be Cornell. A very good school that is the largest of the Ivies. It has some excellent departments like Architecture, Engineering and Hotel Management. Laugh maybe, but Cornell grads work the finest restaurants and prepare the best meals you'll ever eat. Being close to NYC allows for a strong network in place in that area and on the East Coast. Ithaca isnt the worst place to spend four years of college as well.
