I never got the chance to finish ff9, but I almost did, and was very impressed. The story is weaker than FF7, but stronger than FF8. The characters could use a little work, however. The graphics are amazing, and the adventure is very worthwhile. I would have liked to see more character development, and at times it seemed there was no impetus to continue--that is, the characters just seemed to be wandering without reason. But, minor complaints. All in all, a good game.
