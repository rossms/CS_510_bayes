If you can only visit one place while in London-this is IT. Incredibly vast and full of fascinating displays.It isn't humanly possible to see it all in one day.It's free,and much more entertaining and informative than just about any other attraction you might pay to see.Highly recommended.There is truly something for everyone here!
