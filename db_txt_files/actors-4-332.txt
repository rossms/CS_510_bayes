Very good looking guy as a young man, but only so-so too often as an actor. A bit too stiff a good deal of the time, and he often does not project much intelligence, but he had a presence and a good voice. Best role was probably in Sunset Boulevard, was good in Born Yesterday, The Wild Bunch, and Picnic but his professional profile suffers somewhat in that he was not too discriminating in his choice of roles, so he ended up in quite a few turkeys.
