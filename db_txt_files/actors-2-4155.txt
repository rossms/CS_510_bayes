I wrote to laurence years ago about my sister that was dying from cancer. I ask him if he would call her collect because see was a true fan. A small price to pay for a smile on someone face. I guess he was to busy. We have cross each other path twice in life and looking forward to our next meeting. I can't rate the actor without rating the man.
