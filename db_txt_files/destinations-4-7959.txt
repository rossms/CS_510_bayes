A shameless tourist trap, Billy Bob's is probabably the largest bar that you will ever see. On the premises there is a rodeo, an arcade, 20 or so odd pool tables, a giant dance floor, and a couple of snack bars. Though it's probably not a place that I would hang out in if I lived in Dallas, it is kind of a fun tourist destination. You get to see a lot of folks walking around in cowboy hats, see some bull-riding, and drink a couple of Shiner Bocks. It's worth a look.
