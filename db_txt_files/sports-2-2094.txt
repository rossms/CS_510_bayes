I'm a Cardinals fan and they are our new rival I guess after two years of back to back NLCS hard competition. And they win at home alot (did Enron spend all their money on naming this stadium and making it perfect home field condition and then lay off all their workers? it g ot renamed to Minute Maid Park by the way). How could Brad Lidge pitch no home runs in the regular season and 3 doing the post season. Yes they are one of my two least favorite teams them and the Yankees, but i'll give them two stars because rivalry is fun.
