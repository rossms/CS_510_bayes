Best kept secret in Vegas, we walked through it and their was hardly any one there. The rides were not that great and it was not cheap to ride any thing. Vegas says its for families but who are they kidding. You have to go all the way through the casino to get to the attraction and it was not advertised. We actually stumbled across it. Update I guess I hit the nail on the head when I first post this rating. Its long gone.
