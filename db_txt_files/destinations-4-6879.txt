I think the people of Alabama are a great group, and even the country is beautiful. But the cities in this state really have way too much pollution for their size, and if it continues it could cause problems later on. But like I said before, like all southern states, the food is wonderful, and so is the heritage. You can almost feel and taste the historical significance of this place. It is awesome.
