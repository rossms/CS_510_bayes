Have owned three nissan trucks and they have all been excellent trucks. A 01 frontier is a good looking truck that stands above all domestic compacts as far as looks and longevity. If you don't believe it's a good truck just look at any truck trader and look all those rangers and s-10 for sale the look at the nissan section not many nissan owners selling the beloved trucks.
