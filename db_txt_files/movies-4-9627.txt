No this film is not Casablanca, but it is down right hilarious. Jim Carrey we know can do comedy, but the real surprise is Jeff Daniels he is excellent and extremely funny. It is that type of humor that has you busting a gut with laughter because of it's sheer stupidity but because of The Farrelly brothers it's almost sheer genius.
