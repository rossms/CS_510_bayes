Oh how I love J. Crew! I look forward each month to the day I get the new catalog in the mail. I prefer the catalog to the actual store, the store rarely carries all that I have wanted from the catalog. The clothes are always high quality, and I have never been dissapointed by anything that I have ordered from the catalog. And also they always have the cutest, best fitting swimsuits. Oh I could just go on forever about how I love J. Crew!
