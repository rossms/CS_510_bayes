I am very disappointed in one of our Missouri leaders when I watched Al Gore's phone party with Dick Gephardt on 11/27/00. If Dick knew what was best for the Democratic party, he would tell Al Gore that it is time to throw in the towel. Instead he choses to be Al Gore's puppet . I thought that Dick Gephardt was a leader --- turns out that he can be manipulated if the price is right .
