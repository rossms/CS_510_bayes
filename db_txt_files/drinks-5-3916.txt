Sorry we seem to have some...well lets just say some less than manly drinkers in here. The tabasco actually smoothes the Tequila and is a great shot. A female turned me onto it in Centennial, WY..just outside Laramie. I suggest the other reviewers stay clear of that locale. Many tough cowboys and ranchers.
