The Counting Crows third album continues to show the promise they have of sticking to country roots with some hard rock thrown in. Among my favorite tracks are, Hanging Around, a celebration of being a lazy person, and Mrs. Potter, a somewhat lonsome, reflective song. For those that don't know, there is a hidden track that is phenomenal. A really kick ass twangy rock song.
