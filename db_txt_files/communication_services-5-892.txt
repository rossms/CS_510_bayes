My wife and I switched to STi mobile from a Verizon Plan. We are saving over $20 per month and don't have to ever worry about a contract again. We got two new LG 5225 Color Flip Phones for free after rebate. Not bad. We are surprised how good it is working out. If you search some other forums on the net regarding STi Mobile, they are getting over all high marks. If you order from cheapphonecards.com, they have the phones on sale and cheaper than directly from STi.
