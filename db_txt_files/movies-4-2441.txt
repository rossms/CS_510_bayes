Unfortunately, Tony Scott wasn't able to bring out the full potential of Shane Black's script. However, there are pleasures to be had, particularly Samuel Jackson's performance, which is very amusing. Jackson seems to improve just about any movie he's in, especially when he's paired with white bread actors like Geena Davis or Bruce Willis.
