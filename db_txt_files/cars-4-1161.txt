The competition is closing in on this Bavarian Bad Boy. While I'm not crazy about the new Bimmers styling, there is no denying the capabilities of this legendary series. The wonderful dynamics of the chassis , and the excellent driving ergonomics ie; pedal placement, laterally suportive seats, and the perfect action of the various 5-6 speed transmissions, give the 3 series its well earned reputation as being the Ultimate Driving Machine. 5 stars for the alien beast known as the M3!
