Is it possible for this joker to make a GOOD movie? His movies are entertaining but definetly lacking in the believability department. I can suspend my disbelief for two guys to switch faces, but for them to go through all the poo they go through and still come out ready to fight in the finale? Come on Woo! But, as long as the public eats this drivel up, the more he'll make. Give the people what they want. This man knows what they want.
