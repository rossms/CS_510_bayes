I think this artist deserved to win Best New Artist from the 2000 Grammy Awards. I love her album because I can dance to it when I am happy and I can sing when I feel like being mellow. The song I enjoy the most is, What A Girl Wants , because my boyfriend fits the description of that song. He makes me feel good inside and gives me exactly what I want - love!
