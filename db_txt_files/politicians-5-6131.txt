Truly a decent man who I have the privledge of meeting. He will make a wonderful Attorney General. His record is excellent despite the smear campaigns going on---he is no racist! He himself nominated black judges in Missouri and voted for 90% of blacks that came before the Senate. Stop the smear campaign and let the President-Elect have his picks.
