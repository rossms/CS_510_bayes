so sweet that they sometimes make your teeth hurt - So dense - so rich -so amazingly good! Snickers, while a bit overly sweet (like a lot of other candy bars and cakes are as well however) can really hit the spot. Also, they're density makes them the perfect choice for a quick boost and they really manage to fill you up. Sometimes I don't feel like having the crunchiness of the nuts but no worries, Mars company has the mars bar (named so in canada) and the exact same bar named Milky Way in the states. Both are snickers minus the nuts and all of them are decadent goodness
