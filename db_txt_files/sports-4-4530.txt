Kind of fell into a good situation with the players he has at U of I. However, it's hard to argue with a record of 29-1, with that one loss being on a chance three-pointer in front of a very hostile Ohio State crowd. Also, notice what happened to Purdue when he left and where So. Illinois went when he was their coach.
