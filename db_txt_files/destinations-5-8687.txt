Im a junior in High School and I LOVE chewing, I got started because cigarettes stunk up my room too much, So far I've tried, Copenhagen Pouches, Copenhagen Black, Grizzly Natural, Grizzly Mint, Grizzly Wintergreen, Skoal Mint, Apple, and Peach, and also Kodiak. If I feel like getting satisfyed quickly, I'd go Grizzly wintergreen, if I want flavor, Id go apple or peach. If you want a buzz Kodiak, over anything But when it comes to Mint or Wintergreen Id definately go with Grizzly, just because its cheaper and still does the job, but you just cant beat the taste of Peach Skoal...
