I spent 2 years of college in New Hampshire at New England College (Henniker). Beautiful scenery and the stress level is so low you may be comotose. Lake Winapasaukee (spelling?) is breathtaking and the Connotook River (sp) in Henniker was equally as good. Live Free or Die is an appropriate motto. You have to like the outdoors and be agrarian to like the state. I have not been back since the early 90's, but will be back some fall.
