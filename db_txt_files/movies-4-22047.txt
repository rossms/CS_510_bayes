 Aliens is a really well-done sequel something you definitely don t see very often. And if you ve seen the third movie in this series, you know how easy it was to make a bad Alien movie. So you have to give James Cameron credit for directing one of the few sequels that might actually be better than the original (along with Godfather 2 maybe?). Inherently Aliens lacks the originality of Alien, but the action is better, it manages to add in some humor, and it does a good job of building on many of the same issues introduced by the first movie.
