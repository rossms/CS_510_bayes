I have just bought a 91' Lexus Soarer 2.5 GT-T (upgraded version!) - WOW!!!!! my last car was a R reg Scorpio Cosworth which i thought (at the time!) was 'fast!' but after trading the car in for an older model (by 8 years!) i now realise the true meaning of 'speed!!' 0-60 in 4.5 secs - again - WOW!!!
