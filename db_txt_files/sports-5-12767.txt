This team was absolutely awesome last year. Especially towards the end of the season. They were a definite powerhouse. I don't think they would have had any trouble beating Ohio State or Miami in a championship game last year if they played the kind of game they were capable of. The spanking they gave Arkansas in the SEC championship game was almost too embarrassing to watch. I've never really been a Georgia fan, but their talent last season can't be ignored.
