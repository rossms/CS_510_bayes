Nevermind is a good album. Nothing more. The hype piled upon it by MTV and the rest of the corporate music biz was very unwarranted. They just used these guys to push a new marketing wave. The fact that it is now considered a classic shows how well they marketed it. People go on about how they saved us from hair metal? Gimme a break. Nirvana was not too far removed from that genre. The only difference was that they wore flannel. They started a new fashion trend that was no more real than Poison. Kurt Cobain himself likened Nirvana to a 90's version of Cheap Trick. Give me the Replacements any day.
