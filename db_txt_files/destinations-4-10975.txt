Very good 'old school' amusement park. I remember driving through the town to get to the park and it literally smells like Hershey;s chocoalte the enitre drive through town. Some great old wooden roller coaster there - I think it is called the Comet. That thing really throws you around. Other good coasters and a wide array of rides to have fun on and there is the candy factory tour which is great when you are a kid.
