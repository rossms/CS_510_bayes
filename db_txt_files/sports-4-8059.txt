Iverson is a great player. He is also the fastest basketball player I have ever seen. He is also very immature, running around taking pot shots at gays, littering his body with tatoos. Philly won't win a championship with him because of his ego. If he doesnt shoot 35 times in a game he's upset win or lose. Philly can have him, he's their problem now.
