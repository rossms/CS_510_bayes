Bought a 1999 Polaris SLTX this march and totally love it. It has a 1051 cc ,125hp engine and it shows it's power on the water. We've pulled a 3 seater sea-doo tube behind it and we had to be a bit carefully because it doesn't slow the machine down at all and you can easily flip someone out . Heard some bad things about Polaris machines lately and would like to know why it seems to have a bit of a bad reputation??? Thanks!
