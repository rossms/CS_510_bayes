Kids should really like this one, especially when the mean teacher and parents get what's coming to them. I enjoyed it for the most part, mainly because the little girl is so appealing, and real-life husband and wife Danny Devito and Rhea Perlman are a hoot to watch as the parents. You'll probably be rolling your eyes at some scenes, mainly because they are very unrealistic, but it should keep the kids quiet for an hour and a half.
