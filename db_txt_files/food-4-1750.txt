Mike and Ikes are a dentist's dream come true... not only do they come in four different flavors of sugar (red, orange, yellow, and green) but they stick to your teeth like crazy glue and coat your tongue with that distinct candy film. What's not to love? I mean really, if you're craving something that is sweet and chewy --grab a box of Mike and Ikes...and maybe a toothbrush.
