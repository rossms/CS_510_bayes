This was my first James Patterson book, and it was entertaining. Definitely not great writing, but the story was well thought out. The dialogue of its characters was weak in my opinion, especially when writing for young adults and women. I assume that Patterson is just cranking out novels to make money at this point in his career, and isn't too concerned with the page to page quality.
