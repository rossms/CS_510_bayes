oh man, you just cannot beat graeters. it's the best there ever was. the ice cream is so good and creamy. so many unique flavors, plus a special each month. there are also many many flavors of sorbet, as well as old fashion sodas and other treats. plus, you can get great cakes or a wide variety of chocolates and candies. the hyde park one is definetly the best, followed by clifton.
