I agree with bluetarbaby. I think it's obvious. As far as centerfielders go, there is truly no discussion. Andruw saves 2 runs a game and is the sole reason for Atlantas low era. Edmunds is good, but when he makes a web gem, Druw would have caught it effortlessly. If Druw reacted to the ball like Edmunds, he would have 5 web gems a night! Hell, Andruw is chasing it down before the batter even swings... ..........LITERALLY! Watch sometime!
