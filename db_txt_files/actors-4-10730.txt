I have not seen her in too many movies yet. She has shown some real potential though. I like that she does not play your typical teenager roles. that is a wise move. she will not be type cast then. I have read that her two movies this year one of them being Girl with a Pearl Earring she has been getting great reviews. I would be willing to try out some of her movies.
