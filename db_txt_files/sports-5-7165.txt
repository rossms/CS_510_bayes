Simply the best athlete in any sport ever! Always performed at a SUPERHUMAN level every night. He combined tremendous physical AND mental strength to lead the Bulls to six world championships. His amazing talent was like something out of Marvel Comics! Gave millions of fans endlesss thrills and I am so glad he's coming back! Thanks, MJ!
