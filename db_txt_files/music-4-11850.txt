This album is really cool. I was starting not to like Blink-182 when the All The Small Things single was released. It completely turned them into a pop group, but now i think they are recovering. Most people reguard them as an Alt-Punk-Rock band now, which is cool. And I really like how they did a live album, it kind of brings them back some of their punk credibility. Plus they sound incredible live, the jokes between songs are hilarious, and the new song Man Overboard is awesome.
