I have friends who live in Alaska who absolutely love it. They always talk about how it's not as cold as everyone thinks. Yea, right, when I see the weather in the newspaper and the high in July is like 50 degrees. Sorry, I know Alaska is beautiful and I'd love to visit, but I like warm weather and enjoying outdoor activities for more than just 2 months a year.
