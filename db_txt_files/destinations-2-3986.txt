Orlando is a great place to visit on vacation, but do not ever move there. It then becomes (B)Orlando. Outside of the temem parks there is nothing to do. The traffic is horrible, the weather in summer is miserable. It is completely lacking any cultural attractions unless you count karaoke bars. Forget live music or jazz clubs. Very few touring shows play in Borlando, which is good becuase there are no good concert venues. All in all a miserable city with very poor job prospects except for the hospitality sector.
