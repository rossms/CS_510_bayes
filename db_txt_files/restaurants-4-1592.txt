I like KFC even though I don't go there too often. The best thing on thier menu are those little chocolate cakes. The popcorn chicken was good, but the quantity was too small. Thier main meals are good. I usually just order a box of chicken or something like that, the potatoes and other little offspring foods arent really that appealing. Still, its the best place to get delicious chicken on the run.
