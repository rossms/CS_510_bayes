Last player to hit .400, a record tht looks like it will never be broken. It's amazing that a man can fail 6 out of ten plate appearances and still be considered great. I just wonder how he would have fared facing a Randy Johnson Fastball, or a Nolan Ryan pitch. What makes his record even more remarkable is that his career was bifurcated by the Korean War. Being draft back into the army to fight in Korea would have ended a lot of players careers, but Ted came back stonger than ever.
