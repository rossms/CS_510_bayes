University of Arizona is a great school. They have a great business school. It is the desert but you also have Mt. Lemon that offers cooler weather and great hiking. Mexico is an easy 45 min. drive. Phoenix is only an hour away if you need the big city. There is a little of everything at the U of A. It is a fun party school too.
