The book is funny, but the strange part is that a lot of it is true...I think. Conspiracy theory as humor and a learning tool. But at times it seemed as if Mr. Belzer started believing in some of the myths he was helping to create. I liked the book, but I expected more. Maybe I will wait for the next book, or just go watch the X-Files again.
