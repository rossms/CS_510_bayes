I've never seen so much roadkill in my life! Driving down the highway, one sees Bambi's as far as the eye can see. Unfortunately, that's the only scenery in W. Virginia. BORING! John Denver must have been high when he wrote Country Road . I don't know anyone who would want to be taken home to this state! Wasn't Deliverance filmed there?
