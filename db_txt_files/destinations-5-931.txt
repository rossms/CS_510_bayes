If we're rating politics here, Greece is not tops on my list. If we're rating places to live, Greece is wonderful -- I spent 4 memorable years there. If we're rating vacation destinations, Greece is in my top 3 because of food, archaeology, the people, the scenery, the lifestyle, the beaches, the fun.
