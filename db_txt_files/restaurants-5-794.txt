The only "bad experience" I've had with Subway is that every store I was going to was out of the Red Wine Vinegarette dressing except then I found one again! I don't know if they discontinued it for a bit or what but I'm so happy I have it back! My personal favorite is the Veggie Delight on Italian Herbs and Cheese bread with the best dressing, listed above, to compliment it.
