A whiskey sour is my default drink. The bite of the whiskey is offset by the sour mix. Truly, it should be called a whiskey sweet and sour b/c that's what it is. Not good for people with heartburn. Good comfort drink but it will get you hammered quickley. Best with Jameson's Irish Whiskey. If you're ever in Boston, Ambrosia's on Bolsten St makes a killer drink.
