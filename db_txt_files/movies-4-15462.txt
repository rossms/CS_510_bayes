This movie was very up down. I cared so much about the people at St. Cloud's orphanage, especially those kids (which will BREAK your heart), and not so much about the people Homer encountered at the apple farm, especially Candy -- blah. Erykah Bahdu's acting was a nice surprise, but those orphans steal the show, in my opinion!
