Maybe it is just the area I live in. Whatever it is Comcast provides good service at a decent cost. There are 2 other cable providers in my area in addition to the satellite option. Mediacom is one. Their prices are comparable but the selection is much less. It has improved greatly since Mediacom first arrived in this area but does not match what Comcast offers. Cox communications has similar pricing as well with almost the same selection and service. Having always been satisfied with Comcast I never changed. The service could be better but it is the best in my area and I have had no problems with them.
