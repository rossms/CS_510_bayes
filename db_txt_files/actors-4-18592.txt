 One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest is on my list of top-five movies of all time, which earns Forman at least four stars. I also thought The People vs. Larry Flynt was excellent. But Forman hasn't compiled a large enough body of work to be included in the five-star category with the likes of Hitchcock and Spielberg. A few more great movies will take this guy to the next level.
