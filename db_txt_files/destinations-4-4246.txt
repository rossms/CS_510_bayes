Nightlife is wild and the women are beautiful. Can't really comment on the cultural scene. Housing is very affordable, many great spots to live. Four typically solid sports teams. Sort of a concrete jungle, no public transportation for kind of a sprawl of a city. Summers are hot and dry, but lakes are nearby.
