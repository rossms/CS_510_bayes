Great candy, it makes me remember one of the reasons I used to love going to visit my grandparents whe I was a kid. they always gad a jar of M Ms that my sister and I pretty much had free access to that jar. I liked the light brown colored one, and I am not sure I fully support taking those away for the new red and blue ones.
