I like some of the movies that Whoopi has been in. She was great as the con artist who could hear ghosts in ghost. She was good in The Color Purple doing a dramatic role. and i liked her in the movie Sister Act. unfortunately, she has been in some movies that had awful plots. Some of her roles have been good.
