Haley was completely, 100%, no-doubt-about-it, ROBBED of the Oscar he deserved for his role in "The Sixth Sense". No other child actor could've pulled off that performance and his role was THE pivotal role that made the movie work. I like Bruce but like Steven Segal, Bruce has pretty much one character.
