Here's the deal. When you see the distence between an area you're in there's ALWAYS traffic. Expect to see 5 highway accidents daily; people here cannot drive people two talk to themselves, use the sidewalk as a public bathroom, stoners on the busses who offer weed to underaged kids (happened to me)
