These are perfect for beginners or for somebody who is on-the-go and they just want a quick smoke. They are, however, too weak for a novice or seasoned veteran smoker. I acctually perfer the taste of those sweet, sweet Marlboro full flavor 100's. Good God those things are good. A beginner smoker should move onto those when they are a good six months into smoking. Marlboro Rules!!!
