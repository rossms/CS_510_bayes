My favorite, especially if your trying to watch your weight...but I like diet soda also. Other cereals are too sweet. Good with a banana or strawberries! Or in a trail mix...add some raisens and M&M's, you can get your chocolate fix taken care of and eat something good for you at the same time. Great for toodlers...this is one of the first finger foods I gave my toddlers...always had Cherrios in the diaper bag!
