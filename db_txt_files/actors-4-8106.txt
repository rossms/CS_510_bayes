I liked a lot of the movies Bette Davis did. She was good in All About Eve. And she did a great Job as the cruel abusive jealous sister in Whatever happened to baby Jane?, she seemed to especially be good in witchy {with a capital B} roles. I liked when she was being nasty and talked in this cat like voice. She was always convincing in her roles.She was a classic in her own way.
