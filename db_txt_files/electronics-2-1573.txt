Warning to all!! Keep your $250 in your pocket and briskly walk past the Half Perfect Series. A friend of mine layed down big bucks for this so called industry leader and wasted his money. The high bass and mid bass on these speakers are mediocre and the only redeeming factor is its low bass. Plus, in a week the subwoofers will blow and it takes three months for the warranty to send you new one.
