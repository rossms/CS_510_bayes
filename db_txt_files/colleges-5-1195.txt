As a sophomore at Yale, I can honestly say that Yale is an amazing school! Academically it is one of the best schools in the country. Additionally, the student body is friendly, diverse, and brilliant! I would highly recommend Yale to any student who is looking to attend an amazing, challengingcollege. Also, don't believe everything that is said about New Haven. New Haven has lots of great restaurants, and it is only about 90 minutes away from NYC!
