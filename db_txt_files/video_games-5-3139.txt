This game is evrything a car game lover could want. It has great graphics - though not as good as GT4, you got to tune up your own car, and the feel of speed is completely realistic. Though unfortunately the story needs more and once you have completed career mode you can only do quick races and 2 player game, it is still a great game and i would recommend it to anyone.
