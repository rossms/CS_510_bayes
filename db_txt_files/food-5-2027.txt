I am a chocolate conoisseur, and the Russell Stover 'Mint Dream' is absolutely DELICIOUS! It is a whipped mint fluffy creamy center dipped and covered in milk chocolate, and is TO DIE FOR good!!! You can even order cases of the stuff directly from the manufacturer, which is what I do. One of my favorite, all-time candy bars!
