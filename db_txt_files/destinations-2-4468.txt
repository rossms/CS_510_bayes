Hotlanta blows - it's a soulless city that admittedly would likely be more charming had it not burned down many years ago. Perhaps it should've stayed burnt. It's full of criminals, transplants and posers, It's where people ask how much you make before your name. What do you expect in a city where among the top attractions to see are the CNN building and the Coca Cola Museum. Its saving grace is the Georgia mountains but it takes 2.5 hours just to get out of town to see them.
