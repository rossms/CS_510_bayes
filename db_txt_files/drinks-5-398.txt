Wheat beer, weizen bier, weissbier, all the same name, but each brand produces its own unique work of art. Weissbier is an acquired taste due to its banana twang, but those who try it will agree, it is truly a wonderful thing. Never put a lemon in it and make sure you get it in the .5 Liter glass. Franziskaner makes one of the best Weissbiers in Germany. The only bad thing is that pouring the beer is important. Make sure to get all the floaties from the bottle by swirling the last bit and dumping it in. This is the extra flavor that Weisbier is known for.
