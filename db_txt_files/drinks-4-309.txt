Good for what it does. Stationed in the middle east we were allowed only 3 beers a week. Everyone chose Grolsch in the big cans because of its 5.0 alcohol content. Ussually I could scam an extra one or two from a non drinker, but 3 would normally give a good solid buzz. Caution: this beer goes in...but has to come out the next day, if you catch my drift.
