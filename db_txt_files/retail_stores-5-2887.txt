My husband and I found my engagement ring at Whitehall. The salesperson was very friendly and helped us with any questions we had. We were very pleased with the ring, and all of the compliments! It is the buckle style ring in white gold. I loved how different it was from the traditional engagement ring. We got our wedding bands about a year ago and we couldnt be happier with them. I think that customer service has a lot to do with location. The employees at Whitehall in Pensacola, Florida are great!! I will definately be back.
