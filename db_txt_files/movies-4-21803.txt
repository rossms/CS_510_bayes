I saw this on New Years Eve was crying half the time so I cant rate it that highly but the final battles Gollum are worth watching Problem being the middle part of a trilogy nothing is resolved they started apart they remain Oh well I guess I will have to wait for the last one but major props for all who sacrificed their schedule to film all 3 and PJ not to win something after all that would be a disgrace!
