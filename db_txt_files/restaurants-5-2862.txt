Virginia/DC/MD/Delaware FINALLY has its own In and Out! These burgers are FANTASTIC, and only a dollar or so more than McDonalds. Their regular burger is the size of a McDonald's BIG MAC! Like In and Out, the selections are limited: Hamburger, cheeseburger, bacon cheese and they do have a beef hot dog. But numerous toppings to choose from, GREAT FRIES (cooked in peanut oil) and free peanuts to chomp on while you're waiting.
