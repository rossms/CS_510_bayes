I got a bottle of this tequila as a gift. I am a die hard tequila drinker, and I'd never heard of this one before. Let me tell you... it is smooth! I was sipping out of the bottle all night when I got this one (hey, I was camping, there were no glasses smaller than beer mugs!). It goes down nice both chilled and at room temp. I highly recomend this one.
