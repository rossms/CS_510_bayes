Six Flags has rides for every age! My young daughter just loved the Looney Toon Section. It has many shows, shops, and food courts. Yes, it can get crowded but it is not as bad if you go during the week instead of the weekend. For an all day event, the price is not bad. I would recommend it to everyone and can not wait until my next trip there!
