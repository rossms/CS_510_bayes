Keanu Reeves cannot act himself out of a paper bag. This film is terrible, predictable, and boring all rolled into one convenient package. Al Pacino is unbelievable, and not nearly as good in this film as others. Charlize Theron is HOT though, but there is not character development, and little plot development.
