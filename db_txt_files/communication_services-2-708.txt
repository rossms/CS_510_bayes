What I've noticed about Cingular Wireless that has gotten me really frustrated is that the coverage is horrible. The networking is too busy and never allows me to call out or recieve calls during peak hours such as right after work or around 9-10pm. A lot of my calls are forwarded to my v-mail and people are unable to reach me. The plans are great but what's the use of a phone that is constantly tied up?
