Shaq is the greatest center in the game today, and also one of the greatest all-around players in the NBA. He consistantly shows his dedication nightly on the court. By constantly improving his own game, he elevates the level of play on the basketball court for both his teammates and opponents(much like Michael jordan did). Shaq has been underrated for a long time and is finally gaining some well-deserved respect around the league. As he continues to improve, he has become the most formidable force in the NBA. Go Shaq!
