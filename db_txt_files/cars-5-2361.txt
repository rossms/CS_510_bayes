you now u r rolling big if ur cruisin in a Viper. They are outragously fast and incredibly unnessisary but damn are they saaaaweeeet! You wanna draw some stares, drive a Viper because there is nothing low-key about a 500 hp, 10 cylender, rear wheel drive supercar. I have had the privalege of driving in one and beleve me, they fit the description of sports car.
