MHC rocks!!! My Profs. are extremely available, charismatic and personable. The student body at Mount Holyoke is modivated, gregarious and effusive. Being in a single sex environment is the perfect balance. On the week days I can concentrate and relax on my school work, friends and extra-curriculars, but on the weekends I can hop on a bus to UMass or Amherst College and party at the frats! Everyone is exceedingly supportive and helpful. I would NEVER want to be anywhere else. Yeah Lyons!!!
