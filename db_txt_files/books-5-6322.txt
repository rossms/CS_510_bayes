Bill O' Reilly provides an honest and non-partisn views of the many different aspects of U.S. life today (what is good and bad about it). IT's your choice whether you agree with him or not. However, he does base his opinion just on factual merit. The point of the book is to get you thinking of what is actually going on, and how to watch out for yourself and others.
