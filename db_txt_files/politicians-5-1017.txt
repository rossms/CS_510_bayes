I would give him 4 stars, but 5 is to counterweight the bad comments. GOOD. I think Sharon is a better leader than anyone else I see on Israeli political arena. He is the only one who took a hard-line stance on terrorism and issues with PA. BAD. Going to Temple Mount was a mistake, also his inability to make any drastic choices like assasianating arafat is not a good thing. I understand he was pressured by US. But Arafat could have died of natural causes. For Israeli intelligence it is a piece of cake.
