Webber got a bad rap earlier in his career for being a bad guy. From his dispute with Don Nelson (which Nelson says that he regrets) to his problems in DC, he had become a symbol of what was wrong with the NBA. Then, came his trade to Sacramento and everyone thought that he would begin to pout and force them into another trade. Instead, Webber has finally turned into the player that everyone thought he would be...one of the best in the NBA. He plays hard, runs the floor, plays D, and has incredibly soft hands. He's a tremendous all-around player.
