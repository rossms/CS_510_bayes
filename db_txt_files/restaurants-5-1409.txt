I have always been impressed with the layout of Sonic. I enjoy that I can take as long as I need to order, when I'm ready, I never have had to wait long, and while I'm waiting, if I'm choosing to pay with cash I can get it all together and give it to them. I have always received hot, and fresh food, and for the prices of the hamburgers I feel I get a great deal. I enjoy the cream slushes, and this place offers a great variety of things and is a unique place to eat.
