A very good beer that I very rarely drink. I don't know why, but there just never seems to be an appropriate situation for this beer. When I'm just drinking a beer or two to relax I'll have a Sierra Nevada, or an Anchor Steam, or a Guiness. If I am out and about, I am more likely to drink Corona, Bud, or Tecate. Sam Adams is a tasty beer - prior to discovering Sierra Nevada, I considered it the best American beer. But for whatever the reason, it just has not cracked into my everyday lifestyle.
