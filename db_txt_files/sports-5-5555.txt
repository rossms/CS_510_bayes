Attaway Ray is the man. Southern boy. Great defender. #1 assist guy in the conf. #1 three point shooter in the conference. As clutch as a preacher's hand holding a $100 bill. The best handles on the PLANET. Fastest guy end to end in the nation. Tough. Smart. Great leader. Cool as hell. Attaway Ray. Young Carolina fans will be at a loss years from now, trying to tell their kids about him. Warrior.
