I think you either love Lucky's or ya hate em. simple as that. They have a reputation, like I've had people come up to me and say you're smokin a Lucky? are you trying to kill yourself? but it's something about the taste and the feel of the strong smoke that you can't get with any other kind of cig. I love em after a good date, or as an after dinner smoke.
