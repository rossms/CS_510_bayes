It's loud, it drips, and it breaks down a lot. It's slow and it uses cutting-edge technology from the 1950s. It's an American-made VW motorcycle. Just like VW has their undying fanbase, Harley does, too. If you don't understand the attraction, you never will. What a bike! For an old man's bike (ie not a Sporty), it's pretty friggin' cool.
