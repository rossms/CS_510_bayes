I really love this SUV. Nice style and everything is where it should be. Great pickup (even with the a/c on). One complaint.... there is this horrible window vibration when the back windows are down... it reverberates in your ears..it is so loud. I have to lock the back windows to keep passengers from rolling them down. Is it just my car? Something to test before you buy. Ride with just the back windows down. Other than that, the car is perfect...one of my friends loved mine so much she went out and bought the exact same car... same color...same options... everything!!
