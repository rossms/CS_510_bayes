Pretty mediocre, and at over $40 per case (that's up here in Canada, where alcohol is outrageously expensive) it's just not worth it. This is a very low quality beer, and if you go to Mexico, you'll notice only the Gringos drink it. I guess it's just trendy, and people think they look 'cool' with one in thier hand, like they actually appreciate good beer or something. As for the lime or lemon, I'd reccomend it. Helps to kill the skunky steamed corn taste. ugh.
