Good controlls and authentic choice of weapons. Plot is a little incoherant and confusing at times. Gameplay is consistantly well planned, although the game is pretty short. Hardly the epic adventures we have seen from the MOH range in the past. Not quite as good as Fotline, but does the job as an FPS.
