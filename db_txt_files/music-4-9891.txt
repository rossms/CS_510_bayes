While Christina Aguilera has a better voice and vocal range than competetor Britney Spears, I don't like her style of song so much. Britney had some great songs and some stinkers, while Christina ranges from Good to Okay. No great ones, no terrible ones. I don't think it is right to compare her to Britney though, because Christina has a different style of music. She puts a little Latin twist into her beats (or at least her producers do), and her music has some actual substance.
