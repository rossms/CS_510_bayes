Excellent doughnuts, they melt in my mouth every time I eat them. If your really into watching your health and weight then Krispy Kreme Donuts are not for you. I don't eat them all the time, but when I do I really enjoy them. They are made just how donuts should be made full of sugar and moist. No other donut franchise can compete.
