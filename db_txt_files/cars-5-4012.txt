I have had an '87 and now own a loaded 2001 and would never trade it for a Land/Trail/Envoy anything. The '87 was a tank but underpowered. The 2001 is classy, rugged, super roomy aned luxurious and, yes, sadly underrated. Interestingly I discovered that the Trooper is VERY popular in most African countries, Australia and the Far East (i.e. road-less areas). but somehow didn't get the same rep here. Could it have been the failed attempt to discredit the rig by Consument Reports? Don't know and don't care- the only regret is that Isuzu stopped making them. Glad I got mine!!
