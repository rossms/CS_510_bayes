A true classic from my childhood. I remember watching this with my brother over and over. And still to this day, When in the car with my brother or a close friend, we determine how many points we would get for running down bystanders. The theory of the movie is so cool. The characters are classic, noone could have done it better!!! You should watch it at least once!
