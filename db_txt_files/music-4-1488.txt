This, even though it was very mainstream and a bit poppy, was a nice relief from what you usually hear on the radio. it brought a bit back from 80's new wave and incorporated new ideas, overall the album is ver smooth and goes together well, with such an immense succes on their first album that half the songs made singles in the UK. Worth a listen.
