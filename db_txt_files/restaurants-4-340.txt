I think Wendys has some of the best burgers, and you can choose them bigger by adding more meats so your burger will be bigger than any other fast food place....Wendys burgers aren't dried up like some of the other burger places out their, however I don't like Wendys fries, everytime I get fries their they are slightly burned or taste like they have been sitting for a while and cold.
