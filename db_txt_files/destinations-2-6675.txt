OK, so you've been white water rafting. Now what? West Virginia is the last on just about every list where you want to be first and first on every list that you want to be last on, with the exception of crime. WV is one of the safest states to live in, probably because the only people left are politicians and people WITH jobs, where there isn't any for young talented people. The politicians have ruined the state economically, financially, as well as cosmetically. The only thing I have going for the state is that a majority of my family still live there, but they are either retired or getting close to it.
