I loved playing this when I was younger. It's one of the classics that was fast-paced and constantly challenging you. I'd go to the arcade and drop a few bucks playing just this one game. You gotta love a game that has a trak-ball! LOL. Playing Centipede at home w/ a joystick just wasn't even close to the original. Centipede was a really fun game to play.
