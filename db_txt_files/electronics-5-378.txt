I bought the Pioneer HTD-510DV and so far I have had no problems with the system. The quality of picture is nothing less than what I would expect from a Pioneer system which is pretty high. The price was $449.00 as of 15 Aug 01 and is better priced for comparible options than Sony, Panisonic or Kenwood. The setup of the system was very straightforward and I had it up and running in about 30 minutes.
