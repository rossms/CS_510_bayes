I stayed in Aleppo for a week in Nov. 2005 and had the time of my life. It's a fascinating city with friendly people and cheap prices -- a room in a hotel made from a converted town mansion will cost $50-75. And that bus ride from Damascus runs all of $5. The people are super friendly and eager to try out their English on you too. Aleppo is also a good base for excursions to the Crusader castle at Krak des Chevaliers and the picturesque ruins of the ancient city of Palmyra.
