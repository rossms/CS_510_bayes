This book was a real tussle to get through although in the end I did finish it. Called "Profoundly erudite, the ultimate puzzle book" by the NYTimes Book Review I call it Boring! I can't say I hated or liked the main characters. They were just blah. The excitement?... Not happening! The puzzle?... The climax?... The anything? ... Forget it. Save your money. Hmmmmm, maybe the puzzle was trying to figure out why anyone would publish this waste of perfectly good trees!
