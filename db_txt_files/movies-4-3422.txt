This was a pretty dang good movie. It has lots of big name stars and all are very well done. Most impressive are the roles played by Tom Sizemore and Colm Feore. The special effects are awesome. Basically this movie is 3 parts in one. There is the love triangle between Affleck, Hartnett, and Backinsale. There is the planning and the attack on Pearl Harbor. And the the planning and attack on Tokyo. Overall a great movie, though probably not for the kids. There are about 45 profanities and some gory violence, along with one unseen sex scene.
