it was a pretty good movie but totally off the wall. it was cool how the kids were the heroes for once and the adults needed to be saved because it gives kids much needed credit. i guess i say that because i am a teenager but that is what i think and i am not afraid to express my opionions so i do so openly. i will definatly see it again
