5 stars for the 3.5 V6......While shopping for a new car for myself, it came down between the Altima SE V6, and the GTP Grand Prix. I chose the Pontiac because it had more room, better control under throttle(the Altima exhibited a TREMENDOUS amount of torque steer), and the CLEAR advantage in low end torque. But I don't think I would have been disappointed had I purchased this car. In fact, I kinda wished I did sometimes. A fun little throw around, with a great engine and taut suspension.
