I've flown a couple of times with KLM and have never had a bad erxperience. The last time, I showed up at Miami for a flight to Amsterdam only 55 minutes (3hours rec.) before departure. I had an economy ticket that was booked on another date and they still let me board the plain. Too bad they changed their coke to pepsi!
