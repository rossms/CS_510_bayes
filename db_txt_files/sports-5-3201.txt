After 22 years as a Cardinal, Stan Musial ranked at or near the top of Baseball's all-time lists in almost every batting category. The dead-armed Class C pitcher became a slugging outfielder who topped the .300 mark 17 times and won seven National League batting titles with his hamed corckscrew stance and ringing line drives. A three-time MVP, he played 24 Al-Star Games. He was nicknamed The Man by Dodger fans for the havoc he wrought at Ebbets Field, and is still renowned for his skilled harmonica playing. Stan Musial was inducted to the Hall of Fame in 1969.
