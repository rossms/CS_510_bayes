I fell in love with the character Billy Hicks in St. Elmo's fire. I don't know what it was, but Rob was so beleiveable as the character. He has done a few other things that I enjoyed but when West Wing aired I was floored. Sam Seaborne was a great vehicle for Rob. It's too bad that there were money issued to keep him away from another season of West Wing. I don't know if Lyon's Den is going to give you the exposure that you need (no pun intended!) Sure miss you from West Wing though. Great body of work Rob. Keep it coming. I will wait to see what happens with Lyon's Den.
