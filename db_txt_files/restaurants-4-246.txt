I have heard a lot about In-N-Out over the past few years and finally had a burger last month while vacationing in California (I am from Michigan, no In-N-Out here). My boyfriend and I - we are in our EARLY 40s, no kids here! - only had single hamburgers and Cokes (no fries) and we found the hamburgers wonderful! The onion made the burger!!! The only reason for the 4? Not sure if the burgers were just plain good or because it was late (after 10:00pm), we were really, really hungry, or on vacation. Next time I am in CA, I will definately try In-N-Out again and then decide if they are really a 5!
