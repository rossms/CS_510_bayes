Suzuki claims that the XL-7 is the only small SUV with 3 rows of seats. To me, its an ordinary midsize SUV, so Im not giving in any credit for that. It sounds like a great package- 3 rows of seats, 4X4 starting around $20,000. Unfortunately, all reviwes of it have been bad, and looking at Suzuki's reliability record and I can see why.
