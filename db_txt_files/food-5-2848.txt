I want to thank everyone for ranking this soup #1. I had never tried, or even noticed it until I read about it on this site. After reading the ratings, I went looking for it and sure enough, there it was, tucked away by itself. After trying it I must say it is the best canned soup I have tasted. It has a few more calories than the others, but hey, it's worth it! They should advertise more, especially in my area. I had never heard of them here.
