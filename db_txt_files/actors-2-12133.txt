Wow, I didn't like her much before. I don't think she is that great of an actress. I don't think she's particularly hot either. I hated Dawson's Creek, and can't say I enjoy her movies a whole lot either. And well, now that she's with Tom Cruise I think I like her even less. How annoying...now I'm going to be stuck seeing her EVERYWHERE.
