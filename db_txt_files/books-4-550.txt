Entertaining but perverse. This one is bizarre to read, and I remember being scared for days from the movie version when I was a kid. Gene Wilder was perfectly cast as the weirdo Wonka. I still feel sorry for that girl that blew up like a blueberry -- but not for Veruca Salt (sp?) who definitely was a bad egg.
