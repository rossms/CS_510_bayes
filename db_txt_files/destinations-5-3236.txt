San Diego seems to combine the best of both worlds--a perfect weather climate, and a continually-solid economic climate. In addition, the surroundings are beautiful (beaches, mountains and desert all within an hour's drive), and entertainment opportunities abound. My vacations here have always been fun and memorable. My few gripes about the possibility of living here would include a relative lack of educational opportunities (not aware of any large or significant colleges/universities here) and a high cost of living.
