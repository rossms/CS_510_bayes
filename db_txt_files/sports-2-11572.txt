You would think SMU would be better, but when you see that they havent been good since the Death Penalty you realize this school just cant get it's act together. Meanwhile rival TCU has a solid program. Bennett should be doing well at SMU - great stadium, Texas to recruit from, some history to refer to as far as Football pedigree. They still suck and you cant help but think that an upwardly mobile coach could do wonders here. It doesnt appear that Bennett is that. Maybe being in Conefernce USA, things will change?
