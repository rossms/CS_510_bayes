The Harbor features a LOT of shopping, some nearby nightclubs, the Aquarium (great place) and the Science Center (with an IMAX theater). There are plenty of restaurants to choose from (mostly seafood, for good reason). It's close to Camden Yards, and is within walking distance to the Convention Center. The Harbor is accessible by Light Rail (which I strongly suggest--parking can be a real pain). In warm weather, there are also live entertainers by the water.
