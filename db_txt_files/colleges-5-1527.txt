I'm just finshing up my freshman year and I can honestly say that I've had the most interesting time of my life. So far most my professors have been good even large lectures.You'd be surprised how much interaction can go one between profs and class of 300+.They are willing to help students encouraging us to go to office hours. Not that the MSU doesn't have small classes. Many large class are broken up into discusson groups headed by TA's.
