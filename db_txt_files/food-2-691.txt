Not one of my favorites. I think I've had a life long distaste of Raisin Bran all due to my sister telling me when I was probably 5 or so that Raisin Bran was scabs and ticks. Well that did it for me, ever since then it's been just about the last cereal I'll eat and I still think of it everytime I dip my spoon into a bowl of it and everytime I feel a raisin give under the pressure of my teeth like a tick popping in my mouth. Awful sensation.
