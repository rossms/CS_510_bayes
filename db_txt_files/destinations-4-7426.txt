A great city if you like culture, shopping, and entertainment. Parts of it are beautiful as well, although there are numerous examples of the opposite. Also a great base for visits to Potsdam, Spandau and even Leipzig and Dresden. And a small comment to Daneyw's comment: No, Hitler wasn't born in Berlin. He was born in Austria.
