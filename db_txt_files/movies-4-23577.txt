Four stars for the cinematography alone. Felt like you were right there in amongst the forests, castles, and battle scenes. Loved picking out various actors here and there that you recognized, but had forgotten their names (took me 10 minutes to come up with Patrick Stewart). The final Lady In The Lake scenes always bring a smile. It's nice that it's an older film, 'cause it'd NEVER get made in the current climate.
