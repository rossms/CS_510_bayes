Overall very enjoyable although only a couple of tracks really stood out and grabbed my attention. Honey is sort of snappy but it makes me want to go out and buy a Bessie Smith album rather than listen to Moby rehash it. The last song, My Weakness is the best of all. For some reason, that song reminds me of staying at my grandmother's house as a small child. Odd memory coming from a 1999 techno album.
