Jason Campbell endured a change of offensive coordinator almost every season since starting as a freshman. A big strong QB that has performed very well this season. Not flashy but is more technically gifted and capable than all the fake QBs Spurriers system produced in 12 seasons combined. Deserves consideration as the best QB of the season.
