A very variegated offering from The Smiths. It has some of the most powerful of their songs like There is a light or the poignant I know it's over (Mother, I can feel the soil falling over my head). But then again, it also features pieces of fluff like Frankly, Mr. Shankly stuffed with silly schoolboy rhymes. Certainly worth buying.
