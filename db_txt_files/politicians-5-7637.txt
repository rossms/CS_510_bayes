Lincoln was the strongest of all of the presidents. His own party, for a considerable time during his presidency considered him a hack. He held to his principle beliefs and the Union survives today because of him. The constitution lives on today because of him. States still have most of their powers intact. He did what was right to preserve the union, even if some even today think it was unconstitutional.
