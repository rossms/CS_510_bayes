I enjoyed this the first time I saw it, but it's not one I'd watch again. It's not scary and the focus is more on the teenybopper crowd than on any real scares. The BEST thing about the movie is the Grandpa, Wilfred Brimley, who knows a little more about what's going on in town than anybody realizes.
