In Jacksonville FL, I have Alltel's unlimited wireless, home telephone, internet, and long distance on one bill. I pay less than $100/month for all. Digital service is very good in Duval, St John's, and Clay Counties. Only needed customer service once and had the usual delays(same with every company I've ever experienced). Phone selection is limited and pricey, but quality.
