I still love to watch this guy play. One of the few remaining true professionals in pro basketball these days. The guy is the ultimate team player, and amazingly ranked in the Top 5 in four categories this season despite pushing 40. He is one of the greatest point guard to ever play the game. Even though I like the Sacramento Kings, you can't deny what this guy has done in his great career. Hoep he plays a couple of more seasons.
