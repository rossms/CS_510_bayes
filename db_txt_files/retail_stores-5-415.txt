Excellent quality, classic style. Best place to shop if you are looking for beautiful clothing that will last you a lifetime (both in wear and style). This is a store that I wish I could shop at regularly..of course I don't really have a reason to since I am a mom and I work from the house..but it would be nice to sit around at my desk in a lovely Ann Taylor suit from time to time, or maybe go to the grocery store in some elegant Ann Taylor get up (instead of my usual uniform of my Gap jeans and white t shirt)
