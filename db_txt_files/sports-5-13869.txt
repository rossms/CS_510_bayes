Walter played his prime years on terrible teams.The opponents knew he was getting the ball, as he was the sole offense, and still couldn,t stop him! Emmit played on a team with numerous offensive weapons and a great offensive line! If he had played on the early Bear teams Walter played on, he would have been an average player at best!
