Simply the best bourbon I've ever found. Sure, it's a little more raw and a higher proof, but to my taste the higher proof balances the flavor a little better and ever so slightly sweetens it a bit. Great straight or mixed and easily stands up to any of the small batch stuff that's out there. My old man swears it's the only bourbon that still tastes like bourbon used to taste 30-40 years ago. There was a reason this was Hunter S. Thompson's booze of choice, check it out for yourself and see.
