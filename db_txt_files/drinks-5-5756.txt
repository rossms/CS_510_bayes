Still a Coke drinker, but this stuff is great! As with other Coke products, it seems to be made slightly sweeter in Canada, don't know why. Not as much of a throat-biter like regular Coke, the vanilla flavour is subtle, but not overly so, and is best savoured upon lightly sipping instead of gulping. The drink also appears to retain its flavour better in aluminum cans than plastic bottles, and I don't recommend adding ice. The extra water basically dissolves the vanilla taste.
