The movie was basically just a sequence of pretty pictures and poor acting and direction. The cinematography and score was decent, yet the acting was emotionless (the actor who played Arthur in particular). Clearly, the acting scenes were used to fill in the gaps between the battle scenes, which were the highlights of the film, packed with action and fantastic choreography. But a movie can't stand on action alone, and for a lousy script and lame acting, this movie gets a two star rating.
