Rex Harrison and Audrey Hepburn were excellent. It had its fair share of funny moments. The songs You Did It and Just You Wait were pretty lousy, however. This one's not as timeless as some others, however. And why didn't Julie Andrews (not that I have anything against Audrey Hepburn, besides the fact that she didn't sing), as Eliza in the film? She was famous for the role on stage, I just never heard why she wasn't in the movie.
