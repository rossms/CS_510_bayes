I've owned two of these. The first was a 1995 Highline with a 2.0 SOHC. The second was an R/T with a DOHC. I planned for the second to be a long-term vehicle, but at 50,000 miles, just as the warranty ran out, the sunroof stuck and the engine went bad. I'd called the tow truck to have it hauled to the dealer 3 times in the first year. My grandfather was a buy American kind of guy and I always purchased automobiles to please him. I am no longer fond of Chrysler vehicles, as I have a Honda Accord with 250,000 miles on it and I can't fathom that the Neon would have lasted that long.
