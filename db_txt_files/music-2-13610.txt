I wasn't pleased with this CD, however it wasn't so bad that I couldn't finish listening to it. I think there are a couple of songs that are o.k. but for the rest I think they are awful! I was offended when he puts ICP down in two of his songs. I am suprised that he is that childish. I have a whole new veiw on him and how he wants to portray himself.
