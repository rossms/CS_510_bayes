Pikachu is so cute! He is the cutest can be! The only Japanese character that does not give me the creeps or cause seizures(lol). When he says Pika! Pika! Chuuuu! - it brings tears to my eyes, it is just so cute! I used to own one of the Pocket Pikachu thingies, and I got so upset whenever he was mad at me, but I got so happy whenever he was happy! It was totally worth it! I don`t know where it is though... Ah well, bottom line is, Pikachu rocks! Waaaaay better than that tramp Hellokitty, and that weirdo Mashimaro... freaky. Way to go, Pika!!!!
