I guess you can't deny that crime is down in NYC and that it APPEARS like it is a safer place. However, under his leadership the NYPD has become much more aggressive (a bit of an understatement). And, as a result, their job has become much more difficult. Rudy's lack of compassion was shown to the whole world when he released the childhood record of an innocent minority male who had been shot by police only days earlier. Not only did he have no regrets about doing it, he claimed it was necessary to show what this guy was capable of doing. Shoot first, ask questions later.
