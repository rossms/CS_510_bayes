The Joshua Tree has got some awesome songs on it. While I enjoy the first half more than the second, Mothers Of The Disappeared (that's the title, right?) is really moving. Bono is such a great lyricist. Bullet the Blue Sky is majorly underrated, and In God's Country is one of the best songs of the 80s, in my opinion. Neither of the two number one singles are particular favorites of mine, and I believe that Achtung Baby was the band's best album. But this record is so packed with politics, great music and amazing lyrics...well, how could you not love it? Take care, everyone!
