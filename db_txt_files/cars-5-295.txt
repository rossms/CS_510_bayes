Designed by the great bicycling legend Greg Lemond, this road bike is truly a masterpiece. It combines comfort with reliability, the very light carbonite frame is very stable and the shimano shiftings prove to all that Lemond spared no expense. My father and I use this bike at least once a week and are satsified.
