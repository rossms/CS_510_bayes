Great Airport. I use this airport all the time. The parking is close and easy to get in and out of. The airport is very well laid out and the flights are almost always on time. Great place to travel in and out of. When deplaning your baggage is running on the claim carousel almost as soon as you get there. Its a small international airport in size and very reasonable in price to fly to and from. I would give this airport 10 stars if allowed.
