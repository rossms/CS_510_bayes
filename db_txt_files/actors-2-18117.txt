Not an actress to get excited about. Her current pairing with Jason (Steve Burton) was an awful choice for the show. The chemistry between them is zero and very detracting to Steve Burton. Instead of taking Anna Lee off contract, they should have taken Alicia off.Cannot get excited about bland and boring regardless of how cute she looks.
