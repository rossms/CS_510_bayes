Had my 996 SPS for tree years now. I really don t know what phuk4313om is talking about. I havn t had any problems whatsoever.... But it ir a bike without any compromises either you love racingbikes and it will fit you like a glove, or you are leaning more towards a sportbike and then the duc will be too specialized. But for the purpose of racing there is no other alternative.
