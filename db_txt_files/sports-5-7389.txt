Baylor didn't play defense like Jordan (although I think Jordan's defense, like the rest of his game, is overrated), but he was three-times the rebounder Jordan was. And considering he played without a three-point line and had to share the ball with West, I'd say he was a better scorer as well. Overall, Baylor was better than Jordan and at least as good as Oscar.
