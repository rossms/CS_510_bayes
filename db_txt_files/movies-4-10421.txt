I just rented this movie today.i consider this a good movie. there are some funny scenes.I liked it when Mel tried on the panty hose and other women things. The wax shave. His reactions to what other women were thinking. I like the fact that he became a better person when he learned about how others felt.After a freak accident Mel can hear women's thoughts. I thought it was pretty funny what other women were thinking. I like the fact that he helped the one woman who was considering ending it all when she felt unappreciated. A good movie, not perfect, but good.
