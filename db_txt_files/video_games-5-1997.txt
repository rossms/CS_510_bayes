I Got To Say. I own ABout every system with many games. but ZELDA Is The Number 1 Classic Game Out There. There are soo many swists and turns and many thing to get and beat before game completion. thismay be an n64 game but it is the best game on the planet. it takes time to beat and has a GreAt Story Line. Buy This Game if u dont have or ur gamming experiane wont be as good as those who have it
