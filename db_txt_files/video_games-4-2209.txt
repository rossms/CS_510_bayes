I gave the N64's MarioKart 64 game a good rating because it's a repeat of the Super Nintendo game MarioKart which everybody loved. The graphics and options have improved as well as the character selection. Another enjoyable feature is that the game responds better and doesn't have a tendency to freeze. It also is easier to control and you can do advance movements with analog control.
