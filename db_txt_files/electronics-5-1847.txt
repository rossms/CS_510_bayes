I love the Playstation 2. It just goes to show how far the original Playstation has come. Yeah I'll admit that the XBOX has good things about it.. but Playstation is the original console in the new gaming generation. It crushed SEGA and Nintendo.. and will continue to do so for eons. Heh... BURN IN HELL GAMECUBE!!!
