Mandela has spent a lifetime openly promoting socialist causes. Both he and his wife have engaged in criminal activities that were clearly aimed at self-promotion and not some noble revolutionary cause. The man certainly helped to bring about the end of apartheid but I believe that it would soon have ended without his involvement. It is sad to see the world duped into near-worship of this man.
