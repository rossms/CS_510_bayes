Thank God Bush was President when 9-11 occurred instead of Gore. If the Democrats were in power, they would have smilingly handed the country and our children over to the Al-Queda, while begging their forgivness for not being radical muslims . I love to read all the whining Democrats who lost. Democrats: Bush won, you lost - get over it (But they can't!). The best President since Reagan.
