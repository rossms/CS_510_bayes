By far this is my all time favorite cigarette to smoke. Tastes great with coffee, tea and beer. The all around best out of all the menthols and regulars I think. This cigarette has always had a bad reputation for being a ghetto cigarette. But this is partly because of Lorrilards advertising campaigns of the 1970's. NEWPORT is also the 2nd top selling cigarette in America right now. I recommend this cigarette to all smokers. ALSO- Lorrilard Tobacco is known for defending its consumers..unlike the evil Phillip Morris empire...they are nothing but a bunch of puppets for the anti-tobacco cartel...
