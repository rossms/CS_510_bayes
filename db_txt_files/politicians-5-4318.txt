I did a 2 week analysis on Lieberman and I cannot help but to encourage him to be a presidential candidate for 2004. He can get along with both parties while staying true to some major issues. I believe he is the strongest potential candidate to go against George W. Bush for the 2004 election. Sure, he is pro-abortion, but there isn't much anyone can do about that issue. If you make it illegal, there will be more close hanger abortions and possibly more deaths of mothers. This issue will never be solved therefore no one should base their opinions of a candidate soley of his pro-life/pro-choice stanz.
