Terrific vehicle for getting around in an urban setting, I'd hate to have to drive a full sized SUV in a similar setting. The Rav is small and nimble enough to get itself out of some pretty close situations. It could use a bit more power occasionally, but with a 5 speed is decent. On the other hand, gas mileage is great for an SUV, I don't think I'd want to be driving around in a V6 equiped SUV with gas nearing $2 a gallon!
