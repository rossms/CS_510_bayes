Absolutely great game!!! I'll have to play through it again before XII comes out. Great story, graphics, etc. I liked the inclusion of voice acting. My favorite part of the game was the Blitzball mini-game. Once I started playing it, I forgot about the story of the game itself for a few weeks. I played tournament after tournament for about a month before continuing with the game. Loved it.
