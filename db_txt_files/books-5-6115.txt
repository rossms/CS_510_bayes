Aside from the fact that they're getting dated, these books (there were three that I know of) are some of the best reads and most informative of all-time. They collected lists from various magazines and newspapers, contacted people for interviews, and compiled information from history to fill this book with... well, lists. I've read through all three of the books probably five times each. Most of it is trivial, but you sure can impress people with what you learn reading The Book of Lists.
