These things rock. They don't melt in your hand like other chocolate does and peanuts are chrunchy and salty and the chocolate is sweet, it's just the perfect combination. They are very addicting though. One bag is never enough, I always want more when I am done. Eating the last peanut M&M is a very disappointing event. Plus, I like all the pretty colors!!!
