I haven't had Fuddruckers in a while, but it sure was good. If you're looking for a huge burger on a big, soft bun, Fuddruckers is the place to go. They have a big fixen's bar with fresh lettuce, tomatoes, onions, etc. and free refills on the fountain soda. The fries and onion rings are also really good. If you're looking for pure sit-down dining with waitress service, however, don't go here. It's closer to fast food than sit-down and they call your name out when your food is ready to come to the counter to pick it up.
