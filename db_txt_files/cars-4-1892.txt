My wife purchased a 2001 Elantra after Consumer Reports' February 2001 edition noted the improvement in Hyundais in general and this car in particular. Dollar for dollar, a great value compared to everything else in its class. CR's report stated the back seat doesn't have cupholders but they do(they retract under the center of the seat). The standard base model is loaded with A/C, AM/FM, side impact air bags. Poor fit and finish on the gas tank door and a little rattle coming from the front right prevent a 5-Star score.
