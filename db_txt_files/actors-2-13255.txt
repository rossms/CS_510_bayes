Sigh ... she once had such promise ... beautiful, obviously intelligent (I always liked that she was a brain in high school and described herself as a bookworm) ... and then she flashed the camera in BASIC INSTINCT and suddenly (however unfairly) one just couldn't take her all that seriously anymore. Imagine her, at seventy, in a remake of SUNSET BOULEVARD ... Ready for my closeup, Mr. Verhoeven!
