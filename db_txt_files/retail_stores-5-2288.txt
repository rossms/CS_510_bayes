Trader Joe's is great for the gourmet and specialty foods niche. Also some really fantastic buys on wine. A good selection of quality organic foods. Their stock includes national brands as well as their own brands, including quality frozen seafood, cheeses, breads, cookies and crackers, sodas; really a wide variety at very decent prices. This place is a real step up from the average chain grocery, though you shouldn't expect to find everything here since the emphasis is on food and drink. I frequently shop here for wine and specialty foods I can't get anywhere else.
