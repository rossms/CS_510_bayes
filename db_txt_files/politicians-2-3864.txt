Yes he's a likeable guy. That's why he was chosen by the party to run. Likeable, however, does NOT make a good President. Let's take a look at what is at stake here people. George W. Bush does not have what it takes. Yes, I wish Al Gore were a bit more likeable but I'll take his intelligence, experience and work ethic over Bush's any day! My vote goes to Gore.
