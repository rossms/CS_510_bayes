My brother lived in Virginia a few years and I visited him there a couple of times. He lived in a historic neighborhood, and I enjoyed just walking down the street viewing the 200-year-old structures. (Having lived most of my life in newer states, this impressed me). There seems to be a lot to do here, and I wish I had had the opportunity to see Monticello and Colonial Williamsburg. I have heard Virginians complain about the high cost of living, but look what they are getting in return.
