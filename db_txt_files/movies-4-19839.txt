This movie was suspenseful, sure, but it by no means classifies as a horror film. It is actually much more of a science fiction film when you think about it. The plot was pretty solid and the acting was surprisingly good for a teen flick. I hear that the movie would've been much more successful had the studio executives not cut out so many scenes in order to reduce the length to 84 minutes. All in all, I'd reccomend this if you're in the mood for a sci-fi flick, not a horror flick.
