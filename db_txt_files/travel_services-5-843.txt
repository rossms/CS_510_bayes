Excellent service provider! On-time, polite and efficient..moved into Public Storage on June 3rd and have re-hired this Company to staff the move into my new home on August 8th. In fact, the office personnel were very accommodating relative to changes in my move schedules! I would recommend this Company to friends and colleagues without a doubt!
