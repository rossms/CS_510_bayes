Death and mayhem. I will give the game credit for complexity but the general feel of the game is base and lacking in entertainment value. A widely popular game so I am in the minority. I can accept that. Those I know who love this game are usually immature. Not to say all players who like it are but I find it interesting that they applaud the same aspects I find ridiculous. The game is obviously made with great effort so I do applaud the creators and designers.
