I went to Hecht's because of an ad on television. I paid and the sales associate couldn't figure out why I wasn't qualifying for the discount. She sent me back to the Executive Offices where I was treated rudely and was told the written ad in the paper explained all the limitations. I said that was not shown on the television ad and she shrugged and said it still applies. This is typical with misleading sales tactics from Hecht's, many times they have signs on racks that they say the items did not belong on, even though there are 10 items on it.
