Gene Wilder is one spooky dude in this film! Actually the whole thing is pretty frightening, right from the beginning when Charlie is with his four grandparents who all can't get out of the same bed (if memory serves right). Veruca Salt is one of the great annoying characters of all time, and the whole thing is captivating. It would get five stars if it weren't for the fact that it'll cause nightmares for 20% of the kids who see it.
