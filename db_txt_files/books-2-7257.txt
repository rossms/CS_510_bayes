Predictable and boring. How did 10 of these books get printed anyway? The location and specifics change, but the plot is always the same (at least for the first 6 I read). The story is told from the villain's point of view, you see where he screws up, and when the results come in he is somehow worse and worse off, but not quite dead. Since he tells this story from a prison, you know he'll never die, but after a few books you really wish he would.
