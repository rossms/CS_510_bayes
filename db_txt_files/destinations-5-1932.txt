People open your eyes - the question is Is the US a great DESTINATION to visit?? It doesn't ask Do you like the US? or Is US a great culture or not? The answer is VERY simple - for vacations the US is wonderful, like the lifestyle or the people or not. I don't want to live in Peru either, but it is a great DESTINATION to visit.
