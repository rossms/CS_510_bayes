WHAT A MOVIE! Three great stars (Clooney, Wharlburg and Ice Cube). Anyway, regardless of the stars this movie was tops. It was emotional, had action, comedy and was full of intrege. The effects of showing the damage of a bullet wound was factual and intense. The story was brilliant showing the need for pride and so-called justice in the armed forces. Great performances by all actors, full of laughs and action. If you like stories full of action, stunts, humour, truth and a bit of a hollywood kick than this is the one for you!! Go C it 4 yourself!!
