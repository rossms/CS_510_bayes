Not an actively unpleasant viewing experience, as I remember it, but really just a waste of celluloid, time, and effort. Brando was at the end of his career, and it's sad to watch. At the end of the movie, all I can remember thinking was, How stupid. What a waste. Why remake something that was done perfectly well way back in the 1930's as Island Of Lost Souls with Charles Laughton and Kathleen Burke? Now, that was a great movie...
