Very good food! Love the wraps, and the chicken sandwiches! But if you are tring to watch your weight, be careful , theres not much on the menu thats low cal or low fat. Also Atkins deiters beware, one wrap can be almost your daily intake of carbs. If your going for taste? Go for it. If your deiting find a small sandwich or salad and skip the fries.
