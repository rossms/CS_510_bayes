I am using Vonage VOIP service and it works great with CyberGenie. You get all the advanced features of premium local service bundled too! Like CID, VM, Call Forwarding, call waiting and others. Plus you get a phone number that you choose the area code for. Setting up the box takes less than 2 minutes and viola! Dialtone.
