It's difficult for me to rate a movie like this. I must admit I watched it several times before I decided never to watch it again. It fascinated me. There had been nothing like it when it came out. That's why it was such a shocker. But who needs to feed their brain with something like this? There are much more psychologically healthy ways I can be entertained. I would feel uncomfortable recommending it to anyone.
