i've been to this state twice; the Atlanta area. and with the exception of Stone Mountain and Kenessaw Mountain, i didn't find much redeeming in Georgia. Every store i went into i got an attitide as soon as i opened my mouth (my guess is b/c i didnt sound like a huckleberry). it was hot and muggy. just not a good time overall.
