This truly is a great game. It has a lot of Easter eggs and neat things to keep you busy for awhile. The gameplay is very good, and the controls are some of the best I've ever come across. It's nice how they added a first person aiming mode. The plot may be a little confusing but it's meant to be that way. The whole plant chapter was designed to mirror the plot of the previous game (on the Playstation.) They've also added a nice Dog Tag feature where the player collects dog tags to gain unlockables. This is very hard to complete 100%. In short, I love this game, and it is one of my favourites.
