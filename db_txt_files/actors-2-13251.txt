I don't see what is so great about her. The only film I liked her in is The Quick and the Dead. Let's not forget that she was the co-star in that infamously bad film, King Solomon's Mines, and nobody thought she was anything special THEN. Oh, wait, that was before she flashed her crotch in that other movie. Big deal. No doubt she flashed alot of crotch to get acting jobs over the years. Skank.
