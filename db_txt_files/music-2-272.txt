RHCP is one of the most overrated bands of the 90's. I do enjoy the song Blood Sugar Sex Magik, but the album is not as great as people make it out to be. Under the Bridge is weak...very weak. This song served to bring in millions of new fans and ultimately helped turn the Peppers into a ballads band.
