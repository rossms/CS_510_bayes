It's pretty hard to beat the Grand Tetons for an incredible, picture perfect postcard sight. You arrive in Jackson and head out of the airport, turn the corner and there they are lunging up out of the plains. I lived out there for a ski season and everyday it was still such an amazing view. Driving up to the Tetons to go skiing you had this strange sense that they you were going to some man made structure because it was so out of place, it was be like seeing a 13,000 foot volcanoe in the middle of the ocean.
