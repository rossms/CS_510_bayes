Marlboro Reds are the best. I know smoking at all is bad for me, but I might as well enjoy it while killing myself. The only second would have to be Lucky Strikes. Definately an interesting flavor, but hard to come by. (hate the unfiltered, but they're easier to find) To those who find it important to troll a forum like this, well phooey on ya. Even a dumb person knows cigs are bad for ya. I started with Reds and I'm pretty sure I'll either quit with them or die from them. Light, ultra-light, menthol, whatever, they'll all kill you. Might as well enjoy what's killing ya while you're at it. ;)
