This is one of my favorite videos out there right now. Directed by the amazing Spike Jonze, 'Island in the Sun' is one of the cutest, most inventive videos to come out in a long time. It is adorable, what with the puppies and the giraffes and such. A great video to go with a GREAT song, probably the best on the Green album. It shows Weezer's softer, more gentle side..and the monkey is absolutly wonderful.
