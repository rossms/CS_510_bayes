What an ingenious idea...definitely commend Bragg and the Wilco gang. And the first track on the album is wonderful. However, it began to lose its touch with me by All You Fascists . I agree pretty much with what Magellan said, and this does not deserve to be at position 255 out of 394. Poetry of Woody guthrie, musical gifts of Bragg and Tweedy...what more does everyone want? Sex appeal?
