Some days, I just crave the kick of the Cafe Latte! I don't find any of the flavors over bearing, and I still get enough caffeine to get me started in the morning. Cafe Latte is Idiot Proof, too.. just add hot water, and enjoy. The best flavor for me is the mocha, but the Vanilla Vibe is pretty good, too.
