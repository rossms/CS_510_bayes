Good film. Tom Hanks plays as Chuck, A guy who works for FedEx. His plane crashes and ends up on a deserted island and must survive for 4 years on it. He finds a FedEx box with a volleyball in it. He puts a face on it and calls it Wilson This film is a little too long but it has a lot of good scenes in it. It's more of a drama-like film with a little bit of humor in it. It was enjoyable to me
