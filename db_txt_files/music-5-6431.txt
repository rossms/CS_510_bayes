rammmstein are awesome. possibly the greatest thing in metal to come out of europe. because they don't make other peoples' music, they make what they want to hear. and it just so happens alot of other people want to hear the same thing. and for those of us lucky enough to have been able to find accurate translations of their lyrics it takes things to a whole new level. like the song Ich Will(I Want)that song rocks!!! and on their other albums: bestrafe mich(punish me), Asche Zu Asche(ashes to ashes), and of course buck dich(bend down).
