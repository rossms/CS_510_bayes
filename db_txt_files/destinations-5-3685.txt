This place was a total surprise! I had not expected to find a world-class museum, a fine orchestra, and a shopping district (the Plaza ) that can hold its own against Rodeo Drive and Fifth Avenue. One of the great mysteries of the modern world is why such a fabulous city is situated in the very middle of the USA.
