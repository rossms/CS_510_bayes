I recently purchased this beer - I'm always up for a new brew - I've never seen it before. It is truly outstanding, comparable to some of the better beers that I've had in Germany. It has a great, smooth taste and is not too filling. It complements most food and is certainly a treat all by itself. I wish they'd have this beer on the market year round - they can call it whatever they want. I'd drink it.
