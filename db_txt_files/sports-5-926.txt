How can this guy be rated this low? He is an absolute superstar and is within striking range of the Triple Crown which no one has accomplished in over 30 years. He is also the consummate leader. He was named captain of the Blue Jays as a 26 year old, before he had really come into his own as a player. Toronto definitely made the right move when they decided to keep him and trade Shawn Green.
