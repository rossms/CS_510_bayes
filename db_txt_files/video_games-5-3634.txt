The top, true originator of the full-scale racing simulation, Gran Turismo is spectacular in its use of exaggerated physics to make the gameplay accessible and exciting. Power sliding through a sweeping turn at 130 mph in real life would flip anything, but in Gran Turismo, it's the name of the game. Excellent multi-player rounds out the package, with match after match lasting into the night.
