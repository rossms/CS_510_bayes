Good, as music videos go. Not phenomenal, not incredibly innovative, but by God did it have influence. Classy and well done, with some awesome instrumentals. It's incredibly overrated, but that is not the band's fault. I have seen better, I have seen worse, I have seen things that make this video look like Apocalypse Now in terms of quality. In short, it's a good solid video with nothing too amazing about it. Take care, everyone!
