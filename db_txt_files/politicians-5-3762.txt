Geroge W Bush Carole and William Clinton song is ..Someday well be together I know I know I know know Someday while be together....He mad at you because he did worst than Al.Gore and I am telling you this because they are telling him If I dont win I am going to tell on you..Thas not your wife...Someday well be together...If you cant be nice to people you just have to tell the truth about people...You might have to wait until next year to become President...Maybe our song should be we have something in common.....
