I hate the bull people are giving me for the lose the other day to Illinois. I mean, Carolina lost 7 players. 7. The illini team still have two or three starters from last year. We only lost by a total of 4 points. That is good givin that the Illini team is number 12 in the country, or maybe that just means that there over rated and Carolina isn't! Call me win Illinois wins a national chamionship, maybe 4, like Carolina. Then call me and cry when all your starters go pro and 2 from the bench leave. ROCK ON HEELS!
