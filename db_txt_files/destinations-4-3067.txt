I've been there twice and I liked my experience. The people in the Bay Area are more trustworthy and friendlier than the ogres in Los Angeles. Bay Area is also more liberal and you can find all sorts of activities you can imagine, clubbing, sightseeing, biking, hiking, fishing, camping...you name it. The downside are the windy-chilly weather (during winter and fall) and the homos living on Rainbow avenue. Sorry, but that's my opinion.
