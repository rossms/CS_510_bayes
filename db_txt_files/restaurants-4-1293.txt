Good food but the prices are too high. I usually only go when the 5 roast beef for $5.95 deal is going on. Heck, the even used to be 5 for $5.00 but they raised prices on that too. It's a nice change of pace from burgers and somehow it seems more healthy too. Having two choices of fries (curly or homestyle) is nice too. But $1.95 for one sandwhich? That's too steep.
