This film probably holds the most appeal with the 50 and over crowd, due to their being in a similar place in life. There may not be a lot for 30-and-unders to relate to in the adventures of these characters, unless they can identify with Nicholson's and Bates' on-screen kids. It was a very good film - Kathy Bates is a genius at characterization. Jack Nicholson is quirky as usual.
