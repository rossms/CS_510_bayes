Fairly healthy and very, very tasty. Yeah, so what, the raisins are coated with sugar. As a society, we are sugar freaks. Nothing would be the same without sugar. Overall, this is a really good cereal that I enjoy eating if I'm in the mood for a somewhat healthy breakfast. However, just like Frosted Flakes, the cereal itself tends to get really soggy really fast, and then as Rebelyell said, it's just no good. So eat it up right away!
