None better overall*****!!!!!. When I say overall I mean considering ALL of the following, at least, such as drivability, cornering, acceleration, braking, reliability and comfort. How many of the other supercars will go 100K + miles without any problems and some of them even falling apart? How many of them will take doubling the horsepower on a stock engine and stay together mile after mile?
