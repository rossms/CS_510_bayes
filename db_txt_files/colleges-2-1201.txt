Does Yale require any training at all for its graduates in the sciences? Wm. Buckley seems not to understand scientific methodology, while Pat Robertson actually expounds the ignorance known as creationism. The new president seems to be in a vapor concerning any knowledge of science. Are the biology courses at Yale dealing with critical biological concepts? Are the courses at Yale as good as mine was at a California community college? I would be embarrassed to have ex-students such as George W. and the ignorant Mr. Robertson.
