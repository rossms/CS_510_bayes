This is my all-time favorite classic arcade game. I used to play it all the time as a child. I was average, but I enjoyed the challenge. And now that I'm 33, I still like to play it when I go on vacation to the beach. There's an arcade on the boardwalk that has Galaga, and I've made it a tradition to play it then.
