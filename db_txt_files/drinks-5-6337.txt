I drink a lot of ginger ale and I cannot disagree more with the contention that Canada Dry is better. Canada Dry has a weird, artificial, chemical aftertaste. Seagram's had a more fresh, sweet balanced taste. Except for some of the gourmet ginger ales (which have much more of a ginger kick), I find this to be the best mass-produced one on the market.
