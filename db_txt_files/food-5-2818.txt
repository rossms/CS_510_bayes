Progresso has come along in the past 10 years and has given Campbell's soup fierce competition but I don't think, in my book, that they have dethroned the Chunky style of Campbell's soups. In fact, I find the Chunky's version of New England Clam Chowder to be way more filling than Progresso's version. In fact, there's more water involved in Progresso's.
