I just recently traded in my '88 Toyota Corrolla for a 2000 Sonata. I have been very pleased with it. So far I like almost everything about it. The things I don't like aren't enough to complain about and are fixable. It is a good car for me to drive to school. It's comfortable, rides good, has front-wheel drive (for snowy days), good gas-mileage, and has enough power. It doesn't have a lot of bells and whistles but I don't need alot. It's very nice for the money that I paid for it and I am very happy with it.
