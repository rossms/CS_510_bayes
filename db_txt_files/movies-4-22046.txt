I have to second Wiggum on this: Aliens is awesomely done, and better than the original. However, I can't stand on its own. This partially owes to the fact that most of the sequel was put together for the FIRST movie. I think I still have my copy of Weird Tales , talking about Aliens being released, and it showed the fork lift machine, and several other characters and components from the second movie. I thought they did an excellent job casting and writing for the Marines. Reminded me of the Gung-Ho people in Sargent school. A great thrill ride.
