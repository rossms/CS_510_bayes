Allen iverson is a great player and it hurts me to hear people talk about him.If their not talking about his tatoos their talking about his pass.But they can't never say he made it through a struggle and good things like he is one of the best to ever play in the game ,his crossover,or jumper.but i hope he make the olympics.i want to tell allen to keep his head up and keep during your thing and froget about the nagetive people say about you from your biggest fan Mrs.Iverson*all hats off to allen!!
