wholy cow this is a damn good album!! I was surprised how solid the entire album is. And it has a lot of diversity, from killer ballads to high energy grunge. these guys write great songs!! Sometimes the singer get on your nerves, but the solid songwriting makes up for it.This album is definitely one of the best rock albums to come out in a while!!
