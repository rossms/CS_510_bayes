Of course, BYU is privately owned by the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints, and they make no bones about it. There are some very strict rules that you have to agree to live by, such as no alchohol, tobacco, coffee, extramarital sex, pornography, etc. They also have a dress and grooming standard prohibiting short shorts, halter tops, sleeveless tops, long hair or beards for guys, etc. So, if you don't want to deal with that, don't bother coming. But if you can live with these restrictions, it's a great place.
