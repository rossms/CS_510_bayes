I don't like fast food joints overall, but I have to give props to Wendy's. I just started a part-time job there, and the food is actually fresh. They slow back their potatos in the oven, actually make the salads and they have the best hamburger buns! This is probably the best you can buy as far as fast food goes. A resturant industy magazine rated wendy's corp #1 for the past 15 years. That says something...
