Papa John's is definitely the best pizza chain, especially when you're a college student. Not only does the pizza taste really good, but the price is unbeatable. You wouldn't believe how many pizzas college students go through when they're having their 2 large 1 toppings for $12 special. The garlic dipping sauce tastes awesome on the crusts, making the whole pizza worth eating. I've always had excellent delivery service as well. The taste to price ratio can't be beat.
