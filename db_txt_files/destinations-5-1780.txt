The States does have it's faults but it is the best country out there. Some people don't like the states because we don't have socialized medicine, well imagine this: If people get to got to an ER for free then they can go if they're farting and think they may blow up, look at most people who are on Medicaid, Doctors will not get paided as much, therefore most people will not want to go thru the 4 years of college, 4 years of Medical School, and then residenciy if the pay is chicken feed.
