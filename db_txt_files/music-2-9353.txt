This video is all right. Better than most of Limp Bizkit's lame ass videos. A dark video until it descends into poor animation with a naked Fred looking guy getting chaced by a hot dog monster. I gave this video 2 stars only becAUSE OF THE EXTREMLLY Cool part where Wes Borland's head falls off. That is the only awesome part of the entire video. the rest is just, whatever.
