Of the six films that I've seen directed by Akira Kurosawa, I have to say that The Hidden Fortress is last on the list. And that's not necessarily a bad thing, as you can see by the rating I gave it. It's a fun movie, yet, nothing about it really grabs me like other Kurosawa films like Ran, Sanjuro, Seven Samurai, Rashomon and Yojimbo. It's a good movie, nonetheless, but it's not a personal favorite.
