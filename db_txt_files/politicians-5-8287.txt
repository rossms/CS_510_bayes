John Adams has an extremly interesting life, and he has a great background. He seems like he was a very caring, nice man. He seems like he spent a lot of time trying to keep the world in one piece, and he was the first president to live in the white house, so he started something special there. Maybe that's why George Washington's life was such a bore.
