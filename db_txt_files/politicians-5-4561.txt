She's a tough old goat. I like Ms. Albright. She is a tough cookie and not afraid to speak what is on her mind. Don't be fooled by her matronly appearance...she is a pitbull, and has done alot for our nation. I really gained respect for her recently when I saw her grilling a French diplomat for France's stance, or lack thereof, on the war effort in Iraq. Way to go, Madeleine!
