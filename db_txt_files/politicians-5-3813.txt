The son has avenged his father's 1992 defeat! Bush will win Florida and all will be right in my world. I am a woman who was not scared into voting Democrat for fear of losing abortion rights. The Republicans know they can't change that (at least not in one election), and I doubt they EVER will. I am a proud Republican, Bush supporter, and American. Go, George, go!
