A city that is desperate to prove how cosmopolitan and international it is and usually comes up short. Has something of a small-town chip on its shoulder, and coupled with an occasional foray into a wild frontier mentality makes it a little peculiar. A port city with all the usual dangers that brings, prominent among which are the city police who behave like cowpokes on payday. Having said all that, it is a beautiful place, with gorgeous women.
