Definitely one of the top 32 QBs in the league. I am neither an Eagles lover or hater, but come on! He has moments of brilliance. So does Jake Plummer, and the only thing you hear about him is how ugly his beard looks. In my opinion, McNabb has always used "injuries" as an excuse for not performing up to par. Not just this year. Yeah, it is great and gritty when a QB plays hurt. But not when that hurts his team. If you are such a great leader on the field, how about taking a couple of games off and play at 100% instead of the annual "I'm doing the best I can."
