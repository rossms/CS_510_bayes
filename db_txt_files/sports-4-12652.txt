UT has one of the best rosters in college football. It is a shame that these players have just an average coach. Watch the passing game, and the receivers are all out of sync, and the quarterback always has a hard time finding a rhythm with them. The offense depends solely on the physical play of their players, because the system is poorly managed and coached. Rhythm, repetition, and timing are the keys to offense, and UT can never find that when faced with a team of equal speed and skill.
