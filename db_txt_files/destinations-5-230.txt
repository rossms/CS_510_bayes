The first time I went I hated it (but I had chicken pox, stayed in a tent by the interstate bus station, and it was 117 degrees). But really, it's amazing; so many relics from the last 1000 years or so that many (especially, perversely, in New Delhi) of them are totally untouristed. Good markets, bookshops run by people who love books (whoa!!! a novelty if you come from England), weird and funky things going on all over the place. But you need time to ease into it, especially if you're an Asia-virgin.
