It is hard not to like and appreciate Savage Garden: Popstars who seemingly understand the nature of their audience and harness this knowledge with the intent to actually inspire something more meaningful in their fanbase than the usual pop droll. Affirmation is lyrically a blessing on a music scene saturated with misogynistic, regurgitated crap which hardly helps the suppressed and abused consumers it is fed to.
