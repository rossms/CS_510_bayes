Marky Mark and Jennifer Aniton. Two actor who are completley unappealing. A movie about a want to be,who got to be. As horrible as this movie seemed to look I ctually took a chance and watched it. Though Marky and Jennifer give their usual blah perfomances, the directing style and fun metal goofy soundtrack make it a little bit more watchable. Still, I do not Recommend thi movie to anyone with any self respect. Might have been a better placed film in the mid 80's.
