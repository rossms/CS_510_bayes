I love watching Ray Allen play. Talk about a player with some skills. He is such a tough match-up. He can shoot lights out, but if you try to get up in his face, he'll blow right by you and jam over your center. I don't understand why the NBA hasn't tried to market him more. After all, he is a great player who is clean cut and regarded as a good guy. Even if the NBA doesn't wise up, Allen will continue to be one of the best players in the league.
