Pedro's an extremely competitive pitcher who gets the most out of his abilities. He's been an ace for quite a few years now. Pedro's bread and butter is his fastball in the mid 90's that tails in on the fist of right handed batters and he has developed an excellent change-up over the past two seasons to complement his fast ball. Pedro is an intimidating pitcher and has a reputation as being a headhunter. Unfortunately, Pedro doesn't go deep into the ballgame like other pitchers of his caliber and has a tendency to injure easily.
