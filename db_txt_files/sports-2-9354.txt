At best a luxury for any team to have; wouldn't stick anywhere but LA currently. Nonentity during the regular season, doesn't show up every day effort-wise, and a little dirty to boot (David Robinson's groin and I was in attendance when he threw the towel at Danny Ainge). Lots of guys can hit three pointers undefended when the defense sags on alpha-beta combos (Shaq/Kobe; Hakeem/______). He's one cheap shot or big playoff miss from being waived.
