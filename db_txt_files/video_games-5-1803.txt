Risk rocks. My first geography lessons came from the Risk board: Irkutsk, Madagascar, Kamtchaka... And who can forget the classic Risk game between Kramer and Newman? You say the Ukraine is weak! Ukraine not weak, you weak! Seriously, Risk the PC game is great - when you play against the computer, the artificial intelligence actually puts up a pretty good fight. But, like most other AIs, it's a little too predictable. Still, all the variations on gameplay, combined with the nostalgia factor (for those of us who grew up with Risk), make for some solid entertainment.
