I loved this movie for the most part. Lots of good actors. Great musical numbers. the only part that still upsets me is when Nancy is killed at the end by Bill Sykes.I always hate to see the good guy die. Other than that, I love this movie. Fagin is funny, Oliver charming. I still enjoy watching the movie.
