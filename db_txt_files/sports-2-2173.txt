I believe the Reds will start to fade pretty soon. I'm not sold on Cincinnati's pitching staff, either the starters or the bullpen. The Reds also appear very weak in the infield with Freel, Jimenez, and Larkin. They are strong at first, however, with Sean Casey (esp. with his bat). Reds strongest area is their outfield with Griffey, Kearns, and Dunn.
