Reached his level of incompetence as a director in The Alamo. Could have been a really great movie. The production values and cast were excellent but it was not put together very well. It also could have been more forthright. The reason that the Americans in Texas wanted the Mexicans out of there was because slavery was illegal in Mexico while the American planters wanted slaves for the plantations they were planning in Texas. Of course, that would have destroyed all the heroism.
