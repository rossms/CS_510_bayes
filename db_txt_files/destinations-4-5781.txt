People like opinion585 are different from some of the other liberals on RIA. You see, opinion585 doesn't care what reality is or what logic says, rather he/she just wants to twist everything to an anti-Bush message. ANYWAY, Florida is a great state! The beaches are pretty good and the resturants are wonderful! It doesn't get a five only because every time I go there, my glasses fog up as a result of the humidity (lol)!
