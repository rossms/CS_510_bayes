I think Bush is a basically honest man. Like many politicians, he is too loyal to his friends. I respect his uncompromising disposition; compromising often means that neither side really cares. He has a clear vision and if he received more co-operation some of it might become a clear reality. I also enjoy his style of public address; he is not really stupid and bumbling.
