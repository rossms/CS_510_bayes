A curious gin that may not be for everybody. I found it to make the most splendid martinis and my non gin-drinking friends really enjoyed it as well. It has a rounded flavor and clean but aromatic finish. Curious note: this is a Scottish gin made with rose petals and cucumbers - along with the usual botanicals.
