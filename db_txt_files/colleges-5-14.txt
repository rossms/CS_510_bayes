Hired a Temple MBA + three years experience, one year ago. Possibly the best hire our firm has made in quite a while. This person is very hard working and quick on picking up new ideas and techniques. It seems as if they had much more experience than three years beyond the MBA program. We;ll be sure to look for 'Temple MBA' on future resumes.
