As a baltimore native, I'm proud of the steps my city has taken. Cherry Hil, Highlandtown, Sparrows point, and all those areas are coming back strong. Downtown is loaded with bars and clubs and other forms of entertainment. Seafood is amazing, and great ethnic foods can be found everywhere, from Afghani to Italian. Only a couple of bad areas, but every city has a dark side. Anyone who thinks that baltimore is just a crime-ridden, drug-infested town has watched too much of homicide and the wire. They should come visit some time.
