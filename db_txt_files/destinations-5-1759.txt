Best hidden treasure south of Mexico. Visit the Mayan pyramids of Tikal, have coffee in Antigua, and then, get out of your comfort zone and see the country! Take a spanish course before you go, take the bus as often as possible, and learn a little about life out of consumer-usa. Lonely Planet has the most accurate travelers guide, but be ready for surprises, hike a volcano, and have "riceandbeans" in the carribean. This is not the 80's, this is not your carribean cruise, learn to think on vacation.
