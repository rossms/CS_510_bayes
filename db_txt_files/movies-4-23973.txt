Once again, Captain Jean Luc Picard shows us how important morality is. After finding out that a small tribe of people will be forced to move because of the natural resources on their planet, he tries EVERYTHING to give the Council of the Federation a new opinion. Yet, this was all in all a little bit too slow. The idea to let 500 people benefit from a source that could provide millions a chance to live was a good point too! Yet still, it is Jean Luc Picard, the master of morality and the Prime Directive.
