Subway is especially good when the bread is fresh. You can make your sandwhich as healthy or unhealthy as you'd like-add more cheese, meat, etc... They have gotten a little skimpy on both of those I think more since they started promoting the healthy Jared program. I use to like the meatball subs but the meat has gotten kind of grainy-tastes more like some kind of meal is in it.
