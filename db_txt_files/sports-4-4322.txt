All players should be allowed to play. Wether it would be 3 minutes or 2 minutes left.The last 3 games, I have seen 2 certain players sit on the bench. Tubby made a comment that the players have to earn their spots. Well, how are they supposed to earn their spot when they don't get a chance to play. Sure Tubby Smith is one of the best coaches, but the starters aren't the only ones on the team.
