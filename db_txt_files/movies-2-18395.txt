This movie is only scary in how unfrightning it is. I had to ask myself Is this a horror movie or a sedative ? This movie is slight fun if you have a few of the guys over and it is everyones first time seeing the movie.It has it's moments. But how in the hell did that little kid get his mother in the attic? The guy who plays the father and husband sucks and cannot act worth a crap. If you are by yourself you won't be scared of the movie you will be scared that you spent about five bucks to rent it. Now that's scary...
