Not bad. Not that good. But not bad. C+ UPDATE: I'm going to change my rating froma three to a five. A couple of weeks ago we had a small dinner party for my mother's 76th birthday at Outback's and along with my perfectly cooked (medium rare) Porterhouse Steak, I also had to eat my words. Everyone at the table enjoyed their dinners. My son in law and daughter both ordered Prime Rib and it was cooked to perfection. On the basis of that great meal I'm corecting my earlier review.
