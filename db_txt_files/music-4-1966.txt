The CD is wonderful. Our Lady Peace continues to make great music. I personally like Clumsy the best but this record is a wonderful mix of Raines vocals, interesting guitar and drumming and bassing. Raines lyrics are deep and astounding at a time when music is very shallow and repetative. Buy the CD and go on ourladypeac.com for more information. There is no band like OLP!!
