Wally Payton ... # 34 Chicago Bears ... I loved to be alive to watch him. Give Payton the ball, and he was gone. The reason Soldier Field was replaced is because # 34 tore it into pieces with his play. He was a real ambassador to the NFL game. There were no drugs, just grit and determination, mingled with hard work ! Walter; NFL fans miss you !!!
