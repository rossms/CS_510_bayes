Time for a change. This team has too much talent to be mired at .500 this late in the year. The streak against Florida is, Bowa's words, embarrassing. Pitchers are overthrowing and everyone else walks on pins & needles in the clubhouse. Bowa second guesses pitches, pitch calls, and just about everything else creating a pressure cooker atmosphere. This Phillies team is not having fun anymore, and they're playing like it.
