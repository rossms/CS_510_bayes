Nice people, great culture, excellent food. The Biloxi Mississippi casino is off the hook. These people down here are real friendly and down to earth people. People take real pride in religion and it is progressive unlike Northeast states like Massachutsetts (dirty liberals), Vermont, and New York. I love the beaches -- nice fine white sand. I wouldn't have it any other way! Down south yall.
