Recently (March 2005) traveled in Cambodia with my 19 year old daughter. One of our favorite places in SE Asia. Delightful people, little hassle. The Angkor temple complexes are unique. We spent 3 1/2 days in Angkor and only scratched the surface. Siem Reap has a number of good restaurants and places to stay for the budget traveller. We'd return in a minute. The trip to the Thai border by taxi was a three hour thrill ride. Wouldn't subject my daughter to that again. Still too dangerous.
