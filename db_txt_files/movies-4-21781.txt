I found this film to be about as good as its prequel with simmilar results. The film contained excellent special effects which really drove home the realism of Middle Earth. However, the entire sub-plot with regard to talking and walking trees was not well developed, and essentially childish. Gollum was excellent, but not oscar worthy.
