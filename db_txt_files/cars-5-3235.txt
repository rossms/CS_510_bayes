This is a class A vehicle. A substantial car with lots of extras. Most importantly, it is an extremely smooth ride for an SUV, a beautiful look and full of practical, helpful features. The sereo system is awesome, the memory feature on the power seats and window is a must for more than one driver, and the power source, first aid kit and built in 'cooler' in the back are the added touches that an owner will come to appreciate.
