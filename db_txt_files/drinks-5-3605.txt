Wonderful drink if done right, I've had a few that were over-sugared. It should not taste likey syrup was poured into it. Refreshing and herbal, touch of sweet and a bit of fizz from the club soda. Stay with the traditional, no juices or fancy stuff, just mint, sugar, lime and soda- maybe a dash of bitters and a float of dark rum too. Yum!
