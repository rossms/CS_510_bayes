Why is he even on this list? By all accounts he has a bad attitude, shows up late to practice, blows off meetings, and 68 RBI's is pretty pathetic from a third spot. Who cares if he is top 10 in the league in on base percentage? So what if he is leading the Phillies in virtually every offensive category? Who cares if he has a cannon from the outfield and consistently among the league leaders in assists? The bottom line is that intangibles win championships, and Bobby Abreu is a bad seed. If I were the Phils I would trade this guy and get a good young pitcher.
