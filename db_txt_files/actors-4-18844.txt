Reitman's more recent movies (like Twins ) don't do much for me, but Stripes is one of the funniest movies ever made. I'd give Reitman five stars if I thought most of the laughs in Stripes resulted from his directorial skills, but if you take Bill Murray out of that movie it wouldn't be half as entertaining. Same deal with Ghostbusters, Reitman's second best effort. Still, you have to give Reitman credit for bringing out the best in Murray. Plenty of directors have lots of talent to work with but still manage to mess it up.
