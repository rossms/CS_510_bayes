I really appreciate and depend on Lands' End products, particularly because I am tall and I like good quality clothing. Meaning clothing that will last and that fits well. I also appreciate the help I receive from the customer service reps. They do a great job! I look forward to receiving Lands' End catalogs even when I just want to browse.
