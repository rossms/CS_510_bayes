Nice place to stop if you want to break up the road trip from the south (Ecuador)up to one of the major cities but probably not worth staying more than a couple of days in. Some pretty architecture etc. but not the most prosperous city in parts. Try not to arrive at night because the bus station is not in the best area and they are long, lonely, dark streets into town.
