I've watched him play some, and I've got to say he is the best pure shooter in college. Great overall player, despite not having the God-given athleticism of other players. One thing I don't understand, why do some many people just plain hate him? He hasn't done anything to deserve to be treated like he is. To play great every game like he does, while having to stand hateful remarks from fans has to take some mental toughness.
