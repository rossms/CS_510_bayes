Derek Jeter is the kind of player that baseball needs. He is great with the media, he's a great leader, and he love's the game. Jeter is the kind of guy that all the little kids look up to. He's a great example to everyone, and he can play. He almost always seems to be there when the Yankees need that one hit or that one catch. He delivers in the clutch and loves the pressure New Yorkers put on him. Yeah we all dream of becoming Mrs. November one day, but thats not why I give him a 5. He's classy. I like that.
