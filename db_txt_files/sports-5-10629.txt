Who would have ever thought that Utah football would ever be a top 10 team. Meyer did a great job with the Utes after making Bowling Green a top 25 team as well. His first year with Florida wasn't overly impressive, but not disappointing either. I expect that he will be able to make Florida a national title contender again from the SEC.
