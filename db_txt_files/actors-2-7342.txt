To say that Vin Diesel is a COMPLETELY horrible actor is a misguided statement. He actually has had some good performances (Saving Private Ryan, Boiler Room). It's when Vin goes into a leading role where he is just horrific. If he wants to be taken seriously among other actors, I think he should just stay with his supporting roles as he isn't proven to carry a movie with his acting abilities.
