One of REM's greatest CDs yet, it is less known than it should be. This album definitely borders on melancholy/depression, but truly a subtle work of art. The album flows smoothly, has energy at times, but is mostly a mood album. Great instrumetation, colorful lyrics, and powerful songs. This is REM experimenting with music and moods. Awesome!
