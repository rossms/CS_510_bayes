I used to smoke Newport Menthols but one day I thought i'd try Camels. Wow very smooth almost went down and tasted like they had menthol. There not as thick as Marlboro full flavors but there just right. If you smoke and havn't tryed them before try them you'll probably end up switching. The non-filters ones are really good too if you can handle it.
