Sometimes its hard to be a fan of a team that finds new ways to lose a locked up game, unable to make any adjustments during the game. But this is my hometown, and we must represent. We defend our turf against all who enter our domain. Intimidate all with spirit and support no matter what the scoreboard says. We shall win it all someday and I will be there through thick and thin!
