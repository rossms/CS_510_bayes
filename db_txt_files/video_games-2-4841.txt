The multiplayer for this game is top notch except for all the bugs, glitches,and cheaters online. As for the story I have to say the game sucked and did not live up to the hype; also I don't give two large craps about what rock band did the music or what hollywood stars did the voice acting. Halo 2 is nothing more than a wanna-be starcraft, independence day starwars with medievil roman catholicism thrown in. The campiagn is boring and slightly exciting at some parts and since when did the alien guys learn how to speak sophisticated english. Suck a dick Bungie!!!
