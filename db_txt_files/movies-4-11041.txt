I liked this movie it was cute. It is about this girl named Mia who finds out from her estranged Grandmother that she is a princess of Genovia and she has to be transformed into princess material . But Mia is an unpopular girl who is a bit awkward. Part of the transformation is to take princess lessons. In the end she will have to decide if she would like to be the princess of Genovia and she makes this speec at the big ball she was preparing for. I Julie Andrews makes a perfect Queen and Anne Hathaway did a good job playing her role of Mia.
