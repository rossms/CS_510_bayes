I have a '99 Honda Civic Coupe with manual transmission. It had to have major transmission work at 50,000 miles. Honda Service said it was not covered under warrantee, but changed their story after I complained. My sister had a '98 Honda Civic (automatic transmission). She had to take it in 6 times for repairs in the first 8 months of owning it new. She also had to struggle to get things covered under warrantee. If you are considering buying a Honda, google Honda Civiv problems transmission. I would not buy a Honda again.
