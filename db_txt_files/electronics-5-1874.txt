Xbox is the best console today or in the past.Its crushed the gamecube and the only reason it hasnt done the same to ps2 is because of the hype.Thats all the ps2 is the games are crap and look awful some are ok.I mean i have a ps2 and gamecube and have 3 games a piece for both systems.Xbox I have around 20 games and 10 on xbox live.Why the games look and play so much better and xbox live is the only way to play on line.Plus for the price it is at now its a steal everything you need is in one box.It may be number 2 right now but xbox and xbox live is the future of gaming.
