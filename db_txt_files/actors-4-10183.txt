a 4.5 to me. I know she has been around for some time but with all the attention she got from the Oscars I am just beginning to notice her work as an actress. She did a very fine job as a 1950s wife in Far From Heaven, I liked her work as the kind woman who forgave a family for the death of her child.In a Map of the World. So ar she shows to be a good actress. I would be willing to see more of her movies now.
