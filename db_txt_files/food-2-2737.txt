Admittedly, this is a somewhat biased review... I am just so UPSET that these things replaced the Cookies and MINT candy bars at stores. Those were so much better... that was REAL chocolate. Anyway... it's white chocolate. If you like white chocolate, maybe you'll like this candy bar. As for me, I think we need to start a campaign to get the Cookies and Mint bars back!
