My old 1987 Camry is the best car I ever owned. Fast, reliable, with a full set of electric help such as electric windows, sun roof, door locks. The tempo mat is nice and the 5 gears manual box is quite nice. I gave away my former 1996 Pontiac Grand-am and switched for the Camry. I will never regret.
