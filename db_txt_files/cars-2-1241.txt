I purchased a 2002 Altima 3.5 V6 in June of 2002. In Feb. of 2005, with 21000 kilometers on the clock (conceded, low mileage = brake rust danger), major rear brake repair for rust and seizing. No problems noted for front brakes at that time. Jan. of 2006, major front brake repair for rust and seizing, and rear brakes seizing, with 23000 km on the clock. From Feb. 2005 had been consistently using the parking brake, when parked. Obviously, with that strategy, no improvement. Would continual brake servicing have helped? Maybe, but at what cost, either way? Will I ever by another Nissan? No.
