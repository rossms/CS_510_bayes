The only place in Indiana that I have visited is Evansville. While I was going thru this small city, I felt really comfortable, and the people were really down to earth and nice. Evansville reminds me of a hard working people town. It was clean too. I would visit this town again, and I would love to see the rest of the state as well. :)
