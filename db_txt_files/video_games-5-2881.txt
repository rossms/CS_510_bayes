An absolutely breathtaking video game that combines almost every aspect of your favorite video game into one perfect formula that will leave you addicted and playing for hours on end. San Andreas makes improvments on Vice City in that your character actually has attributes you can change, such as Muscle, Fat, Stamina, etc. Very, very big map in this game, as it will take you a good 15 mins to drive from one side to the other. Great 90s-based soundtrack also. A game that has no equals.
