Ah, yes, the killer of Zayre and the store that drove K-Mart to life support. Aside from killing off two other good Department store chains, the store itself is great. From the older country logo to the Supercenter, it has a huge selection of bargain-priced merchandise, from video games to clothes to food (in the awesome SuperCenters!). I hate the fast food branches in most SuperCenters were closed down (such as McDonald's and Taco Bell), but Wal-Mart rules, pure and simple.
