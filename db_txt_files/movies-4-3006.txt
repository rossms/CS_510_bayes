This was a movie I hadn't expected to enjoy and was pleasantly surprised. The premise of the detective tracking down a murderer in Alaska while suffering from insomnia is interesting. While the film does tend to drag sometimes, for the most part it is compelling and suspenseful. Al Pacino is terrific and Robin Williams is shockingly good at playing the antagonist for once. The supporting cast is quite talented also including Hilary Swank and Maura Tierney. Filled with plot twists and a terrific ending, this film is definitely worth seeing.
