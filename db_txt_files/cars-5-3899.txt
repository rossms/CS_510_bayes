We've had ours for more than a year now, and I must say I have never before had a vehicle that was absolutely flawless as delivered. Plenty of power, decent mileage, uses regular gasoline, room to spare. I don't think you can make this tank rattle, whatever the road. Clonversely, my son's new Tahoe began rattling about the time it first hit the road and the interior fittings look cheap; plus the motor's noisy.
