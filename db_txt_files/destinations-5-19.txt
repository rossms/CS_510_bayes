I was going to say the city is mystical,magical and mysterious-only to find the same adjectives have already been applied.It may come as a culture shock to some,but i found the place an unforgettable adventure.Worth going over the high snowcapped Atlas mountains,deeper into the country,and The Ourika valley is also lovely.
