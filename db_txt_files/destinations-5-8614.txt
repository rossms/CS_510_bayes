grizzly wintergreen is by far the best flavored wintergreen chew on the market and its so cheap. the only recommendations i would have to the company is they should make apple and maybe vanilla . also i heard you can get a metal can top for grizzly. if anyone knows where i can get this i would appreciate a call at 920-388-3305 ask for doug jr. thanks
