Los Angeles is like no other place on Earth. I have always liked L.A. The people are almost perfectly odd. Unlike other reviewers on this website, I have never really met a really rude person in the city, in fact I was always treated good by most strangers I have met there. People always seem to be willing to help. I guess I am just going to those rare neighborhoods...who knows? Los Angeles definately deserves 4 stars. It would have been a 5 star city if it wasn't for the nasty, purple looking sky...just dreadful smog..horrid...
