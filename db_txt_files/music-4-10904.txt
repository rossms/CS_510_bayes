I am really not a pop fan and I think Mandy Moore definitely falls into the same category as Britney Spears and Christina Aguilera (who I dislike greatly). Yet I found Moore's track, I Wanna Be With You, sweet and simple. That's the best way I would describe it. I would buy the CD just for that track.
