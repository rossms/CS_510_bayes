If you don't like the taste of beer, it's probably cause you have never tried Sam Adams or any other truly premium beer. As Far as mainstream beers (outside microbrews), Sam Adams is the better choice. A beer drinkers beer. Summer Ale has a lemen touch that gives it a crispness and thus easier to drink. Filling but not over-filling, yet refreshing. I'm a true beer drinker, and thus can't stand cheap beer. Give Sam Adams a try, either regular lager, or seasonal, Octoberfest isn't that bad either.
