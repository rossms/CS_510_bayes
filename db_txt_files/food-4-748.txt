I enjoy a bowl of Kellogg's Corn Flakes every morning myself. They go well with milk, and are easy to find in off-brand versions that are just as good. There is no discernable difference between Corn Flakes by Kelloggs or by any other company, but I still buy Kelloggs. It is good and reasonably priced.
