One of my favorite stores. They usually have cute clothes and the shirts and jeans are very good quality, but their skirts, the seams at the top always fall apart after washing them. They have great underwear and jewelry. At Express, it seems like they always have seasons where they have alot of cute clothes, and seasons where everything is boring and too corporate. But overall, it's a good store.
