This is the best so far as features. It has recently been closing itself on random though. I don't know why. Just a little bug. It has multiple tab browsing and functions and looks like Netscape7. It basically is the same. It has alot of security built in and it actually tells you how secure the site is and you have more autofill options. You cna tell it to remember sitewide,yes,no, or never. It also renders webpages really niceley.
