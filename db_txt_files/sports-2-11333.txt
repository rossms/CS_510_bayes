Anyone who thinks Mack is a good recruiter is an idiot?? Ok.. throw just about every football analyst into the idiot barrel. Texas produces tons of NFL talent, and is in the top 5 in THE NATION recruiting every year (notice I'm comparing their classes to a wider base than just A&M's classes). There is no reason why he should not be able to stay within at least 40 or 50 points of OK. Whoever takes MB's place in about 2 years is going to have a hell of a ball of clay to work with.
