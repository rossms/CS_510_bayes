I prefer Baked Lays's over regular Lay's any day of the week. First, I think the Baked ones taste better. They come in regular, BBQ, Sour Cream and Onion, etc. so you can pick a variety that suits your tastes. Second, they aren't greasy at all. I know that people I probably turned off by the sound of Baked potato chips, but give these a shot.
