Love the guy, think he is doing a great job. He is honest, sensitive and real! He is down-to-earth and doing one heck of a job for our country 'cause he cares about our country not about himself. So, the guy's father was President, that should not be held against him. He has proven himself to the USA and to the world. Keep up the good work, President Bush!
