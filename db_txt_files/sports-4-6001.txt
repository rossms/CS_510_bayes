sorry all you north carolina fans out there who thinks jj's a loser. bottom line if the opposing team sticks there best defender on him isn't that respect enough. i realise he's not the athlete mccants is but every great team has a great shooter. for example UCONN rashad anderson, bulls steve kerr, duke jj redick. i sense a patern his defense has improved since coming to duke and by golly watch him burn jackie manuel off the dribble this year
