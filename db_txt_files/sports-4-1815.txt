They lost a lot of quality players in the offseason but they made up for it by getting Tim Hudson, Danny Kolb, Raul Mondesi and Brian Jordan. I expect them to win another divisional title and even make it to the World Series. Anything short of a Fall Classic appearance is inexcusable for this club. If they flop again in the first round or if they don't make the playoffs expect Bobby Cox, Leo Mazzone, and GM John Schuerholz to be on shaky ground.
