If you aren't into analyzing what is actually happening, it was pretty good. It is suspenseful and has enough twists to keep it interesting. The problem is there are parts that don't really go along with the rest of the plot. It seems like the writer started to go with one story line, then changed their mind and went somewhere else without removing all the original plot. And the ending makes no sense at all. They might be trying to set it up for a sequel, but I certainly hope not...
