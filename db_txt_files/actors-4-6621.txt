Hey, hey, the guy is funny as hell. He's a great person, and he's really funny off stage. He's the type of guy you'd want to be around. His acting is very good. I liked the way he acted in Mickey Blue Eyes though the movie was kinda boring, I survived through it because he was in it. If I'd see him pass by me on the street, I'd tell him to keep up the good job. :) Good Day!
