I have been a soundgarden fan for years. I know Cornell is an excellent singer and songwriter and has been an inspiration for me and my music. Anyone who is a true fan and appreciates music will tell you that his solo album is as good as any soundgarden album before it. Rock on Chris Cornell and god bless you!
