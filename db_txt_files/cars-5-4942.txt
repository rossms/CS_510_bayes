Need a truck with a great amount of power, space, comfortability, and cleanliness? Try the '04 Cummins Diesel, quad-cab, long bed. The truck looks great, drives great, and gets me about 23 mpg on city and highway! Oh, by the way, 0 problems, and if there are any, there's a warranty on the Ally Tranny! Eat our DUST, Ford Lovers! Our truck only costed us $33,500 out the door!
