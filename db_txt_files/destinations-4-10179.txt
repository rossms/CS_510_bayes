Marlboro lights are pretty good. They are mild, smooth, and not to harsh on the thoat. I switch between Parliament Lights and Marlboro Lights pretty often. I like Parliaments taste better but they burn much faster. I also am not a fan of the way the Marlboro filter gets moist. I enjoy swimming and running in Manhattan and neither of these brands makes me feel sick or unhealthy.
