Cape Cod is amazing - from the weirdness of Provincetown to the locals only feel of Buzzards Bay, Cap Cod has some serious character. My favorite beach is Welfleet, located about 3/4 of the way down the cape - about 20 minutes from provincetown. The thing that stands out about this beach are the huge dunes. While it can be a pain to trudge up after a long day in the sun, it sure is fun to roll down. There is also a cool little bar called the Beachcomber there that gets some pretty good live music. Let's hope that the Cape is able to preserve its undeveloped feel...
