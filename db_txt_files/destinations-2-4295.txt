If you are rich, this is one of the best cities in the U.S. to live in. If you are poor or middle class, it is one of the worst. Positives: weather (no winter!), proximity to beach, some great universities such as UCLA and USC, lots of jobs compared to other cities, and tons of culture Negatives: pollution, traffic, expensive, overcrowded, gangs/crime, homelessness/poverty
