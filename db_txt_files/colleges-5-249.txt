The program is excellent in preparing students for the real world by building communication skills through team projects and presentations and by the professors' experience in the business world. I gleaned so much valuable information from them because I was able to form lasting relationships with them due to the class sizes, which were about 20-22 students per class. They also give good scholarships, which helps reduce the investment of capital up front. I found the experience in Malibu to be an enriching one, which I will always look back on fondly.
