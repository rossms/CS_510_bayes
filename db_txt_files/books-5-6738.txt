I just want to second what everyone else has said, except that I'd stop reading before the last book ( Mostly Harmless ). That was a downer, but all the rest of them were the most hilarious things I've ever read. And yes, I like Python, but you don't have to. It's the writing style that gets me, maybe a bit like Dave Barry's.
