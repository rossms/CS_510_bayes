Wow. What an amazing cd! From top to bottom, SOAD had me with every drum beat and every riff! There's hard (which makes up most of the cd), there's soft (Aerials) and then there's mixture of the two (Chop Suey, ATWS) Awesome cd, I recommend it to anyone and everyone ... well anyone and everyone that likes hard rock.
