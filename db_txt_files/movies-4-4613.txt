I really liked this movie and thought that Miss Honey and Matilda both were adorable. I think that all kids old enough to understand this film will enjoy it, because Matilda is able to get some sweet revenge on her rotton parents (played by Rhea Pearlman and Danny Devito) and the god-awful principal of her school.
