Nobody ever eats at that restaurant anymore. It's too crowded! ha ha ha Because of his Yogi-isms, people don't realize what a great player he was. When Casey Stengel was asked to name the single finest athlete he ever coached among the Yankees, he said that all-around, Yogi Berra was the best. I used to hate the Yankees, but couldn't help liking this colorful character and outstanding player.
