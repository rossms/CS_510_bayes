First I would like to say that B N is my favorite out of the large chain bookstores. The atmosphere is always very welcoming, the staff at any location I have ever been to is always real down to earth and friendly. Friendly staff is a huge issue I have with the other chains. Not only that, but unlike the other book store chains, Barnes and Noble is probably the only one where you can meet decent guys. Meeting a guy at a bookstore is 100% better than meeting a guy at a bar. Trust me......
