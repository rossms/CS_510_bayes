I like coke, but I prefer pepsi. Coke has a little too much bite for me, and pepsi is smoother. The thing I really like about coke though, is that there is an old fashioned soda fountain kind of place near where I live, and you can get all kinds of flavored coke! You can get the origionals like cherry and vanilla coke, but you can also get orange, grape, and even chocolate coke! It is sooooo good!
