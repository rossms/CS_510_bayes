I am a huge college basketball fan and Kirk Hinrich is by far my favorite player to watch. His style is so old school. Of all the points going this year, I think he is going to have the best career in the NBA because he is a smart player, unselfish on the court, in a few years he is going to be MVP on a very lucky team. I've read the rumors though and I don't want to see him in a Bucs Jersey!!
