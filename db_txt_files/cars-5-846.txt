I have ridden this bike for several years. It is a bulletproof cc bike that climbs like the best. The bike is not a downhill wonder but with 5 of active travel (when seated) the bike is amazing for epics. Add to the fact that it weighs 25#, when everyone these days are riding bomp proof 34# bikes. This bike is a classic for the fluid cc rider. Don't stand up and throw it around, it wasn't designed or that. Just update the front fork to 1 of the many awesome units out there, stay in th saddle and peddle,peddle, peddle.
