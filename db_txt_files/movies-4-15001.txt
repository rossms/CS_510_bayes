Based on the real life of the con artist Frank Abagnale jr who had pulled off more cons before he reached the age of 18 than anyone in history. Terrific performance by Leonardo DiCaprio. His charisma was perfect for the role. Christopher Walken and Tom Hanks are excellent in their roles. Not only is their a human element to this movie, but it is highly entertaining. An amazing true story, some of the stuff Mr Abagnale pulled will blow your mind.
