Look at the people that Bush surrounds himself with. Dick Cheney, Colin Powell, John McCain (to an extent) and Rudy Giuliani. Smart, respected individuals that we can feel confident with. Also when Bush wins, maybe whiners like Barbra Streisand, Alec Baldwin, Tom Hanks Robert Altman WILL leave the country. That can only make the USA a better place to live without those bleeding heart phonies.
