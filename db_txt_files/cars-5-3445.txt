This is an almost-perfect small SUV. Great handling, mileage and reliability -- Toyota hallmarks -- carry through on the RAV4. If you live anywhere 4WD is helpful (or in MN, necessary!), this is a fantastic vehicle. Rear seating and cargo room are small, so keep that in mind. Quality and reliability all the way through.
