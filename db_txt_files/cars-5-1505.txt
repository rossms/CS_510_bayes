I own not one, but TWO Pontiac Vibes, and love both of them. The first was 2003, and then a month later, we got a 2004. I'm completely confident sending my teenaged (driving) daughter out in sub-zero temperatures to school in this car, it handles perfectly on ice and snow and over all is simply FANTASTIC. I would buy two more, so every driver in our family would have one, if I could!
