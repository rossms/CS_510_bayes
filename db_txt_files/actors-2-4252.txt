He might be very likeable in a dorky sort of way, but he is not an actor, and no one should ever put him in charge of anything so important as a 200 million dollar action sci-fi flick (you know the one I mean). He may have a great goofy smile, but he sucks at acting and I am only going to suspect the intelligence of anyone who willingly converts to the Church of Scientology. Don't email me and tell me I'm wrong about the CoS, because you will never convince me that there is anything legitimate about those heartless scam artists.
