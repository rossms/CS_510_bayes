I am so sorry that the "No Sugar" was taken off the box. The new boxes are nice. I recently bought a box of shreddies and when I wen to eat them, they were so sweet I threw them in the garbage. Now I have to read the side pannel of every box to make sure I get one with no sugar as I am diabetic. It would be so nice to see the "No sugar added" back on the boxes that it applies to. J
