This was one of those movies that poser kids at high school went apeshit over so I avoided it. Then one day I saw the book and decided to read it (it was excellent, by Anthony Burgess) My guess is that it would have been an extraordinarily difficult book to transfer verbatim to the screen. Kubrick did a good job in establishing the edgy, post-modern feel that the book had. The devices used to develop character and motivate plot differ between books and movies, although I do wonder what Burgess thought of the movie himself.
