I also got one for xmas and its brought me great joy. i listen to music when i sleep, on the road, waiting in lines its great! it fits in my pocket. Ive transfered over 50 cd's onto it and its not even half way filled. im actually having a race with a friend as to who has more songs. im currently winning 3,789 to 3,000 something. i encourage everyone that enjoys listening to music to buy one!
