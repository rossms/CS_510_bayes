If you gave him under 5 stars then there is something srong with you. You either have never seen the guy play, you hate him, or you might just be mentally retarted. All you have to do is see this guy play a game and you will agree that he is amazing. One of the best players I ahve seen since Barry Sanders. Easily 5-stars plus Heisman Trophy winner 2005.
