(assuming i've got the right model here) exactly what i wanted. love how it comes with rechargeables and is itself the charger. hasn't failed me yet, and is great on power considering the air traffic controller headphones i've got hooked up to it. yeah, it skips a bit when you're jostling it around, i can deal with that. do yourself a favour and get the remote!
