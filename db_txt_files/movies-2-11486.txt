This inoffensive romantic comedy will have its audience, but it's rather short on substance and I had trouble liking the lead characters. It was never clear to me why Jennifer Lopez's character liked Matthew McConaughey's, and vice versa. Each does a couple dispicable things in the course of the movie that soured me on the whole thing. I wound up having the most sympathy for the Italian guy played by Kevin Pollack. Not a bad video rental if you want a lightweight romantic comedy, but otherwise steer clear of this one.
