I have a 2001 Pathfinder LE 4x4. This is the best SUV on the road in the 30k price range, and drove them all. My old '95 Explorer was an okay vehicle but not in the same league as the Pathy. The new for 2001 240 hp engine is impressive and the 6 CD stereo is awesome! Handles like a car, off roads like a mountain goat. Toyota has got some catching up to do. I'm very pleased.
