About four years ago, I bought a Denon AVR receiver to anchor a home theater system (Sony TV; Infinity front, center, and surround speakers; Energy sub-woofer; and JVC VCR). The performance of the Denon has been excellent. I've never had a single problem with it. When I'm watching sports on TV, I feel like I'm at the game, and when I'm watching a movie where something explodes, my coffee table shakes. A while back I went to a movie at a second-rate theater, and I after a loud car chase scene I realized the sound in my living room was better.
