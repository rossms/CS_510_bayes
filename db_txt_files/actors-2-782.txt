Maybe it is just me but I wouldn't place Phoenix here as a classic actor. Maybe he could be put on a DEAD actors list but being dead doesn't make you a good actor or a classic actor. He doesn't belong on this list with so many great actors of the past. he only had 15 actual movie roles and several of those were at a very young age. He may have had talent but he barely did anything and doesn't qualify as a classic actor to me.
