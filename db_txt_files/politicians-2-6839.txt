In Mississippi, Trent is known as Not-A-Lot . I can't say that I disagree with that assessment considering the trouble that his stupid comments made for the Republican Party. A senate majority leader should have known better and held his tongue and his nose at a testimonial for the old Dixiecrat. Not a very good politician.
