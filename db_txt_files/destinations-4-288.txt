My son is quitting his job in the U.S. and going to live in Wellington, NZ for one year. He is in the journalism field, but he says he doesn't want to sit at a computer for one year. He already has his work visa and airline tickets. He's 28 and single. Do you think he'll like it. He's a real gypsy. His stepday and I are planning to go and visit him. We live in the U.S.
