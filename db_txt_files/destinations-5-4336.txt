I have lived all across these United States and I can tell you, there is no place like Los Angeles. There is something for everyone. So many interesting neighborhoods and towns. Great food, lots to do from skiing, surfing and hiking. Excellent shopping. The club seen is great. Some of the people can be shallow, but I found most of the folks to be quite nice. More cars than any city in the world with jammed freeways constantly, but I got around ok. My favorite places: Santa Monica, West Hollywood, Pasadena, West L.A., Beverly Hills, and the new downtown Hollywood. The weather is great. I just love L.A.
