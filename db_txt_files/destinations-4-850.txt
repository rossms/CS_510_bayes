I spent the summer in Canada once, and liked it a lot, except for one thing: so many Canadians want to run down America. I went out of my way to speak well of their country, but they kept making negative remarks about America. Not long before I left, I asked a good friend up there what they have against us, because they always said they liked me personally, just not Americans in general. This friend said, I'll tell you the honest reason: we tend to feel inferior when we compare our country to yours. I told her that she (and everyone else up there) shouldn't feel that way, because Canada is a great place.
