Because I feel that Coca Cola is definately an all around American tradition, I think this place is awesome. I don't necessarily like Coca Cola better than Pepsi, actually I love Pepsi moreso...but I still think this is a must see. I still wished they would put soft drinks back in their glass bottles instead of these plastic bottles they have out now...the cola never stays cold enough..ugh
