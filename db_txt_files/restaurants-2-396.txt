Sorry have to rate wendys a 2 but i've been getting bad chicken tenders there. The tenders are always hard and dry. no matter what time of the day i go they are always bad. I called today a talked to the manger she said the next time i came in i could get a order for free but who is to say that it will be fresh and that someone won't do some thing to it. thank you for your time janeine cahall
