I have grown up with McDonald's. In high school, the band always located a McDonald's when we were traveling. The food was filling and fit our pocketbooks. When my children were toddlers, I couldn't pass the golden arches without their knowledge and they loved the playground equipment. Now, I love the grilled chicken California Cobb salad, I substitute the balsamic vinagrette dressing and I am so happy. It is inexpensive and hits the spot when I need a quick lunch or light meal.
