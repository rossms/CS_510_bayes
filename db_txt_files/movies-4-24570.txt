Cheesy and breezy, here's a flick no one admits to having seen (but with enough badgering, they'll provide unerring detail at length). Terrible right on down the line, you can still spot SO much of it in sci-fi stuff over the last 25 years. Jane Fonda's zero-G strip tease keeps zonkifying even at this jaded juncture (and the brief bit of backside is permanently etched into the freeze-frame chapter zoom of my DVD player). Three heaves for an endearing embarrassment!!!
