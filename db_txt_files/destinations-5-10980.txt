A great place for families. It's small, but VERY clean. The lines were short; we rode the two big wooden coasters at least 3-4 times each and didn't miss the rest of the park either! The water park is awesome too, and the two wooden coasters are among the best! My kids, 9 and 12, pick it over Six Flags Kentucky Kingdom and Kings Island which are about the same distance from us. Oh...and the price--it's a bargain as far as theme parks go, and they have free, unlimited soft drinks as well.
