One word: Amazing. They produce such crisp clear music you could swear you have the best set of headphones ever produced by any company. They are exceptionally comfortable with rubber padding and with the right adjustments sit firmly and steadily along your ears. I've tried them out on computers, Ipods, radios, and cd players alike, and nothing but pure astonishment on how they perform. Only set back is if you wear glasses with them on, but with the proper adjustments you'll be good to go, and the same if you decide to take the sunglasses off. Over and out! -AkMadness
