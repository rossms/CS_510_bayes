Will Smith was never seen as a crime fighter until Bad Boys. But this movie set him above the rest. Bad Boys was good in its entirety, but he was able to bring humor and screen presence to at kind of horror type film. This movie could have just been another alien flick if Smith didn't pop in his one lineres and smart aleck remarks.
