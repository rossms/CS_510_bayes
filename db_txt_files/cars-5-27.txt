I LOVE THIS QUAD!!! I just got it about a month and a half ago. My b/f will most likely race this quad instead of his Honda TRX 250R, if for no other reason than THIS QUAD FLIES!!! The ONLY thing that bothered me at first about the quad was the thumb throttle and how tough it is on you on long rides. But I am getting used to it. Hey Raptorman89 - I take it that you live in PA? I just learned of Rauch Creek yesterday - how is it?
