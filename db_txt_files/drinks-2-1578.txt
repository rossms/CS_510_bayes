Schoofers. I used to steal cases of this off of my bluecollar neighbors' back porches when I was a kid back in the 1960s. It was poisonous swill with a petrochemical aftertaste back then, so I imagine it's probably worse now that it's not even made by the original brewery. I guess I would try it, however, for nostalgia's sake.
