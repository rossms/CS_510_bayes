The best candy bar out there no doubt about it! Twix has a taste that could best be described as luxuriant without being ostentatious. In other words, Twix is sweet without being overly so. Twix are also wholesome and filling. I like the crunchy cookie centre! I could eat ten Twix bars without getting sick of the taste. By comparison, I can only stomach one Oh Henry! bar before the sugar gets to my head.
