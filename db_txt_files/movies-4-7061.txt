I just watched this movie tonight for the first time in at least 8 or 9 years. It's probably Mel Brooks' funniest movie. The whole cast- manic Gene Wilder, grotesquely funny Peter Boyle, cute, naive Terri Garr, deadpan Cloris Leachman, offbeat, incoherent Kenneth Mars and the late Marty Feldman and Madeline Kahn- all turn in great, hilarious performances. It runs out of steam a little towards the end, but overall it's still one of the damn funniest movies I've ever seen, and it certainly holds up after thirty years.
