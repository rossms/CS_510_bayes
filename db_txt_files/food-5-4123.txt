These must be the tastiest snacks ever! They have just the right amount of cheese flavor, they don't get you orange all over (as much as Cheetos) and they're just crunchy enough. What I like to do is leave the bag open for a few hours before eating which makes them much more crispy. These snacks just taste so good, I want to eat them every week.
