Israel is a great country,too bad it is controled by army generals insted of civilians.The diference is that army generals think only of war games and how to use the armed forces to atchieve security,on the other hand a civilian leader meaning a person from people with a political backgroud,could probably find different ways to accomplish security.Now Israel spends approxemetly about 10 billion dollars on the millitary,can you even begin to imagin what would that money make to improve our living and beautify our country and may be even better security with our nabours.
