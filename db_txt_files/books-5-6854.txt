TANSTAAFL! This is one of his best dissertations on sociopolitical science with a liberal dose of free enterprise and revolutionary spirit! Eric's reccommendations are good I will add Friday and any of the Lazarus Long stories to the reccommended read list. I have so many favorites, its hard to choose!
