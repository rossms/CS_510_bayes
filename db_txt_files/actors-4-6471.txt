Billy Bob Thornton has his own unique style which makes him an above average actor. His characters are very believable- espescially with his performance in Sling Blade . I've never been disappointed with a performance that Thornton has given. He was excellent in Armageddon , Primary Colors , A Simple Plan and Pushing Tin . And this year he'll be playing Davy Crockett in the film The Alamo - I can't wait to see that. In the final analysis- Billy Bob Thornton is a very gifted actor but he's not one of the best.
