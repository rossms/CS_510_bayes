I read this book a while ago. I read it right before the movie came out. I really liked it. I knew Tom Cruise was playing the main character so I always pictured his face as the main character which fit the description well. The story was very suspenseful and kept me turning the pages. The story is about a corrupt law firm and how they invade into the main characters (I forget his name)life. It is a good book and the movie does the book justice.
