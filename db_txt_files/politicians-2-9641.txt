LBJ is actually a bit difficult to rate. He would not have become president if not for the Kennedy assassination, and probably wouldn't have been re-elected if not for the country still reeling from that tragedy. Johnson said he would not take us full force into Vietnam when running for his own term, and one of the first things he did once elected was take us full force into Vietnam. Although I rate him low, I will add that some strides made in civil rights might not have happened if not for some of his actions.
