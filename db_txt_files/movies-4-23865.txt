I feel bad giving it four stars because it has nothing to do with the game. Resident Evil is one favorite games and I was hoping for the movie version, god that would have been great! Well this was good, but half the people just got cut into pieces by a lazor, and it wasnt gory at all. They could have done much better with it. Recommended to see at mid-night.
