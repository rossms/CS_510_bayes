Simply the best fighting game ever. It has some of the coolest characters around (Mario, Jigglypuff, Yoshi, Pikachu, Kirby and more!), great levels, fun items, a few different play modes, awesome graphics and great sound. Forget those dreadful gory bloodfests and look for Nintendo to bring you this great game! The sequel to this game (Super Smash Brothers Melee) is the main reason I will purchase a Nintendo GameCube soon!
