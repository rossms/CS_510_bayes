I think Ainge's moves especially losing Eric Williams have been average to poor. I think Jim O'Brien saw this and my guess is he would not put up with it. How can he run the show if he doesn't know who the players will be. Only time will tell. As a fan I always hope for the best but this I don't know about. Was Ainge really a Celtic!
