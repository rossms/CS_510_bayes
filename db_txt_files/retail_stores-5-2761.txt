Love it! Although it not the cheap place to shop, they have wide variety of different jewelry styles, including extensive watch collection, Mikimoto pearls, David Yurman jewelry, and their Toscano collection which is incredible. The have a very nice color stones and pearls collection. Sales people are happy to help you. For my experience it is one of the friendliest jewelry store.
