I never understood why so many people found this movie hilarious. GRanted, John and Dan were great as comedic actors. However, this never appealed to me as being one of the strongest creations to come from SNL or their actors. The mission just seemed to drag on. The only scene I found hilarious was when they drove the car through the shopping center. Other than that, this is a movie that gets more credit than what it deserves.
