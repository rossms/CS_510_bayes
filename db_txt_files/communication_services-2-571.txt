I live and work in Harrisburg, PA area. T-Mobile's services is poor here. It frequently cuts out while traveling, even just around the city. Even worse is my home - I don't get a good signal at all and I'm told by T-Mobile that I live in an area where service may or may not work. Even so, they won't let me out of my contract because I can still get service - poor or not.
