A very satisfying family movie that has something for both the kids and parents. The story is somewhat similar to The Incredibles in that you don't have to have Super Powers to be a hero. Good performances from Kurt Russell and Bruce Campbell, but the two members (Foley and McDonald) from the ever-ubiquitous Kids in the Hall steal the show. I also loved the 80's based soundtrack.
