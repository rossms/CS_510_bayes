i like this kind of frozen dinner. it really does taste homemade, and it cooks pretty well in the microwave. what i dont like is the chicken fried steak meal because the corn is on a cob which is annoying because then you have to pick up the hot, wet, corncob just to eat it. and if you cut then it just slides around. the chicken alfredo is very good though.
