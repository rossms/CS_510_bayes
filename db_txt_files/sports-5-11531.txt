9-3 Season at Washington State, and a win over Texas in the Holiday Bowl? Not too shaby. Some people may attribute this season to Mike Price, but it was the Defense that carried Wazzu, and that Defense was built by Doba. If Doba can prove that 03' was a norm and not a miracle, he will be up among the greats.
