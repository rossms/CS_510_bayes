simply the best college basketball program of all time. The statistics back it up, and they have the best fan support in colege basketball. Also look at their scheduel every year, they do not dodge anyone, yet they are always in the top 10, or in the running for the championship. Unlike Someone like Duke, who plays 1 or 2 tough games before the ACC, and will not play anyone out of conference on their home court. Its either at Cameron indoor or a nutural site.
