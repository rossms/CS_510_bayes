Once you go elsewhere in the world away from the East Coast of the USA, you will learn that all other cheese puufs, whether they be cheetos, cheesy-poofs, or some no-name brand are simply pale imitations of this finest example of the combination of salt, cheese, and poofiness. I MISS my cheez doodles and must order more from Wise. Wise, btw, will DELIVER them to you in bulk if you order from them online! SAVED!!
