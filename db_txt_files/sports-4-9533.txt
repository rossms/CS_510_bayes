This team will be a major force, but not quite yet. They have a lot of developing to do and the addition of Larry Brown will make all of the difference. Joe Dumars does an outstanding job in the front office at putting together a great TEAM, but seems to be willing to sacrifice a proven go-to-man (i.e Stackhouse for Hamilton trade).
