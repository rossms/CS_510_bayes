I love Raisin Bran but I don't really know how much I love it because I just go through the box, eat all the sugary raisins and then leave the bran flakes. It makes for a really annoying habit for the person who wants a bowl of Raisin Bran after I have picked through it and it is only Bran. Believe me, I've heard the complaints. The remaining bran flakes sit in the cabinet until I eventually throw the box away.
