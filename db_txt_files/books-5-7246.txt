This is one of the greatest science fiction books of all time - and I've been reading S.F. for almost 40 years. It is the pinnacle of Iain M Banks' Culture series and it's very hardcore S.F. so if you find it too much, try one of his earlier works, there are 8 others available under the Iain M. Banks name (he also writes as Iain Banks but they're not S.F.). They are all brilliantly written - don't let the covers put you off. Banks' imagination is breath-taking, his writing masterful and his vision inspiring.
