I read some comments saying Bird lacked defense; is that why he made two all-defensive teams in one of the deepest eras in basketball history? He had it all, and in his early days in the league he could even throw down some nasty reverse dunks. People forget now, but his back problems took away a lot of his athleticism. If I had to compare his athletic ability to a player today, I would say Chris Bosh. Bosh even dunks the same as Bird did in the early days.
