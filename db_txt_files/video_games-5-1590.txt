The only problem with this game is that the difficulty levels haven't changed that much (the rookie level is still too easy and the pro level is still just has hard). Other than that the game is great, and is a big improvement with the add ins (half-time show, gang tackles, pre-season, training camps, etc.) The game visually still looks as great or better than the last one. Madden never fails to deliever.
