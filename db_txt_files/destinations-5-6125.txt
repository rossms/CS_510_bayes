Kentucky is a beautiful state. Loaded with mountains,lush scenery, lakes, rivers and creeks; all of this plus only 8 hours from the Atlantic Ocean make it a great place to live and visit. Kentucky is also less than 7 hours from Lake Michigan and has more interstate waterways than any other state in the USA. Getting to enjoy all 4 seasons is a real plus and all this makes Kentucky a top 5 state in my book!
