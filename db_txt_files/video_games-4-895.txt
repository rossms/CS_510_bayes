A pretty good game. Our family enjoys playing on occasion. It is kind of fun to see what kind of money we will be making and what career we draw. As we go over the board we could end up getting married and see how many kids we end up with. At any given moment Life can change and you may have to trade salaries with another player. It is interesting to see how Life can change with the throw of a dice or a draw of a card. It has been around sice I was a kid.
