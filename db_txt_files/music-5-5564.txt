How many bands can pull off such a great, classic, hard rock album during an emotional rebound from a tragic loss such as the passing of their lead singer (Bon Scott) in all of one year? Apparently this band did and it's such a fitting tribute album to Scott. Brian Johnson was a very wise choice for a replacement.
