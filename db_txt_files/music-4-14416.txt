Had they included the stirring end credits song on this soundtrack, it would have gotten five stars. Instead, they released a second volume of music (I can't stand it when they do that!) The music on this CD, as was the case with the movie, is made up of beguiling covers by the actors. And they do a great job--Ewan McGregor's voice is nearly operatic, and Nicole can sing too. The one original piece on the CD--Come What May--is gorgeous. But again, where is that end titles instrumental?
