Jennifer Aniston is one of the VERY few girls I I can stand on network television. I like all the characters in Friends, but I honestly think she carries a lot of the show. She's funny without being obnoxious. I like her looks too lately the beauty ideal for television starlets seems to be a girl with hollowed-out bony cheeks and a micheal-jackson nose. But back to the subject, I'm only gonna rate her a four cause she's good on TV but not so great on the silver screen.
