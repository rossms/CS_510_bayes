Flutie was by far the superior qb for the bills and i am really disappointed that wilson picked his little injury prone johnson. comparatively speaking, wins count, and half way through the season when the bill are scrambling for a replacement qb (only scrambling you'll likely see this year at the qb position) I'll be somewhere else cheering for flutie. regards. tk
