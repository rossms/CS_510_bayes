I have just bought a new 2006 artic cat 650 H1 300 miles so far great ground clearance good ride great power and starts with no problem in the cold alberta canada weather. I am running 27 12 12 bear claw tires and have had no problem, shifts great and goes in and out of 4x4 with ease. I have always had grizzlys before 600 and 660 but yamaha did not build a new machine so I have switched to Cat. LOVE IT
