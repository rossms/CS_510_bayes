I like Maureen O,Hara. She usually played strong women. who could take care of themselves. I liked the way she could stand up for herself {in her roles} without losing her femininity. She was good in Miracle on 34th Street, Parent Trap, and McClintock.I just saw her in a tv movie and she is just as good as ever.
