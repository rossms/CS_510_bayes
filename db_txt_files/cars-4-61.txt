HYE RAPTORMAN n POOPY- I have to agree with raptormadn.ALL KALASKI`S SUCK!!!! I race the kfx`s 700 in the open class and My honda TRX450R blows em away.KFX`s suck for one reason they r auto matic and they r 2 heavy and u can bearly find parts for them.Raptors u can get anything 4!!!The only thing with the 660`s r they have 2 much powere 4 guys.For trail ridding they r great racin ur beeter off witha a 450 or 400 or somethin like that.I know guys who ride raptor 350 better than 660s!!!
