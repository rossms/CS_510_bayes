Anyone who calls Colorado's politics as 'progressive' is living in a nether world of total confusion- unless you want to call right wing reactionary 'progressive' that being so the state has some wonderful scenary and a great city in Denver- the rest of the state is not progressive- but borders on ultra far right-which IMO mars it greatly.
