ummmmm.....Who rated this a children's book? This is not a children's book by any means. Anyway, this book is definitly a very interesting and informal book. This book also has a lot of real life reminders in it, because I compare the gangs in here to some of the gangs they have in America's bigger cities. Overall, a very good book for young adults or mature pre-teens written by an author that has written many masterpieces in his time.
