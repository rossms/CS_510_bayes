pretty good. we have only been there for a few times. it is a popular restaurant since it is near theaters. they have some good steak and chicken dishes. they offer peanuts with every meal to munch on while you wait for your dinner. {at least they did the last time we went there} reasonably priced. quite a few items to choose from.
