It is called a discount airline, but it reminds me of how pleasurable flying used to be. They actually serve food on flights, the seat pitch is nice, with more leg room, and to be able to fly nonstop somewhere these days is fantastic. Most B737's I have flown on are cattle cars, but the Airbus has more seat space. They do tend to change flight times more than I would like. Overall, I would be willing to pay a little extra to fly on a comfortable airplane non-stop.
