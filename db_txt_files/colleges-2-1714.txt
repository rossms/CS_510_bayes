NYU, like BU or GW, is basically a sidewalk school (without much of a campus), which is fine if you care more about being in the City than being in college . Tisch is great for musical theater and drama. The film school is the best. NYU is great for applied mathematics and Art History, but most of the other departments in the College of Arts Sciences are second rate.
