The first few minutes I thought, Oh jesus, what have I gotten myself into here. But it slowly draws you in and before you know it, you're captivated. Also, that kind of access is unheard of. So, even if it is boring at times, you can't help but think how cool it is that you are borderline spying on Metallica. And I thought Lars came across as a prick. All he does is judge and talk about egos when it's obvious his ego outsizes them all. Inner emotions - I feel like - healthy relationships- blah blah. Stop being p*ssies and play some rock n roll.
