I love Gevalia's coffee. However I never got my shipments when I was supposed to. Their bills would have a pay by date. If you had a shipment to go out before the bill was due they would hold it.They could never give me a definite ship date. If anyone out there has another source for their coffee please let me know.I will never buy directly from them again!
