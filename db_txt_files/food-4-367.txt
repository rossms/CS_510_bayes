Cheerios are good. I remember giving these to my kids as a finger snack food when they were toddlers. They have a good taste to them. and they are not as high in sugar content as some of the other cereals. they are sort of a nostalgia to me since they have been around way before I was born. Kind of up there with apple pie.
