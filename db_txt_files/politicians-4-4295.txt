If he were the Democrat Party's nominee, I would really mull over my vote this November. I respect Lieberman's religious faith and his morals. He's one of the few people in his party whose faith is a hallmark of his character. I'm disappointed he abandoned his positions on school choice and social security privatization upon accepting Al Gore's request to be his running-mate. One must wonder if Lieberman has any regrets, what with Gore endorsing Dean in the primaries, and not even phoning Lieberman to notify him of said endorsement.
