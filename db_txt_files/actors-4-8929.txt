Compared to most female actors in her age bracket, Sandra Bullock is one of the best. All of her movies were good entertainment except Love Potion #9 but every body has to do a funky film when they are getting a foot in the door. I have never left the theater feeling ripped off after seeing one of her movies. To her credit she has not relied on T A to carry her films like some others have. She is a good actress compared to who's out there today.
