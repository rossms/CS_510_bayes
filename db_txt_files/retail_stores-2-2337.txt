I am a very-very long term employee at WinCo. One thing I can say for sure: its a fine place to work until you are sick. Once you have had an illness that causes inconvenience to them the begin looking for reasons to get rid of you. It has not happened to me as I have never given them a reason, but its sure uncomfortable going to work when you know they are hoping for some petty reason to pop up to get you out the door. I've seen it happen but never thought I would be on the receiving end. Stock is great but I think union may be better.
