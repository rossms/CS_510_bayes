NYC is wonderful, the rest of the state seems to be a cross between PA and the great lakes region. Many nice rural areas- and much history. The Finger lakes area is most pretty- with many wineries- The Lake Placid area is great for winter sports and very peaceful and serene. The Hamptons are a great place to visit and live (if you can afford it!) New York is a solid state- but its NYC that is the crowning jewel.
