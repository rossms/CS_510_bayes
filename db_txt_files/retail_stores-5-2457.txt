I shop at the giant in Sterling Virginia and it is wonderful. Everything is immaculate and fresh and the employees are great!! They are friendly and helpful and they appear to actually enjoy their jobs. My one and only complaint is that in the deli, the have hot wings and mac n cheese and potato wedges and they take them down in the late afternoon, they should leave them up all day.
