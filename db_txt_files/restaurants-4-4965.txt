I cannot believe I'm giving this restaurant a high rating. I ordinarily am disappointed in these pseudo-ethnic franchise places. I was invited with a friend and had a wonderful meal. The service was first rate, and the entree I had was delicious. Excellent salad, though the breadsticks resembled something from Fazoli's or Pizza Hut. I would maybe lose them and go more with a home-cooked roll or bread served with olive oil like some other similar places. I definately will go back again though.
