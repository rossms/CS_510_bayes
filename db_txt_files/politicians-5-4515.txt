Alan Keyes is a devoted Christian who stands for the ways of God. I pray he gains power in the government and will continue to run for President until he is put into office. If Alan Keyes continues to stand for the Bible and becomes President, the condition of the United States will change for the better. I believe we as Christians can pull the US out of this moral decline that is tearing us apart. This is not his time, but it is coming. PRAY FOR THE ELECTIONS!!
