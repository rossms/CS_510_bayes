Pats rule! All you detractors didn't take long to jump off the bandwagon. I was in attendance to the least attended game in Pats history, 1000 against the Jets in a snowstorm. On the flip side, I was there for the AFC Championship in 97 and the Snow Bowl in 02. I'll be there no matter what and I wish all you fairweather fans would stay home so I wouldn't have to put up with you getting sick the three times a year you drink. GO PATS!!!!
