Very good movie. Great performances by all of the main characters, particularly Dennis Christopher and Dennis Quaid. Depicts four townie friends living in a college town (Bloomington, IN). All around them are students, with endless opportunity, who will go on to bigger and better things. Conversely, the Cutters (as they are called) are stuck in Bloomington trying to figure out what to do with their lives.
