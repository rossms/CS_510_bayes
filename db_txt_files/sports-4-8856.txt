gary payton better for his team than iverson is so lets not talk about iverson anymore. I think if someone runs around the court all game just to score points than they are not anything special and that is exactly what iverson does just to get points. Gary is a smarter and more fundamentally based guard than iverson and he doesn't need to show boat to get his props. And iverson stop trying to top kobe as the best player in the league work on gary and then step up with the big doggs in LA
