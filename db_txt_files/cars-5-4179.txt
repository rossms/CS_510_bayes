My second Subaru and not my last. Very poor planning on the dashboard..the cup-holders get in the way; but that's my only complaint. Oops, forgot about the 4 cylinder engine. My grandmother could ride a bike up a mountain faster than this car.However, very little mechanical problems with this car, plenty of room; great in bad weather conditions,truly happy with this Outback!
