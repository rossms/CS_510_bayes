This is another place that there is no shortage of in my general area. The one in Gainesville, Texas rules. The food is always fresh, and the service is always very good. Their breakfast items are all great, and for someone on my schedule it's nice to have them start serving their breakfast at 11pm. On the other hand, the other Whataburgers in the area range from average to poor, mostly because the service at them is deplorable. I'll keep it at a four just because I like the one in Gainesville so much.
