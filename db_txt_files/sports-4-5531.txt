This guy is good. I'm a 14 year old girl and I follow basketball very closly. Unlike some of you girls who just watch Kansas, I watch everyone. I absolutely LOVE Kansas but watch some other teams play and then come back and make your opinion. Gardner can make his shots but in my opinion, his talent isn't overwelming like Lebron or 'Melo or HINRICH!
