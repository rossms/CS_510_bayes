A handful of okay beaches and proximity to NYC and Philadelphia are a plus. . .but the toll roads, taxes, and unfriendly-commuter atmosphere (traffic jams, can't pump your own gas) make this state a forgettable experience in the American spectrum. Then again, everyone I've ever met has a strong opinion on Jersey, thus it always seems to be memorable.
