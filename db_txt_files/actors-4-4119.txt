 John Cusack is classic. I love this guy. He isn't the best actor by far but he does a good job and I have liked every character he has portrayed. My all time favorite is Say Anything. He did do some rough ones in the mid to late 80's but he has been making a come back in some great roles in films like Grose Pointe Blank, A Thin Red Line and High Fidelity. He can make me laugh and cry. Pretty good career. I like this guy alot.
