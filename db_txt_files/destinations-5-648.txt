We have visited PV many times. The first time was in 1980 when we camped for two months in our motorhome on Mismaloya beach. (At that time we were on a ten-month trip around North American with our two young daughters.) Sadly, that beach is now totally taken over by a big hotel. We also lived with our nine-year-old daughter in an apartment a block from the beach in the town of Bucerias north of PV for three months in the winter of 1984. Now when we go we try to stay in one of the Mexican style hotels in the old area south of the river. The price is right and the ambience priceless.
