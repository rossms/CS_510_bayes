Classy, elegent, beguiling French actor who was simply one of the world's moost beautiful faces. While she has appeared in many qulity French films, the MooCow's personal favorite remains The Hunger, where she snuggles up to the equally attractive Susan Sarandon - Yowza!!! :=8D Like any true beauty, she has aged well over the years, but has all but vanished from the face of Hollywood. A classic French actress!
