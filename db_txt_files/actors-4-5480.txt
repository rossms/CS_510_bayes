I recently read an article about Mike Meyers which told how difficult he can be for castmates, directors, crew and producers. However, I do think he is pretty entertaining as a comedic actor. I recently saw the Austin Powers movie (I don't even know which one it was), but it was pretty funny. Mike is incredibly versatile, and hilarious as any character he portrays
