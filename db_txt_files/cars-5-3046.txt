There are two cars in the world that I have seen, owned and driven that are more fun, tiptronic twin turbo (996) Porsche and the F1 355 (now 360) Ferrari. But at the cost of an optioned Boxster S, this new ZO6 is a steal and tremendous bargain. Thanks GM - a salute to welcome you back to sport performance was due with the regular C5 Corvette but now. Thanks'
