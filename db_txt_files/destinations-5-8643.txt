10 years dippin and tried everything from Kodiak, Rooster, Skoal and griizly...Oh and if you ever want to quit just slap in a big wad of Husky if you do not throw up first after gettin a wife of that putride smell. Husky has that 100% puke factor once you taste it. After many years of Kodiak, Skoal Apple and Peach are my fav.
