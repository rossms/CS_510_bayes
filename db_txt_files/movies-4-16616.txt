This movie is more sad than it was scary. It was really depressing to watch Robin Williams' character, whose life is so empty that his life's greatest happiness revolves around wanting to be a part of a family that brings their pictures to him to be developed. The whole premise of the movie is depressing and disturbing, yet pretty eery at the same time. I thought it was well done; I enjoyed it.
