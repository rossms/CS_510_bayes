One of my favourite bands, but this is surely the most comercial rather than the best of...? Would Kurt Cobain have approved? I think not. Considering the vast array of unreleased songs available as bootlegs, the one 'new' song offered is VERY poor. IMHO the worst Nirvana song I've heard; released because it fitted in with recent trends rather than because it was a good song. Get a proper Nirvana album. Or the singles boxed set. Or a bootleg. This is a poor reflection of a great band who had FAR more depth than is shown here.
