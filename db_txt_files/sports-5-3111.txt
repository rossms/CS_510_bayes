Mays could not have been "the greatest defensive player in the history of baseball" because the person with that title would almost certainly be a ShortStop, not a Center Fielder. I think Ozzie Smith is the most likely choice for that honor, although Rabbit Maranville is another good possibility. At another position, Bill, "don't slide into Number Nine," Mazeroski dominaed Second Base play the way no one has ever done at any other position. Mays is still one of the few candidates for "greatest player ever" and he did it without being the fastest or strongest player in the game.
