They deserve credit for raising the general public's standards for coffee (in the 80s, before they hit the scene, crappy gas-station-style coffee was the norm.) I can't hold their high prices against them, because it has to be at least partially the fault of the millions of office workers who compulsively line up daily because 1) they're addicted to caffeine, and 2) it's a status symbol.
