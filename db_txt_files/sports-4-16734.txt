As of right now it is 3 days before the 2004 NFL Draft and the Colts offense looks great. Now their defense is a whole other story. They lost their starting CBs and their best linebacker and somehow expect to get away with filling an already porris defense with rookies? They better have something REAL spectacular planned for this offseason that wont cost them cap space or else i just dont see this team being its superbowl-birth-deserving-self it was last year. You never know though with Peyton Manning behind the wheel.
