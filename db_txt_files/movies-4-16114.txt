Undoubtedly one of Kevin Costner's best roles (as Eliot Ness) and an impressive performance by Sean Connery as an honest Irish cop(for which he won an Oscar). Robert De Niro put on an excellent performance as Al Capone(including the segment with the baseball bat where he bludgeons one of his dinner guests to death). The death of Al Capone's henchman Frank Nitty gave a certain amount of satisfaction towards the end of the movie,especially in the way he died. All up,a very entertaining movie,based loosely on actual events.
