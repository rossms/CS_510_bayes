As a resident of Miami, I have a lot of experience with most of the attractions on the Rate-It-All list. To Aventura, I think it's a nice mall in a very nice, rich part of town. They recently renovated the place, adding new restaurants and shoppes that cater to a more richer clientle. If you want really high scale shopping, then go to Bal Harbor. Aventura is where the plebians like myself do their shopping. It's getting higher priced though.
