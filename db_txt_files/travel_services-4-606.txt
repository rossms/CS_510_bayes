I have a mixed review of this city as a whole, some things are better here, some the same, and some are worse. Some aspects of this place I like and others baffle or infuriate me. I'm here due to a complicated private situation with my girlfriend's family that I really can't control, which can be very frustrating at times. The airport here is near perfect though- ample parking, never truly, truly busy, easy to find your way around, and almost invariably your flights are on time.
