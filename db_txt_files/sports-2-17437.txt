Drew and the Buffalo Bills are really lucky to be 4-4 right now, but don't expect any miracles from the mistake-prone Bills. Bledsoe, who has always been overrated, has made some bonehead plays in the red zone this year, and the defense just ain't that good. 7-9 and golf is where these guys will be after this year. Coaching change anyone?
