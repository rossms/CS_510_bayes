Everyone wants to shed a few pounds and this book is not the way to do it. It has some good theories of eliminating white sugar which is mostly food that has little to no nutritional value but cutting fruits and vegatables is ridiculous. If you cut everything Sugar Busters says, of course you'll lose some weight because you can hardly eat anything. It is good for a week or so to just start a healthy diet but as far as any longer than that, it is just insane. It is not a healthy way of life and therefore if you do follow this diet, the weight you lose will just come back.
