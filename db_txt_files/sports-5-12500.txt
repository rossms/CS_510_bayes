Wow, this team has really turned its program around in the past few years. No longer are Jimmy Johnson, drug dealiing, loan-sharking, gambling players/coaches warming the sidelines in Coral Gables. This school has actually been able to maintain a formidable and respectable program. Adding DJ Williams from LaSalle was a plus.
