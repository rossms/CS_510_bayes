I had never seen Worms in action before this version came out, so I can tell you that it's a great way to introduce yourself to the series. So many goofy voice sounds, so little time....and the war action and strategy will keep you hooked for hours upon hours. Only complaint: Sometimes multiplayer battles get a little cheap by resorting to ultra-powerful items ALL the time, or just drowning worms in the water, which kills them instantly. Still, even if your army dies too fast, it's too much fun to pass up.
