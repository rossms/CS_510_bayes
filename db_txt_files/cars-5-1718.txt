I've owned my ZX3(the hatchback) sence july2000 and love it. There is no car in it's price range that compair to it's performance or standard features. It also has a great aftermarket and you can have ANY question about this car answered at www.club-focus.net and check out the Discussion boards!! Look for me and ask away.
