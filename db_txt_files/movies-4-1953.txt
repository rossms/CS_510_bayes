Although Scorsese has done far better work, Cape Fear still remains a great and suspenseful thriller. Far superior to J.Lee Thompson's 1961 remake, Cape Fear is both frightening and entertaining. There have been bad reviews about it, but I disagree. I think it's a worthy enough film. De Niro as Max Cady is one of his great roles, Juliette Lewis is wonderful as the daughter of Sam Bowden (Nick Nolte). Not a classic, but still a pretty damn good film. See it. Summary: AN INTERESTING AND FRIGHTENING FILM, NOT SCORSESE'S BEST WORK THOUGH.
