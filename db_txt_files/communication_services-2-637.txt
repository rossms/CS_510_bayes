I was with Cingular for one week. I did not have any problems calling or receiving calls, but monthly pricing is deceiving. I signed up for a $29.99 per month plan. What I didn't know was that the taxes added up to be $8, so instead of $29.99 per month, it's really almost $40.00 a month for their cheapeast plan.
