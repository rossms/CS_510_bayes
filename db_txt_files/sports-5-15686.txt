Is becoming one of the greatest Linebackers in the NFL. He is also a great person. I had the pleasure to meet him before he became famous. He was so down to earth and seemed gracious that I recognized him. He was not wearing a shirt when I met him, trust me this was a very humbling experience. If I got hit by him I would be a dead man.
