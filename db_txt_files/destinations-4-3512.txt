Ottawa is a great place. Once you get to know it, it's much better than other Ontario cities. Decent restaurants, decent bars, it's bilingual and has an overall good entertainment scene. Very pretty for a city of that size. I find it a bit boring but Canada is a boring place. I noticed that cnadians love to call it that, but forget to mention that places Winnipeg or Clagary are cathedrals of boredom. Hell, Toronto is the capital of boredom. But Montreal rocks, i'd go back there anytime.
