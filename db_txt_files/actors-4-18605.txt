No matter how much I want to, I just cannot bring myself to give George Lucas five stars. He's great at what he does, but I mean, come on, has he really attempted to branch out at all since Indiana Jones or Star Wars . Whereas Spielberg has done a variety of films, George Lucas has never really attempted to try anything else. The jury is still out on who really created Indiana Jones, but Spielberg directed the films so I'm giving him most of the credit. 4 stars for gracing us with the Star Wars Trilogy, but that's really all he's given us in the past 25 years.
