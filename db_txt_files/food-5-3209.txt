My favorites are the chicken fried steak with the gravy, mashed potatoes, and honey glazed carrots. Also the chicken alfredo with broccoli. These meals are under 3.50 and sometimes you can get them cheaper at Kroger or King Sooper's. They are the next thing to being homemade in the line of frozen dinners.
