An assault on the senses. I'm not sure which people watching was better: the women in the windows or the people looking at the women in the windows. The whole place is a trip - a wildly diverse range of people, all kinds of hilarious stores, and an atmosphere of anything goes. If you're easily offended or don't have a sense of humor, steer clear.
