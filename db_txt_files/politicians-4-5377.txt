Al Gore is now my choice. After the third debate I found Bush to be even more scared appearing. If Bush can't even handle something like a debate how can he handle the reins of this country? Al Gore might have seemed stiff in the past but at least he could improve himself over time, which was reflected in the third debate. This shows his ability to deal with adverse conditions and come out ahead. That's my kind of man for the office of president. I feel he can be trusted much more than Bush, no matter what the opposition has said.
