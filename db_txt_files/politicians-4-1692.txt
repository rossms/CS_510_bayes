While I didn't vote for him, he has done a creditable job, and I have liked most of his initiatives so far. That extremists on both sides hate him is generally a good sign. For a political novice, he's shown an amazing ability to learn, and even better he seems to have gotten some intelligent (and bi-partisan) advisors that he actually listens to.
