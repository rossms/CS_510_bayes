When I was in high school ( and even into college), this was the place to be on Friday & Saturday nights. The eclectic decorations and cozy atmosphere made it a great place to hang out. The problem with Bennigan's is that it still is a great place fro high schoolers. I went the other night, and it was full of teenagers. There might have been one other table with anyone over 21!
