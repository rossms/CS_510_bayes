It's the only Pizza Chain that has something good to offer. Though I like thin New York Style Pizza, the Chicago Classic at UNOs is a nice change of pace. The crust has a delicious flavor to it and the toppings are of good quality. They have pretty good buffalo wings too. Unfortunately, some of their other pizzas (like their thin crust) are hit and miss, says my wife. Service at our local restaurant has been marginal.
