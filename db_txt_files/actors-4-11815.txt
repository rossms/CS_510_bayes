An actress who is not only astounding beautiful, but also amazingly can ACT. Shes prooved to many doubters that you can be beautiful and you can have the ability to perform. I don't give a two hoots what she does in her private life as this has nothing to do with the electrifying performances, grace and beauty that this woman conveys on the screen. Shes bought sexiness back to the screens at last. Girl Interrupted was one of her best performances and if you really believe in this girl you will well know as I do that we haven't seen nothing yet, shes yet to surprise us.
