When I was a teenager, my Mother and I would have our evening meal while playing this simple to learn but lots of fun game. When my daughter was around three and just learning to read, we started playing it together. And we still enjoy playing it and find ourselves playing at least once a day. The game is simple to play, you just simple draw a card and do what it says, however, the fun is putting your opponents man back to start while you are on your way to home.
