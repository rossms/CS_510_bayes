I have a Denon DC 5 CD player, and I have been thrilled with it. I have had it for 5 years already, without a single problem. I like the ability to eject the tray without interrupting the CD that is playing - it makes it easy to load, or change CD's in mid-song. It has been my experience that Denon puts out quality products which last.
