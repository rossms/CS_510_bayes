i love the fact that you don't have to wait in line to order when you know what you want.the food is great the service is great.they also have the best menu where else can you get cheese sticks cheddar peppers chili dogs onion rings cream pie shakes toaster sandwiches chili pies tater tots and it is all fixed fresh when you order it.no other restaurant does this.
