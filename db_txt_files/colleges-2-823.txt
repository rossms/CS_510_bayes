I am a recent UoPhx Online graduate. In many cases I felt more like a revenue generator than a student. It's all about the money. In many cases emails and phone calls are ignored. I had to escalate to the dean several times to get any satisfaction. The school recruits faculty my having them pay to take a class, then line them up on unsuspecting online students. I am surprised that the school remains accredited.
