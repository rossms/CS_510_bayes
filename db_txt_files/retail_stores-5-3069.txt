Friendly service, good variety and never a protest or lecture when I make a return for cash or exchange are why Depot is my favorite for office supplies and furniture. The three stores I have shopped were intent on showing me the kind of consideration normally expected from a neighborhood grocery! That says a lot in my experience.
