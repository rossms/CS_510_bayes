Stephen King does have a knack for creating nuanced characters. His build up to the climax is impressive, and made me read this book over the course of 3 days. I disliked the resolution however- the characters he developed so carefully were thrown over for a quick solution. He overuses the hand of God thing too much, and it felt like a copout here. Up to that point, though, I loved the story and the characters, and really cared about them. The climax felt oddly hamhanded compared to the rest of the novel.
