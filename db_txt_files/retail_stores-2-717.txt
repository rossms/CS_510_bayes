I have to say I used to love Old Navy, until my friend bought her son a pair of shorts. He is only 5 months old and there was a needle still attached to the thread on the inside of the shorts. It cut him and god only knows where that needle has been. When we called Customer Relations they tried to make it seem like it was our fault. BAD CUSTOMER RELATIONS!!!
