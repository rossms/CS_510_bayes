Nassau is truly a tropical paradise!!! Not as cultural as the other Caribbean Islands because it is very Americanized due to its promixity to the US. In response to the poverty comments posted here, I have visited many Caribbean Islands and this island boasts one of the Caribbean's highest standards of Living. Yes there are poor people everywhere even in the GREAT USA.. but there are alot of well to do people who live there also. Maybe you can check this out the next time you vacation there!!
