Man, I love this game. It's so addicting that I will literally play for 6 hours on a weekend and not even realize it. I mostly play online on the servers. It's a great way to meet people and play on the same servers with. I wish I could give this game 10 stars. I have Condition Zero, I was going to get Source but I am waiting for Counter-Strike 2. I've been reading online about it and it is said to have way more weapons, maps and scenarios. You as a player will be able to customize a personal player and make your player react a specific way. From what I am hearing CS2 will be bad ass.
