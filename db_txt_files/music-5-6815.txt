I've heard most of their albums and I've got to say, THIS IS THEIR BEST ALBUM YET! It's pretty much a strong album all the way through. Lots of traks on here will soon be Pantera classics...specifically 'Hellbound' 'Go**amn Electric (with keery King's kick ass guitar playing), 'Yesterday Don't Mean Sh*t' 'Revolution is My Name' 'Death Rattle' 'We'll Grind that Axe for a long time' 'I'll Cast A Shadow' You get the point. The boys have come up with somw great tracks. A MUST BUY for all metalheads out there!! GET IT NOW!!
