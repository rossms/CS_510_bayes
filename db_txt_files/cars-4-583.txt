I have now had my '03 V-Star for about two months, and love it's styling, ample pick-up, and low center of gravity (I'm 135 lb. 57 female). It has the look of a classic cruiser without the Harley pricetag, and I can still ride with pride with my Harley owning friends. I highly recommend it to seasoned or new riders!!
