Good to see this in a big theater because the special effects are very good. the plot surrounding a weekend dad who has his teeage moody son and 10 yr. old daugher is so so. when war stars with the aliens he tries to get them to Boston where their mother is. the acting is pretty good. has some scarey moments. but not that frightening. as mentioned before, the special effects are very well done.
