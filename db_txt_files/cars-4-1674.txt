My '97 hasn't been perfect, but very few cars are. The worst I can say is a $45 sensor has gone out, which is the only thing in 7 years to have needed repair. Other cars in the family including Camrys and Accords are only roughly approaching this reliability record. So why have I knocked off one star? In terms of reliability, its been very good, but the transmission controller leaves it making rougher shifts than on the Camry or Accord, though it has shown no signs of wear. So based on experience I'd give it the same ranking as the Camry or Accord. Not perfect, but still pretty darn good.
