It's pretty amazing that the Braves have dominated the National League for nearly fifteen years. They did it with a solid starting rotation, better than any I have seen in a long while. It's true that they didn't win as many World Series during the last fifteen years as one might expect, but they have been the strongest team since the early 90's
