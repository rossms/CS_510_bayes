excellent powerhitter,poor defense, mediocre situational hitting and baserunning...way too many k's. No Barry Bonds!---that was pre-corkgate. 5th all-time in strikeouts. Decline at his age is startling. First serious power guy to be caught doctoring bats. Everyone else who was caught was suspended for 7-8 games...same should apply to this loser.
