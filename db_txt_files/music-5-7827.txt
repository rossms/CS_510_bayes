Many years ago I spent a delightful hour trying to edit this video by intercutting it with the Michael Jackson original - had a bit of trouble because the timing didn't quite match. However, to get to the point! - Weird Al's version is a supremely funny piece of parody. (If you watch both video's consecutively you'll probably appreciate the effort involved.) A very skillful job, full of great detail.
