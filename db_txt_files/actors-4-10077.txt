I usually enjoy most of the movies that Goldie Hawn is in. She is a talented actress. She is good at dramatic roles but I think i know her best by her comedic roles.I really liked her in Private Benjamin, she went from a spoiled woman to one with self confidence and success. She was also good in Foul Play, and The First Wives Club. She has one of those laughs that make me want to laugh too. She has a lot of good comedic timing.
