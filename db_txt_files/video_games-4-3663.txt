When it comes to fighting games I'm very picky in who I chose to fight with. I like Yoshimitsu (I just use to move where he sits on his sword and jumps on people) and Hwoarang (very good kicking combos.) The extra characters are very cool (I like Julia and Gun Jack.) The graphics are fantastic and the combos are amazing. Very smooth play.
