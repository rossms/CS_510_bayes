Almost certainly the best player of all time. I'll try and answer a few common erroneous criticisms: Played against the best defender ever (Russel), still scored 50+. Anyone who says he had no competition is crazy, the 60's Celtics are the greatest team ever, by a large margin. Not only an offensive player (you try and get 50 rebounds!). 7'1, power second only to shaq, but also had great quickness and agility (like olajuwan).
