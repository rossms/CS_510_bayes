This movie is really good as Jackie Chan has come a long way from his Cannonball Run appearance. His action scenes are great and he shows great comedic timing. But, the guy who really stole the movie for me was Owen Wilson. He was absolutely hysterical. This movie is a perfect rental and the type of movie that you will watch each time it comes on cable. Hopefully, Wilson and Chan will work together again.
