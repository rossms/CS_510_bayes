Like one big shopping mall. Just as advertised about the cuisine there, too - the best in Asia ... cheap, moderate, expensive ... it's all good. A reliable train route that circles the city/nation makes getting around a breeze. Also, it doesn't matter when you visit. It will be humid and rainy whenever you arrive. Be prepared to sweat!
