Anchorage? Yawn !! Not that I expect an urban playground up here but wow , this is the perfect example of what a city built in the 60's and 70's looks like (not exactly a flattering time in archetecture). My impression is it's just a place to live and work and as my aunt would say the best thing about Anchorage is it's 10 minutes from the rest of Alaska.
