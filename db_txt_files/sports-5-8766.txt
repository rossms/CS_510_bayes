Hes amazing!has one of the quickect crossovers i've ever seen!i'm a heat fan!i live in miami!!!Francis is tremendous when he gets the ball! He can get past just about any defender! I think he is better than dwayne wade!!!I respect both players but in the end, i think the slight edge goes to steve francis!!I just respect this guy and his talent on the basketball court.
