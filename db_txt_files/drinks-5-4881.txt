This is some of the best tasting root beer going. At its very finest when served on draft at your local A W drive-in, it is still very good in cans from the local grocery store. Nothing in the world of sodas quenches your thirst or refreshes quite like a frosty mug of this sudsy stuff on a really hot day!
