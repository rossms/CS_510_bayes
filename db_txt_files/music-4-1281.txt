A very, very good record. As good as the first couple of songs are (Just What I Needed, Best Friends Girlfriend, etc,) I think the last couple of tracks are even better (Moving in Stereo, All Mixed Up) - I heard All Mixed Up on the radio today at work and it inspired me to zap over to Amazon and order this CD (it was on the way to me before the song had ended). And who can listen to Moving in Stereo without thinking of the masturbation seen in Fast Times....
