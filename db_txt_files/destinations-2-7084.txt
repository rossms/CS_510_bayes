I think that Dublin is getting too much attention it gets all the big shops,jobs,house prices and litter problem,I think that Cork (more southerly) shoould get some attention,no-one in this area or the island is getting ANY attention I think that Cork and Kerry should be developed more instead of Dublin going all high and mighty and other cities like Cork getting NOTHING!
