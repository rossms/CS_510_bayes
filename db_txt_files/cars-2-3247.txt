I have had my 'o2 Liberty for almost 2 years. Every 6,000 MILES I HAVE HAD TO REPLACE THE BRAKES AND ROTORS (over $300 at jeep). Jeep had no idea what the problem was until my warrenty expired, then they figured it out very quickly and wanted to charge over $1000 to fix it.*****DO NOT BUY A JEEP*****
