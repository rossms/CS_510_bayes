This album does not quite live up to her previous work but it's still great to listen to. Her version of '97 Bonnie Clyde sends chills down my spine everytime I listen to it. Strange Little Girl is another beautiful and quite fast song while Rattlesnake takes the whole thing to a slower level. Happiness is a warm gun didn't really make sense but was fun to listen to. The only thing that made me give it a 4 are the songs I'm not in love, which is too slow, and Enjoy the Silence, no one, not even Tori Amos should be allowed to torture such a beautiful song.
