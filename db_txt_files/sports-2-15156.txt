Not really that great. You'll notice how terrible the Raiders defense has been in recent years with this supposed force on their team. He is nothing compared to, say, Pat Surtain, Greg Wesley, John Lynch, Chris McAllister, Sam Madison, Ed Reed, Shawn Springs, Samari Rolle, Champ Bailey, or Rodney Harrison. There are many DBs I'd rather have.
