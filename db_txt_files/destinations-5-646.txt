This could be where I want to live someday. It is still not a developed Central American town (no traffic lights), but it still has most of the 'necessities' for an American to get by with. Beautiful setting, lots of activities to do, the beach is perfect, locals are friendly and not cavalier towards tourists and the cost of living is relatively low. It is only a short 20 minute scary plane ride from the capitol city of San Jose.
