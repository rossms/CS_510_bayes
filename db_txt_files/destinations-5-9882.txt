Camel Filters have been good cigarettes to me according to my experiences. Their biggest benefit is that they burn steadily and slowly. I am completely happy with the flavor of Camel Filters tobacco, especially when the cigarettes are fresh enough. The flavor tastes fantastic to me. The smoke is strong enough and tastes nice.
