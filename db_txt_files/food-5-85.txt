I've always been a big oatmeal, and an anything Quaker fan. Everything from cereal, to bars, to instant packages, to cakes, to squares, to cookies, etc... It's easy and quick to make (most of the time, all you need is water), is healthy, and comes in all sorts of flavours to please everyone. Props to reading the inspirational quotes on each package!
