My sister went to the University of Tennessee and loved it. She went to the Chattanooga campus and had a great time. I went to visit her and it is a great town with cool, down to earth people. The school is a nice size, not too big and not too small. The bars are fun. There is so much to do too. There is great mountain biking, hiking, and all sorts of outdoor activities. The weather is great all year except for the summer when it is hot and humid but otherwise it is great. The cost of living is very inexpensive too.
