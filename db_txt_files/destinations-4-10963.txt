I went to college in Washington DC and King's Dominion was not that far away, so I went there at least once a year. It is such a fun park. It is by no means up to date or anything, but it was relatively cheap to get in, not huge lines, great rides that are not the latest and greatest, but still great rides. Like every other park, tons of good food and fun carnie games to play. We had a fraternity formal in Virginia Beach, VA one year and the next day was spent at King's Dominion and that was a great day for me. I think this holds its own to Busch Gardens in VA.
