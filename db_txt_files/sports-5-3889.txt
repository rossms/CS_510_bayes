THAT ONE SWING OF THE BAT....PROBABLY THE GREATEST THRILL OF MY 11 YR. OLD LIFE...AND IT'S STAYED WITH ME ALL THESE YEARS...BUT NOT ONLY HIS YANKEE HEROICS..NOW I KNOW HE WAS A TRULY GREAT PLAYER IN AND OUT BOTH WITH THE YANKS AND THE CARDINALS. HE DEFINITELY DESERVES STANDING IN THE COOPERSTOWN HALL OF FAME. A GREAT MAN----I'LL ALWAYS BE LOYAL TO HIM...
