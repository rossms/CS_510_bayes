I am sorry to hear of Munson's problem... but, one should be careful about throwing stones..Can't understand the low ratings here. Not great, but good. Wisconsin was nothing before Alvarez got there and he competes every year with much less talent than most. I mean, who the hell wants to go to Wisconsin to play ball. Please. His teams play hard most of the time
