Went to see this last March and totally fell in love with it. It has so much history its unbelievable. The Tower of London is extremely easy to get to, and doesn't cost much to get to. If you are planning to go around a lot of London in one day, its advisable to get a 1 day travelcard for zones 1 and 2 which costs 4.10, you can use it on the buses as well. The tour with the Beefeater is very informative and entertaining. The rooms are magnificent and its very awe inspiring to see the jewels. So much gold in one room!
