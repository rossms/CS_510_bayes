Ah, good 'ol Coke. Great with so many of my favorite greasy & sweet foods. Is it just me, or has the flavor gotten more citrusy, in the past couple years (like, around the time they added the yellow streak to the design on can)? Be sure to drink it fresh. Old Coke tastes less sweet and more bitter. Store it in a cool place, if you can, as heat greatly accelerates the aging process.
