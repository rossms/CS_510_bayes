One of the best tasting pizza places in the world. I think Pizza Hut is doing a great job as a franchise, I wouldn't change anything. I love how fresh their toppings taste and I especially love Pizzas Huts crust. A lot of people find it greasy, but hey some times a bit of grease doesn't hurt. Besides the prices and deals are great too. As for you ClassicTvFan47 I don't know where you live but around here the delivery is great. I sure hope you didn't have to pay for that three and a half hour late pizza!
