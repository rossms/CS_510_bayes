Copenhagen dipper for 32 years. I've tried numerous products as a replacement (due to the ever increasing price of Cope). I don't like candy flavored snuffs (Wintergreen; Mint; etc. etc.) and most of the Cope clones that I have tried taste like horrible tasting shreads of plastic. So far, Red Seal (fine cut) is the winner. I like the texture and the taste is not too far away from Copenhagen. I got a can for $3.12 (including tax), which is $2 cheaper than Cope here in my neck of Texas. So, unless I find something better (or the Copehagen people lower their outrageous prices) I'll be sticking with Red Seal.
