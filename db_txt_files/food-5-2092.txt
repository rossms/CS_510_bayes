My absolute fav. candy bar- I am rating it 5 on the nice fresh ones. I was tempted to give it a 2 because there have been many times they have been not fresh- with the gross white rings and extra greasy base--absolutely disgusting!!! But when they are how they are supposed to be-fresh, not stale smell encapsulated by unwhitened chocolate---mmmmm nothing better!
