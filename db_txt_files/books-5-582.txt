i read this book seven or eight times when i was young. i love the way life is described, how every detail is preserved. the way she writes is rich and satisfying. I love her entire series. I fell in love with the Ingalls family after i read this book and i would recommend it to any young girl, from the country or from the city. It teaches about family love and hard times, and how happiness is not based on wealth or possessions.
