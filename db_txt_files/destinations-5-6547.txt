I'm going to give it 5 stars right of the bat simply for George W. But outside of that, Texas really is a great state. Sure it's full of illegal mexicans, but Texas has it all. What other state can say they have beaches like Galveston, historical sites like the Alamo, NASA, Nolan Ryan, and the best of all the Six Flags parks all wrapped into one state? I mean we're talking about a state that's home to not 1, but 2 of the absolute best teams in the NBA right now. And as always....Go Rangers!
