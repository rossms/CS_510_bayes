I love shopping at Trader Joe's and even volunteer to my wife to go there in her place. I don't do that at any other food store. TJ's is loaded with interesting sauces, condiments, snacks, cereals, baked goods, frozen and canned goods that I don't see in typical markets. It's a great place for health-conscious shoppers, and their prices are rather fair.
