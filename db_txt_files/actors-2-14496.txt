These Hip Hop/Rap types seem disengenuos when they try to crossover and become more mainstream. Here an example. Queen Latifah was a rapper talkin' a lot of sh.t. Now she's done a TV show, movies, a talk show and commercials and she's softened up from the hard rap edginess. Good for her that she's making money and isnt causing trouble but it has been quite a transformation. She's also a regular woman in that she's a plus-sized chick and now we're supposed to be more aware of them. No Fat Chicks!
