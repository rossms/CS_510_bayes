Wow he is amazing also! I mean regardless of the score in the championship game, I really think he is better than Raymond. He is all around good, not just the leader for his team. He has it all. Wonderful D. Can shoot the three awesome! And he has the unselfish ability to pass to his team mates to help set up a shot.
