A fun card game. One of the few games where the player has a fighting chance against the House. There's nothing more fun in gambling than playing at a hot blackjack table where the dealer keeps going bust. I'm comfounded that the majority of the people that play casino blackjack still have no clue about basic strategy. I still see idiots splitting pairs, hitting a hard 14 against a dealer's 6, or taking insurance (a sucker's bet if there ever was one). Those dudes need to go play the slots.
