Harold II was loyal to his country and his people and put himself in harms way to defend them against all-comers. In turn he was a leader that inspired such loyalty from his men that they fought to their deaths to protect him. Sounds like a real life Arthurian Legend.If not for some unknown archer's lucky shot he would have lived to prove to be one of England's Greatest Kings. Even so he is one of her Greatest Heroes.
