Shades of Billy-boy. What can you say about a man who circumvented the presidency and lied to the public about it? I will be fair and give the man credit where credit is due: he opened dialogue with Beijing, and he gradually turned over the responsibilities of the Vietnam conflict to the Vietnamese themselves (I still maintain the US was getting involved in an internal conflict which it had no business involving itself in). The nice thing is that he was a Re-smug-lican and he made the rest of the Re-smug-lican Potty---er, Party---look just as bad.
