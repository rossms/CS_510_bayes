Oh, man, this movie is just SOOOO bad, and cheesy to boot! Terrible dialoge, terrible story line, terrible everything, but that's where the strange thing about it is: it's HILARIOUS! I never laughed so hard! The movie was meant to be cheesy and bad (if you haven't seen it, the funniest part is when they get to the simulation room . . . .trust me!). It's worth going to the cheap theaters for this one, just for a laugh.
