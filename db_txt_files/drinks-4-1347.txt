Great old American Bar beer. Very neutral flavor that neither starts or finishes strong at all, although in a long neck it seems to pick up a bit of a sweet flavor that you don't find with cans or draft. May not be the most mind blowing thing you've ever tried, but is something everybody can appreciate when you pick up a round.
