It has a stronger flavor than a Camel Filter, and that flavor is pretty good. I've been smoking these lately and, while these are good, I don't like them more or less than the Filters. I feel the filter pattern and lacey blue trim are a little feminine, but, eh, who cares. These are clearly the best of the Turkish series. But, while a Turkish Gold is a Turkish Royal Light (it's true, just look at the numbers), a Turkish Royal is similar to a light version of an Izmir Stinger. I'd recommend picking up both Royals and Stingers if you have the means.
