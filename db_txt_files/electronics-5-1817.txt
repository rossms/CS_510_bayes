Not having played on a Gamecube or Xbox (because the PS2 gives me everything I need),I really can't compare it to them. But what I can tell you is that the PS2 is a remarkable toy that not only plays games but DVDs and CDs as well. It is one of the best purchases I ever made. I don't even have any kids!!
