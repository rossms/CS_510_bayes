It's a great place to visit-the attractions are countless. But as a place to live it SUCKS!!!!! The people are the most CLICKY, UNFRIENDLY people I have ever seen! You really have to think like the way they think in order to fit in. I am so glad I moved out of that rude, power-hungry hole! If you people disagree you can write to me at TropicalGreen2@aol.com
