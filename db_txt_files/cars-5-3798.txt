The last time I checked this monster had a open bed, meaning ITS A TRUCK! Its based on an SUV, but that dosent make it one. Its a technological breakthrough, as you can completely fold down the rear seats and convert it into part of the bed. Have an 8ft ladder or 5 passengers! It can become a problem in rain or snow, however.
