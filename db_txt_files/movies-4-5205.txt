this is a great movie for fans of the anime & card game like me.but if your not a Yu-Gi-Oh fan then youll probably wanna pass this one .if you dont know the story from the tv sieres you might get confused. for the fans this is very entertaining and funny.reviews i read of this movie have given it bad grades and heavily critisizes it.but i highly recomend this movie to Yu-Gi-Oh fans you woulnt be disapointed.
