Salty, Greasy, and addictive. The plain kind are my least favorite. When I eat chips I want flavor. I've really enjoyed the Tastes of America which have been some of their best kind. Even the Baked Lays, can be good, but it depends on what you get, my choice would be the barbeque which still maintains the flavor.
