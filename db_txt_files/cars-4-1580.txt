This car took my by suprise. Here we have a company that has been making cars for granny and gramps, when they launch this sports sedan. Its a very powerful vehicle with the usual luxury features in a smooth ride. The V8 is the best and most reliable engine. The only downside is predicted reliability. Still, its a very appealing sedan, reliability aside. (Which is likely to be only average)
