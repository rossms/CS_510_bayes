Kirk Hinrich has proved he can play with the best of them this season. Not only can he drive to the basket when his team needs a quick pick-up, but he can hit those three-pointers with ease. He's a great passer and ball-handler, and I think he has a promising career ahead of him. P.S.- Definitely a hottie!
