We have a Sony 400 disk player. We have enjoyed using it. We put our CDs in categories so all we have to do is push a button and can listen to the music style of our choice.It goes from song to song pretty quick.One feature that is nice is it has a hit list so if you like a song a lot you can push a button when the song is playing and it is added to the hit list. We can store all of our CDs in it and we have room for more CDs.
