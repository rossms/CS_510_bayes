This is my first Virago, a '87 1100, my previous bikes have been yamaha Maxims, While this bike is no match to the maxims as far as quickness and smoothness, it does have a unique power band. Cruising at 60-70 mph is fantastic on this bike, vibration is pretty bad at cruising speeds, so bad that the mirrors are useless to see what is coming up behind you. As far as changing the style of this bike in '84, well I would not have even considered this bike if it still looked like the older viragos, in my mind this has got to be the prettiest bike produced...
