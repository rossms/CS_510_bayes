This album is like a greatest hits album. Very similar to GNR's Appetite For Destruction. It's so good that no only will it please Crue fans new and old, but it's sure to win plenty of new recruits to the army. I'm not a big person on telling people what to listen to, but I have no chopice but to tell everyone to pick up a copy. Anyone who likes real rock n roll will love this album.
