I thought Ran was as visually stunning a movie as I've ever seen, and would agree with those that said it's just a tad too long. It's an epic story, with epic cinematography. And yes, it's of epic length. Thank goodness for the jester / eunuch who provides a much needed comedic break from the heaviness of the whole thing. The ending is a real bummer.
