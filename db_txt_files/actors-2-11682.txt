I don't find her impressive as an actress. I just find her mediocre. I've yet to see her actually put emotion into playing her movie roles. (Besides The Texas Chainsaw Massacre: Next Generation .) I don't find her very talented. She can't sing and dance, I know that. In Chicago, She was extremely irritating. But I did like her as Jenny in The Texas Chainsaw Massacre. She really made you think she was going to die.
