Innsbruck is a beautiful Alpine town in Austria. The architecture is all old Hapsburg that has been preserved very nicely. The town center with the Golden Roof is very beautiful. There are lots of little shops with good restaurants in the town center. The surrounding mountains have good hiking and skiing too. Its a really nice place to go on vacation to.
