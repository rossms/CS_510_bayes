Shopping and food are good - food pricey. Distance to planes sometimes enough to wear you out. Airy and liveable - not too noisy. Great to home to. If you're transferring with short time, you may have to run 1.5 miles on granite - bring your track shoes. But it's all indoors, none of those stupid trams or buses. Rental car system and ground transport easy to get to - underground, clean, and handy. Well planned. Not pretty but Minnesota is usually snow or rain so who cares!
