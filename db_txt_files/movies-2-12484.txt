I was disappointed in this film. With Ridly Scott directing and an interesting premise given world events, to work with this movie, on paper at least, had the making of greatness. Add in Orlando Bloom plus a Jeremy Irons and Liam Neeson and you'd think this would have been a summer blockbuster. Instead the story wasnt handled well ( how could a blacksmith with little Knight training move up to leader of an army so quickly?) and the action /fight scenes were average at best. A great premise handled poorly, what a shame.
