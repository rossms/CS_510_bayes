I enjoy action sequences but that doesn't mean I'll sit still for the long drawn out climax to come to a conclusion. Did they even bother to explain how they managed to find out who was who in the end? I mean the doctors and witnesses WERE murdered and all existing proof of the operation was also destroyed. And why did every one of the good guys seem to have a fascination with faces? Was it some kind of face fetish? Excellent performances from both Travolta and Cage give this movie an extra star.
