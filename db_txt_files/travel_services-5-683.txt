I've rented from Enterprise several times. Every time I've rented from them, I've received exceptionally friendly service. The rates have always been reasonable, if not downright cheap. The last time I rented at DFW airport, I received a free upgrade at the counter without a coupon or requesting one. I don't plan on using another rental car company.
