When I was a kid there used to be a puzzle in varying degrees of completeness on a table in our den. Whenever someone felt like it they could stop and sit for a bit or just add a piece or two. I think they are great fun that the entire family can get in on. I tried doing that lately here, but my little Manx kitty likes to take the pieces and hide them!
