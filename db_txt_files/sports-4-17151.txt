I still have faith in these guys, but they need Jake Plummer back to make the playoffs. At 5-4 right now they are in danger of missing them entirely. It is nice to see Jake Plummer on a team with some talent for a change. I always new he was better than his stats, and he was proving it until he got injured. Plummer might be out a while, so this team is in trouble. They are down to Danny Kanell starting, which is not good news. They have San Diego this coming Sunday, which they should win (the Chargers are really sad) but after that it's going to be a struggle to make the post-season.
