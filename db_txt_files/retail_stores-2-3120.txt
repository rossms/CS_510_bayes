What I can't figure out is how can people wear their man-made shoes day after day. They don't breathe. Do they like sweaty feet? Why don't they make a nice selection of leather shoes? They used to have a mediocre small selection of leather coated shoes a few yrs ago, they don't even try! They sell cheap looking trendy shoes at a cheap price.
