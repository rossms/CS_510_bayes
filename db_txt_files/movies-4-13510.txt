The film is a cheap-shot at American suburbia culture. I didn't think it was as groundbreaking or having 'chic social commentary' as most others did. . .but the film was raunchy, funny, and had good performances. And Sam Mendes can sure shoot a good-looking movie. (He also directed the underrated and superior film Road to Perdition)
