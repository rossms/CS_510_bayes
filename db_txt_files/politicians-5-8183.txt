I was not yet born when John F Kennedy was the president of this great country. When I watch this man on specials on television, I can't help but smile. All of the history and research I have done on him tells me what a great man and leader he was for this country. Older family members of mine tell me stories of what a great president he was, and how horrified they were when he was killed. I feel the man deserves 5 stars.
