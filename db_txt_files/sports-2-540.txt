Way over estimated. He is an outstanding player who has won numerous MVP trophies, no doubt about it. But I'm sure you all saw him in the semi-finals of the World Series, almost totally hit-less. I know that the Yankees wouldnt be where they are today without him, but I honestly think that he's taken too much credit for this Yankee team.
