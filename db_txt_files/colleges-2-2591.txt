If you absolutely HAVE to go to school in Maine somewhere, go to either Colby, Bowdoin, or Bates. Bowdoin is much better, but Bates is a nice backup school if you like living in a mill town with a bunch of frenchies. You should also be prepared to learn a fair share of liberal arts. Real life skills right there...you'd be better off with a GED.
