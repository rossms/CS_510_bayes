The coat I have from J. Crew is the most finely assembled piece of clothing I have ever owned. The lining doesn't produce static on the driest winter days. Fit is perfect and the wool is very dense compared to every wool coat I've seen, military issues excepted. I have some socks from there. No indication of fade on repeated washings. And I own a burgundy sweater that's at least five years old. Its fit has not distorted at all, the dye is still brilliant in color, and I've only had to shave the sweater once. All in all, the best three articles of clothing I've ever owned.
