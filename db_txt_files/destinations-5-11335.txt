Lake Tahoe is great for summer time and winter timem gambling..you can enjoy swimming or skiing. You have many resorts within an hour of Tahoe from Heavenly to Kirkwood, to Mt. Rose and Alpine Meadows as well as the Olympic Squaw Valley. Tahoe is a must...it's in driving distance of Reno, Carson City (Capital) as well as Historic Virginia City. And don't forget a trip to Genoa, the oldest town in Nevada, just 15 minutes South of Carson. Tahoe and Reno are much more family oriented than Vegas..give it a try!
