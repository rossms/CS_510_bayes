I have a 1997 Dodge Ram SS/T. White with blue stripes. I have almost 100,000 miles on it with no problems. For those who says it's ugly, there are a lot of copy cats out there. For those who have had problems, there are problems with all cars and trucks. It is typically the way they are driven or maintained although there are occasional lemons. My next truck will be the SR/T-10. Just try to keep up!
