This is a great album. anyone who says differently I cannot begin to imagin what you think is so great. I agree that bands like Floyed and Zep were more talented musicially, But NOBODY,I MEAN NOBODY writes a better anthem than Kiss and this album proves it. "Detroit Rock City" and "Shout it Out Loud" are Classic hard rock from the 70's. This album also displayed KISS' musical diversity, their first real Ballad became a huge hit in Peter Criss' "BETH" Arguably Kiss' best studio effort and solid throughout, for that it gets 5 atars
