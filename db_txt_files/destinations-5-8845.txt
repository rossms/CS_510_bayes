Kodiak is the best chew out there. It is kind of expensive as it is about an even 5 bucks but it gives a good buzz from going to skoal to kodiak. It does have a very good flavor. Kodiak Ice is my choice of chew over anything else. No fruity vanilla, cherry, apple, etc flavors just good old straight and minty flavors. Kodiak Rules!!!!!!!!!
