I don't think there are any good wireless services. Alltel is a pain. Expensive, but they are the only signal available at home. And they tout their nationwide service which wasn't so nationwide when I came home from Wyoming and had a $115 "roaming" bill. Of course I'm roaming, that's the idea of mobile wireless! (The service was cancelled a week later.)
