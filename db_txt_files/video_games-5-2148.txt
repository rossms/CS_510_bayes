This game was really cool because the guns were absolutley spectacular. The challenges were very interesting too. The difficulty was just perfect for someone my age(18). However, one bad thing is that without the memory expansion chip, you can't play half the game! I had to go to my friends house to play my game, which was why I thought Goldeneye is better.
