Being from Scranton, I followed the G-Mac bandwagon from here up to Syracuse. Personally, I never cared for college b-ball before then. I was then hooked on college basketball. Never missed a game, and I could analyze any Syracuse stats you wanted. He's a great player, who shined even though he was overshadowed by Carmelo. GO GMAC!
