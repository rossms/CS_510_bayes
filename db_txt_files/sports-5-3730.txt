I think he has done enough (500 homers, back-to-back 56 HR seasons, and an MVP award) to get into the Hall of Fame, but his career will be one of What ifs? What if he hadn't got hurt so much in the past 5 years? What if he stayed in Seattle and played for that great 2001 team? What if he never makes it to the World Series? He is a great defensive outfielder -- one of the best.
