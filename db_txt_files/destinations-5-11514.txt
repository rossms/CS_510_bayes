I had a great time. We stopped a bit and it was strange because the locals kept trying to sell us drugs. We hung out on the beach, and it was beautiful, but not quite Hawaii. The highlight of the trip was climbing this huge waterfall. It takes about half an hour to 45 minutes and it's somewhat difficult, but definitely worth it.
