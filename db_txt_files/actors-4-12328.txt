I think Halle Berry is a beautiful person and people are so quick at judging her. She has accomplished a life most people could only dream, a successful career, financial security and personal happiness. People should stop hatin' on her and start appreciating her. She is a woman of colour and has succeeded in a tough industry. Ok, she's made a few movie mistakes but if she didnt make those mistakes she wouldnt be where she is today. Don't HATE.....CONGATULATE. Halle you are a beautiful and talented actress, those haters are just jealous...much love and respect to ya girl!
