The drama movie Patch Adams was very unrealistic. The patients are diagnosed in the movie but not enough, specifically, the self mutilator who ends up killing the female doctor and himself. Self mutilators, particularly people who cut themselves, hardly ever hurt others. It's all about self-infliction. I know this because I am one and have researched the issue extensively.
