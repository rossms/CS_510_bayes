I have never seen a more fluid and graceful seven footer. His baseline Dream Shakes were a thing of beauty, and once Hakeem had shown you that he was more skilled than you were, he wasn't afraid to slam the power game in your face as well. It's interesting that up until a couple of years ago, Shaq freely admitted that Hakeem was his idol... it's pretty big praise when the most dominating player on the planet considers you the best big man in the game.
