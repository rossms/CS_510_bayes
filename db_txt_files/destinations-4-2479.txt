I live near Siesta Key.. I love the beach its very beautiful but hate more and more tourists that crowd it every year. There is not enough parking and people practically get into fist fights over a parking place. Its not meant to be a tourist type of beach with big hotels. It has very small places to stay across the street from the beach.. Tourists go to another beach.. This beach is meant for the locals. The locals really don't like Tourists anyway....
