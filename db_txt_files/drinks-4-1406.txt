This beer is considered bad because it is grouped in the same category as all the other crappy beers. the correct term for a beer such as this is a budget beer for the price, this beer is BY FAR the best beer you can get. instead of saying it sucks just because its cheap try buying a six pack of genny beer, light, or cream ale in bottles. you will be surprised.
