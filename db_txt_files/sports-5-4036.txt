I have to agree with PBeavr and say Smith deserves a weak five star rating. Undeniably a great coach, though many of his records will be eclipsed by coaches K and Knight. 2 of 11 championships, not good, especially when one was a gift from Chris Webber, and the other was a pass from the other team, but I digress.
