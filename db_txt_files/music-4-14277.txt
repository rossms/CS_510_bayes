We liked the movie a lot so we bought the soundtrack.there are some good songs on this CD. All That Jazz was well sung By Catherine Zeta Jones { she has a great voice} some songs are better than others. there are some extra songs on here that either got edited from the movie. or that was added like a hip hop song by Queen Latifah.
