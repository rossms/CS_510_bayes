Lived here for three years, growing up. Great city. Great clubs, bars and restaurants. This city is much more Lebanese/Egyptian than many people think. To visit, there is no disappointment. I think that many would disdain the proclomation of a strong American influence here. This kind of cultural distinction could only survive in Canada.
