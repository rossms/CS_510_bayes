This is a quality vodka for the price. It is on par with "quality" vodka like Kettle One and is far better than the trendy vodka's in the expensive bottle. This vodka is quite smooth and is easy to drink even with just a lemon or lime twist on the rocks. Is it the best vodka out there? I suspect not. Is it better than what it has been rated against in this little notch of the e-verse? Oh yeah.
