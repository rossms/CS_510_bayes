For all their talk of providing the lowest rates and quoting rates for other insurance companies on their website, they sure didn't save me a lot of money. The only other insurance company they quoted on the compare rates section was for some rinky-dink Nebraska company that no one outside of that area code ever heard of. They are not the most expensive company, but there are definitly better deals out there.
