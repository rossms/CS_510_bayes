This was a very powerful movie, not one I'd watch over and over again because it's very difficult to watch, knowing that it all really happened. Charlize deserves all the credit she got for this film, as she did an outstanding job playing an extremely difficult role. I get the chills just thinking about it. I recomend seeing this movie, but I don't think it'll be added to my movie collection.
