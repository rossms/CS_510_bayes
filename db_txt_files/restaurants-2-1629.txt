The chicken here is no better than OK. The chicken is MUCH LESS spicy than at Popeyes, and it's also more greasy. The price is comparable to Popeyes, as well as places like McDonalds. The biscuits at KFC are HORRID things. They are EXTREMELY dry. Popeyes biscuits are much, much tastier, although they're somewhat greasy. If you have a choice, go to Popeyes over this place.
