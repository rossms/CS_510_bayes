Phoenix is horribly underrated as an actor. He gave an excellent performance eight years ago in To Die For along with Nicole Kidman. Since then, he gave a great performance in Gladiator . The latter film showed his true talent as an actor, and I personally believe he should have gotten an Oscar for that performance. Phoenix's performance in Gladiator made his character very believable, and I have rarely seen such a performance by such a young actor. Hopefully he will soon get a leading role in which he can prove just how good he really is.
