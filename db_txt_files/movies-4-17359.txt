The film which really stamped the distinctive Almodovar on the international map;still his most famous(along with the more mature Ocar-winning All About my Mother),and Spain's biggest success.Osscar and British Academy nominee,New York Critics' Best Foreign Language film.A typically confident,frenetic,sexy,but hardly subtle farce,a gaudy,glamorous,cool concoction- like spicy spiked gazpacho with a fresh citrus zing.(Look for a young Antonio Banderas.)
