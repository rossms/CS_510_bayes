You have to give the guy credit - you can't manage the kind of success he's had and not be considered veeeery good at what you do. However, I tend to go along with annakiniam - except I might not describe my perception of him as control freak so much as pompous ass . At least, that's the kind of arrogant image he manages to churn up any time I've seen him interviewed. He gets the job done though and as part of the movie going public rather than movie making professional, thankfully, that's all I'll really need to worry about.
