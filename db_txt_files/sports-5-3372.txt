Arguably one of finest southpaws ever to pitch (I even rate him above my beloved Koufax...). Leading the Philadelphia Athletics' dynasty of the 1920's and 30's, Grove led the majors in wins 4 times, winning percentage 5 times, K's seven seasons straight, finshing with a 300 win career (career .680 winning pct.). He compiled 20+ victories in seven straight seasons, his best being 1931 in which he posted a 31-4 record with a 2.06 ERA. Most impressive however, is his all-time best nine ERA crowns. Ted Williams, a one-time teammate, called him one of the best in baseball history. That alone speaks volumes.
