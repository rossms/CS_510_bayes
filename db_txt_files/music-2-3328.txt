Juvenile, noisy, excessive, one-dimensional comic book tripe. Suited only for like, you know, 15 year old boys. Who are tonedeaf. Listen to one Van Halen track and you've heard them all. When you consider what compelling, interesting and mature music the punk rockers and new wavers of the same period were producing, this album seems antiquated and puerile from the first groove. Listen to this piece of childish nonsense today and it sounds like time capsule music, or maybe more like time crapsule music.
