Well let's see...She was ai-ight on Lizzie McGuire (of which I've watched all the episodes) I have to say...even though her voice is a little too high-pitched...and then sometimes her voice is slightly computer generated (which sounds kind of cool) I've heard some of her joints on the radio (if they are hers...whoever wrote them)and they're pretty decent. Especially the song called Fly-that sounds ai-ight (esp. if she wrote it)At least it sounds better than Avril Lavigne's songs and frankly I think Avril's jealous, otherwise, she woulda kept her mouth shut about Hilary!
