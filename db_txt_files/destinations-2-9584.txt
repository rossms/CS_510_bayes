When you've seen one you've seen them all and just because it's in London it doesn't make it any better - in fact we queued for over an hour and when we got there we just got barged out of the way by rude tourists - yeh maybe us English aren't as aggressive as some of you but we do beleive in courtesy and if you are going to push your way to the front, stand in front of the information plaque and bang on the glass then please, do it at home!
