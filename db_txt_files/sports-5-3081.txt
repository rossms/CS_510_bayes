Ty Cobb may have been baseball's greastest player, if not the game's fiercest competitor. His batting accomplishments are legendary - a lifetime average of .367, 297 triples, 4,191 hits, 12 batting titles (including nine in a row), 23 straight seasons in which he hit over .300, three .400 seasons (topped by a .420mark in 1911), and 2245 runs. Intimidating the opposition, The Georgia Peach stole 892 bases during a 24- year career, primarily with the Detriot Tigers. Ty Cobb was inducted into the National Baseball Hall of Fame in 1936.
