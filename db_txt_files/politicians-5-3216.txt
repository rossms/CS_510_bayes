who cares how moral he is? If I have an affair, do I get in trouble with company xyz? One's morality is not a gauge for his productiveness. people need to stop saying clinton was a bad president based on the monica lewinsky scandal. If you don't like how he's produced, that's one thing; but if you say he's a bad president based on his ethics, you're an idiot (who doesn't deserve to vote)
