Born and bred in England and have Scottish parents. If we didn't have so much rain, then it wouldn't be so green over here, but you do get used to it! There is a friendly rivalry between England, Scotland, Wales and Ireland, but we don't hate eachother. And since when was England a colony of America? If I remember my history correctly, the people who moved over to the USA were from all over the world, so are you sure the USA isn't a colony of most of the world?
