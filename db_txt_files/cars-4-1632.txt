The Alero is better looking than its Grand Am twin. While I like the styling, the only thing that would stop me from buying an Alero is the fact that Oldsmobile won't be around for much longer. Who wants to own an orphan car, no matter how great it looks? Maybe GM could transfer the Alero over to Saturn once Olds ceases production instead...
