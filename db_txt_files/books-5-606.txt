Full of charm,insight,wisdom and friendship.As a child i found it quite interesting and unusual.As an adult i treasure it greatly and often reflect on its meanings for life.The chapter with the fox is quite wonderful.The illustrations are lovely.Not a book to rush;let it seep into you, and come back to it for a bit of joy or contemplation.
