Returned MU to national prominence. Will have to do much more to prove he's more than a one-trick pony. DWADE is gone and he must recruit and coach his tail off to keep from falling behing much bigger programs in the midwest. Overall assesment of talent is ok, needs to polish his offensive schemes and for goodness sake teach them some defense!
