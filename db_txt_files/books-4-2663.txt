Although I'm not a vegetarian, I still use this cookbook more than any other one I own. It is indispensible in summer when Farmers Markets are in full-swing. Anna Thomas writes her recipes in an upbeat, almost giddy manner that might seem annoying, but comes across as refreshing. Nearly all her recipes are delicious as they focus on fresh, high-quality ingredients. Recipes are also organized into sample menus that allow daydreamer cooks like myself to plan big summer fetes or cozy winter meals. Only drawback is no pictures. I just like to see the finished result when I read a recipe.
