I truly hate Starbucks coffee. An office I worked in once standardized on it and I got my own coffeepot. Eventually, my coffee club had a dozen people paying so they didn't have to drink the free stuff. My boss thought it was a trip that I had so much traffic in and out of my office. He ordered a microwave stand to put out in the hallway area. I give them a star for convenience and another for the cheesecake. Oh, the coffee I used? Deidrich's - full flavor but far smoother.
