Without question, the second best of the Indiana Jones trilogy. Raiders of the Lost Ark is the clear #1, and Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom is definitely in the basement (don't get me started on the countless problems with that movie). Sean Connery is kind of funny as Indy's dad, although after James Bond it's hard to take him seriously as a bumbling bookworm. The story is pretty good, the acting is OK, and the Indiana Jones character is as likeable as ever, but the magic of Raiders of the Lost Ark just isn't there.
