i really enjoyed this movie. mostly cause, as a young person, it was a time in history i wanted to be more educated about. i didn't realize costner's accent was supposed to be bostontonian. but i thought it was cute on him, nevertheless. but it was definitely well acted and written with the finer points of art of screenplays in mind. i think they over-demonized the military people, though.
