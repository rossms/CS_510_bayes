I love it. The people are very friendly, and, for example, will stop to help you if you're stranded on the side of the road. The weather always is changing (It snows long enough to be interesting, then melts within a week.) The cost of living is cheap, but both Tulsa and OKC have theatre, symphonies/opera, and excellent universities. There's a surprising amount of diversity - a Little Vietnam in OKC, Hispanic communities, Native American communities (check out the Red Earth Festival), etc.
