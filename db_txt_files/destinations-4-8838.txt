oh yeah kodiak wintergreen....made me almost fall down and faint when i first tried it. it was my first dip ever, which somehow got me hooked instantly. quitting time is coming soon after chewing approx 5 cans now in less than a year.....yeah i know i am a wimp, but i might try this one more time and see what my buzz is like now.. good stuff, but expensive
