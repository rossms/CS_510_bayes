The original of all Nintendo Systems.... and it is god. None of these other consoles would be around with the grey box! Super Mario 2, (with the 4 electable plyers, including Toadstool and Toad!!) is probably my favorite game of all time, with Mario 3 at an EXTREMELY close second. NES was my first true love, and it continues to be so to this day. I'll never give up my NES! My kids will play the original Mario by my side.
