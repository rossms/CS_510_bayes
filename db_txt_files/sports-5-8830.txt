Ray Allen is a thoroughbred. Tall and fast, his jump shot is gone before you can blink, and more often than not it is right on target. After watching him torch is the Sixers in Game 2 of the 01 Conference Finals, it is clear to me that Ray Allen belongs in a class with the Vince Carters, Iversons, and Kobes - he is that good. It seems a shame that he is not better promoted by the league - maybe he needs to develop an attitude.
