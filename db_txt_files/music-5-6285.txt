I bought this one today and wow! This is the album that I have been waiting for, for a long time. There are some great songs. This album has a unique sound, really more of a 70's sounding album than a 2000 sounding album, which I find refreshing. Some of the teens, who have no sense of their hard rock history may not get this one, but I do. The songs are catchy and fun.
