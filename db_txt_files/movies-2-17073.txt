Tom and Nicole are brilliant, but the film itself is gratuitously violent and lacking in plot other than making excuses for artful cinematography, edgy sex, and unexplained ultraviolence. Like A Clockwork Orange, my advice is to skip the movie and buy the soundtrack instead. If you liked A Clockwork Orange, you'll love this. Otherwise, you will walk away feeling soiled.
