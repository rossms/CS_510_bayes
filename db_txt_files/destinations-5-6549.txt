I have lived here for about ten years and i wouldn't wanna live any where else. yes we do have funny accents and we say words like ya'll and ain't and fixin to, but texas people are some of the hard workinest people in the world. and EAST TEXAS AND CENTRAL TO WEST LOUISIANNA is the high school football capital of the world.
