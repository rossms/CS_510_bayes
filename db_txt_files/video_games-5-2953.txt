My all time favorite Ps2 game mainly because you dont have to all ways to missions and I also love the fact that it is so damn funny and ignorant and offensive and violent and parents hate it whats not to love about it. In my opinion it is at least 10 or 20 times better then vice city. Now people thinks it is offensive to woman. Well if your one of those people who tend to think this then there is one very easy solution dont play the game. Play a little boring game of wheel of forune or tetris or something.
