A Coltrane masterpiece and perhaps the best entry point into the music of this legend. No one can fail to dig the minor blues of the first track. Recorded after his initial apprenticeship with Miles but pre-dating his excursions into free jazz forms that can be hard work for the uninitiated. Definately give it a try. ps - check out the sidemen! CD rom version is interesting.
