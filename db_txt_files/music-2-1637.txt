Just kick it in already. Bono, the most arrogant, annoying man on the planet returns with his pals for another journey into the realms of banality and mediocrity. The fist single from this album (elevation) sounds like something a teenage band would play and write. Its just a bad song. I live in Ireland and Bono is never out of the damn papers, i hate him with all my little black heart. (although his arrogance and annoyingness have done wonders for his 'drop the debt' campaign! so good work)
