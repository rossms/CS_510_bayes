Chalky and PBeavr are right on about Mugabe, he's a terrorist of the highest order. Used to be Zimbabwe was nice to visit (the ancient kingdom and Vic Falls esp), but from what I hear people's land's been snagged, whites are routinely victimized, and the country is in crisis. I wouldn't go there now. *PS: It doesn't hurt Mugabe that Zimbabwe is on this year's UN Human Rights Commission, along with other stellars China, Congo, Saudi Arabia, Sudan.
