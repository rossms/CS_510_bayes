In-N-Out Burger has to be the best fast food chain ever. I am from Virginia, and when I go to California the first place I go is In-n-Out. There is nothing like their double double with cheese animal style. I wish one would come to the east coast. I only get out there once a year, but when I do I live at In-n-Out burger.
