This is a car that is constantly over looked. It probably the best affordable sedan on the market. It has plenty of power with 3.8 V.6 and it handles very well for a car of its size. Plenty of room in the back, front, and trunk. If you don't want a mini van and your look for a good sized car take a look at the LeSabre
