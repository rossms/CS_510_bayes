I first played this game at my friends house and I loved it! For my last birthday I got the game and when I played it on my computer it went slow because we had not enough memory. But a few months ago we got a new computer, so I played my game and it was better than ever. This is the most realistic game on the planet, I couldn't stop talking about it, I played so much, I beat the first 14 levels in one day. The sounds, also add so much suspence and atmosphere to the game, I recommend this game to everyone!
