New and quite a preppy place. But we've visited 3 times now and have well enjoyed it each time. Food was always prepared perfectly. And, as with all restaurants of this style, service is tediously over the top ("I'm Jennifer and I will serve your salt today." Last week I actually had a steak rather than fish (just wasn't in the mood) and it was prepared perfectly. Only downside is they are on the expensive side.
