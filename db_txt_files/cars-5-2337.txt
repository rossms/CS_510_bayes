I have driven many cars and motorcycles. Nothing compares to a Boxster so far. Superb handling, excellent looks, interior. Will embarass almost anything on the road in the twisties. Even C6 owners must force a grin and wink when I press them! Boxster S quality / value beat C6 Z51 w/ auto-top in my comparo, so I bought and have not been let down. Nothing beats a PORSCHE so go get it...if you don't like - trade for a C6 and go fast in a straight line, but keep it forever lest the trade-in!
