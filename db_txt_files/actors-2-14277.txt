I was so NOT surprised to hear that she is in Rehab. She has been acting loopy for years. And what is up with those lips? It looks like she had a small rodent shot into her upper lip. Just say No to collagen Mel. Her acting is also pretty lame. She thrives on the trashy girl who has a really big heart and is really sweet and cutesy and wants so badly to be good. Argh, she annoys me!
