Im a freshman in high school and im from o.k, ive been dippin since i was 8, i started on copenhagen fine cut and ill die on it, pouches only have .92 oz but regular cans have 1.02 so i dont think its worth it when you can regulate how much you want and when. when your lip starts hurtin you dont want the same size you want to cut down a bit. and when it feels good you can take a big dip. by far copenhagen is the best, my dad used to dip skoal and he say im more of a man than him because i dip copenhagen
