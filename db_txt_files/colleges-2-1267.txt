Most recipients of the undergraduate degree go on to graduate school. Why?? If you graduate from Berzerkeley, presto, you are trash (and you will be treated as such, because you will carelessly and stupidly dominate everyone you encounter). Therefore, you must waste more of your life at graduate school in order to negate the form or label that you were unfortunate enough to receive from a weenie institution like Berzerkeley, i.e., to make yourself a productive person in society (once again?).
