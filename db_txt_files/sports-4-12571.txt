This is a good football team with talented players and fairly good coaches. I sure would like to have Spurrier back, but we have Zook and we should be lucky for what we have. considering some teams DONT go to bowl games and some teams don't even have a winning record, or a win a game period, I consider the gators a good team. Just as much talent as UGA, FSU, UM. It's just a new coach. It's been two years and I think the stability is coming back to the team. 3rd season and you know what they say: third time's a charm.
