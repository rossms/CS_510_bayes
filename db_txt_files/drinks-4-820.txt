Gotta love the advertisments. 3 guys slapping themselves in the head will always get a laugh. As far as the beer. Good, not great as a general beer. As a LIGHT beer (which should only be for women and lightweights) it is really good. Good taste and if you're watching the carbs, take off the label and enjoy!
