Probably the best album of 2001. Inventive, and yet despite the 7 to 10 min. epics, no filler(Except 'Mantra' whatever that's about). Tool has come up with another hard rock classic. Great writing and great instrumentation. Nuff said. It's a fact that listening to a TOOL cd will bring and intresting, sometimes unusual, but always amazing experience. Favorites include 'The Grudge,' 'Reflection,' and 'Ticks and Leeches.'
