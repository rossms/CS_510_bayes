THE BEST METALLICA ALBUM SO FAR. Every tune on this disc is awsome, and much like 'the Black Album' and 'Kill em' All', it flows like an album should. A lot of Metallica's best songs are on here 'Battery,' 'the title track,' 'The Thing That Should Not Be,' 'Disposeable Heroes,' and 'Danage Inc.' This is the album where James' voice is finally perfect all the way through. By far, it's also one of Metallica's best instrumentally. Kirk's most crisp solos are on here. This is an album that every metalhead should have in their collection.
