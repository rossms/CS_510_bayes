Terribbly underated as a president. Although everyone knows who Adams is and what he did in Congress they don't what he did in the presidency. Kinda like Ulysses Grant accept in war. This was a guy, who when the nation was burning for war, which would clearly of destroyed the U.S, did the unpopular thing and made peace. If he had made war with France he would have guarantingly been relected as president, as well as been one of the most popular U.S. icons of today.
