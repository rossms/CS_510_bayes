IF.....the Mavs can play some defense and Shawn Bradley quits playing like a pud and steps it up so players under 7 feet can't dunk on him....and they can play 4 solid quarters against teams like the Kings, Spurs, and Lakers, then they will win the Championship. I love the Mavs, but the Kings are number 2 in my heart. The Kings win the Title this year. Thanks for a great year Don; make your team prove me wrong. And thanks to all the Band Wagon and Fair Weather fans for rating the Mavs top in the NBA section.
