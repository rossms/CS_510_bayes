If Meg Ryan had to be rated solely by her performance in this movie, she wouldn't have earned one star. Now, on the other hand, Russell Crowe, WOW! This had to be the worst film that Meg has ever starred in. Crowe, like other raters have added, made the movie. He was excellent. The movie did have a bad plot, but intensions were good. I thought that they could've added more to Meg's character, allowing her to do more then the sobbing wife who was falling apart . I would have demanded a sex scene w/ Crowe if I were her!!! WWOOO HOOOO!!! Sorry, did I say that? ;o)
