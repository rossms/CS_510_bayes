Yahtzee is a really good game, but not as good as Kismet. Kismet is the same as Yahtzee but with the addition of colored dots-instead of all black-on the dice. So, 5 dice of the same number, i.e. 1, would only be worth 5 pts. in Yahtzee but would be a flush (all green dice) worth considerably more pts. in Kismet. Our family has been playing Kismet for decades and even take it with us on vacations!
