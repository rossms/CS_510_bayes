Place is good for families and older people and people looking for a decent job. However, the young and hip will be highly dissapointed. Like Charlotte and many southern cities, the triangle area is bland. There is very little excitement and not much to do. The geography is very boring as well with nothing but pine trees. No major bodies of water no major architectures. The place is more like a large town instead of a city. Traffic is bad and everything is spread out. Very little sensr of culture.
