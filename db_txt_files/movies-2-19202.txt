If this was being rated as a comedy, I would give this movie at least one more star. As a horror movie, well...... it's not. It has elements of a horror movie, but it's more of a comedy. The movie itself is pretty funny and watchable. Some of the movie tends to have too much 80's nostalga though (and we know that's never a good thing). Other than that, it's enjoyable to watch (it's better than a lot of other movie sequels that's for sure). This movie just needs to be moved to the comedy section to recieve a better rating.
