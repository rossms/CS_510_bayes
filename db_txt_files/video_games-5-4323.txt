A game which brings back very fond memories for me. The operatic and epic war marches as you send your battle-readied paladins out to face a slavering contingent of two-headed ogres, the humorous annoyance of the units when you clicked on them too often (stop touching me, ehehe, that tickles) and the ludicrous overacting in the briefing scenes. Playing over a network was the best, especially when you'd get in an argument with one of your supposed allies over who THAT gold mine belonged to.
