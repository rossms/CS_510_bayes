I've been using Cellular One SVC for several months. It's okay service but often the line is cutting off. It's hard to hear. Also, they gave me a $100 limit because I didn't have enough credit. So, whenever I reach the $100 limit my service is temporarily interupted. What an inconvenience. Maybe it depends on the state. I am unhappy with Cellular One.
