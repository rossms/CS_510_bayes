This is one of Cooper's greatest moments in rock (and he has had plenty). Every song from this 2000 album completely rocks. I was relatively new to Alice's music but now I am hooked and have gone back and bought the classic stuff. Cooper is a legend and if you aren't familiar with his music then you should be ashamed.
