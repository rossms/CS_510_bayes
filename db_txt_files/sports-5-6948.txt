I grew up watching this basketball prodigy from the Hoosier State duel non-stop with fellow greats like Magic Johnson, Julius Erving and Isiah Thomas for the championship. He captured my imagination like few others have and I haven't seen the likes of him since. In fact, Magic himself said there will never, ever be another Larry Bird - and I agree with him. I have wonderful memories of him in his prime. He was most excellent and will remain my favorite basketball player of all time. Thanks for the memories No. 33 of the Indiana State Sycamores and the Boston Celtics.
