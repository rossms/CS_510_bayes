Of the big discount department stores, Target is one of the better ones. When reviewing Target, one can't avoid the obvious comparison with Wal-Mart. Target stores seem to be a bit more expensive and have less selection; however, the stores are less clutter, are stocked with higher quality and trendier items, and are better laid out. The bottom line is that Target is the hipper, younger version of Wal-Mart.
