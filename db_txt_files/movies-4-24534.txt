Unfortunately, it had some of those WWF fighting elements in there. However, it actually still had the sam type of feeling when watching the two mummy movies. It's a basic plot. Nothing to really complain about. The actors and actresses did their best with what they had (I'm sure the guys appreciated Kelly Woo's body....I mean performance). Rock really came out as a serious actor (admit it, you were expecting byond WWF plot cheesey).
