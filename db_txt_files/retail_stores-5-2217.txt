Publix is the best grocery chain in Florida, by far. I've heard some people complain about it being much more expensive than its competitors, but I don't think it is. It may cost slightly more to shop at Publix, but it's worth it. The products are usually fresher and of a higher quality. Also, the customer service is far superior than at other chains. In general, the stores are clean and well-maintained. In South Florida, Publix stores are awesome, although I think the quality slips a little in the Gainesville and Jacksonville areas.
