The movie was almost as wonderfully written as the book. Keep in mind the book takes place in the 1930's. The movie seems to take place later on. Tom Hanks plays a security guard living in the deep south who befriends a prisoner named John Coffey played to perfection by Michael Clarke Duncan. A awe inspiring story that's tragic and deeply fulfulling.
