We haven't heard from these guys in a long time and this album shows that they are still as good as they ever were. It combines their typical slow and pretty songs with a few up beat rock/pop songs that go along with any mood in your day. Overall, there are a few songs I don't like, but of the songs I do, they are very, very good.
