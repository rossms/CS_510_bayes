This movie was really kind of a disappointment. I mean it did include all the hilarious stuff they do on the show, but they took some stuff WAY too far. I don't know of another movie that I've actually had to turn my head and cringe at that many times. Some of it is just absolutely repulsive. The entire audience in that theater was steadily going from laughter to groans of disgust. Go ahead and watch it, and you'll see what I'm talking about. I'm only giving it two stars instead of one because it did have some comedic value, though it hardly made up for the rest of that ridiculously disgusting movie.
