Brown is one of those schools that truly allows you to explore your own interests while providing the Ivy League education. Unlike many of its Ivy League counterparts, it gives you a lot of freedom in deciding what you want to do. Providence is really nice city as well, with a lot of opportunities for cultural and academic development. Students, from what I've gathered, are rather pretentious though--the preppy, upper class kids.
