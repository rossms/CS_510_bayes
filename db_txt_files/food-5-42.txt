Ambrosia and Nectar of the Gods all rolled up into one fantastic creation of creamy, cold ecstasy. A virtual exotic vacation for your taste buds. My favorite flavor is called Everything but the..., a mixure of peanuts, peanut butter, chocolate, macadamia nuts, and few other great things. Some wierd flavor names (Cherry Garcia, Phish Food) but that just adds to the mystique and aura about this particular brand. I think these two culinary geniuses are due for sainthood in the Universal Church of Ice Cream.
