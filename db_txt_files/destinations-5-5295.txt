The South lost the Civil War in Gettysburg, they died in honor of what they believed in wrong or right it's a eerie place to visit and I recommend it highly. Many from the South of today still have hatred towards Gettysburg, my advice to you would be to pay honor to your fallin relatives with honor not with Git-R-Done and Rebel flag waving stereotypical Redneck fashion. If the Confederates of 1863 saw how their Flag has been turned into a Redneck Icon, they would be sick.
