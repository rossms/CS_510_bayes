I don't care if this stuff was made in a Martian sweatshop - Grey Goose cannot be beat. The fact that it is as low as it is on the list just reflects how inexperienced with the product most people are; I'll admit, it is a little hard on the wallet. Yet, anyone more concerned with the quality of the beverage and less so with its place of manufacture can appreciate the unrivaled smoothness of this product. It's the only vodka I can really enjoy straight.
