More fun to be had here than in most cities twenty times the size. Wide open, with singing and dancing, drinking and carrying on til all hours. Some of the most enjoyable people in the world in one of the most isolated large settlements thereon. On the other hand, it's small, cold and foggy and not particularly pretty.
