The soundtrack has an old 50's feel to it, like old Roman and Greek adventures (eg. Ben Hur). I like that the music has an Egyptian quality because during the Roman Empire Rome covered Egypt. The composing is of a large orchestra that pulls the audience in with each dramatic scene it adheres to. I have been listening to this soundtrack at least twice a month.
