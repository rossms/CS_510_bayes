The interior is near perfect design, while the body is a work of art. I currently have 60k on the car and it performs like the day it came off the floor. Toyota is reknown for thier reliablity and performance, this car has both. While not as fast in a straight line as some cars, it really shines in the corners. Where it can hang with the best of them. If you're considering buying one -- DO IT....the interior is comfortable and is well suited for long trips. I average about 27-29 mpg, so it fairly cheap to operate as well
