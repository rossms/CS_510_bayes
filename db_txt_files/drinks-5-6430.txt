I think that TaB is the best diet soft drink ever made. I cannot understand why Coke doesn't make it more available. I have to drive hundreds of miles just to buy it. It is the only soft drink that I ever drink. So far I have found no other soft drink that even comes close to the great taste of TaB. PAY ATTENTION COKE! YOUR CUSTOMERS ARE SCREAMING FOR MORE TAB!
