If you simply rate a team for what they have won, then you're really not a fan of the team or the sport at all. You're just a fan of winning. I'd like to see how many teams would have their fans stick around for so many years if they didn't win. Wrigley Field IS baseball, and other teams' fans often hate the fact that there is so much support for a team that has had such a long dry spell.
