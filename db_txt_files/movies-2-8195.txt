I thought this movie would be funny after all the hype I heard. We rented it and were we disappointed. We only found one scene funny.The rest was nothing more than gross bathroom humor and even cruelty. The only reason I am giving this a two instead of a one is I like the fact that Mary was so kind to her brother who had some disabilities.I guess for now on I will avoid gross out movies. If others do not like this type of humor I would say stay away from this movie.
