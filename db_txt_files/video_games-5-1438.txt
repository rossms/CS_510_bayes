A great game. ALmost completed with it, and the story is so great. The graphics are great, too. And if anyone says Celda is so bad with cel animation check the game out. Cel was a great idea. It shows facial expressions well, and the ocean and creatures (especially the bosses) are beautiful. Check this game out for a great play.
