I have great respect for catchers who are good hitters. So why did I give Mike Piazza a 2? Maybe I should rephrase my statement---I have respect for catchers who can catch and hit. And Mike Pizza (if I spelled his name wrong, please forgive me) CAN'T CATCH! I gave him a two just because he can hit. He is your typical d***yankee . It's him, not John Rocker, that people should be throwing beer bottles at. At least John can play his designated position!
