Speed is a decent game that is evenly balanced between luck and skill. Your success largely depends on the hand you are dealt, but it is equally important to have a quick and responsive mind in order to lay the cards down before your opponent. Overall, Speed is a fun game that is fast-paced with a fairly simple concept.
