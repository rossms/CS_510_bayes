Denny's owns the late night breakfast menu. Who can dispute that the poetically named Moons Over My Hammy is not the ultimate late night dish? The role which Denny's plays in servicing the late night, boozed up crowd makes this chain a national treasure in my opinion. On another note, I'm not sure if I buy the whole institutional racism theory about this chain - my guess would be that the whole scandal was caused by a couple of idiot, undereducated, underpaid denny's managers in completely isolated incidents.
