I would give him a 6, but it only goes to 5. The Doc is a god andis the greatest basketball player of all time. He ate Magic and Bird for breakfast. He also kicked the living crap out of Bird(he deserved it). By far the most inventive player of the game. If he had Jabbar-Worthy or Parish-Mchale-Johnson he would have about 7 rings. You saw what happened in 83 when they had a big man(Malone). They waxed the floor with Magic and the Lakers in a 4 game sweep. Magic's jockstrap is still on the floor. I could go on and on, but I think you get the point. Bow to the master0 the DOC.
