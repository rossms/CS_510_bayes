Amongst the best names in electronics, Sony, as usual rises to the top of the list. This time it's DVD Players, particualary the DVP-C series which I presently own. Needless to say its many features, warranty and competitive price keeps this DVD player at the top of the list. Unfortunately, many of the great features it comes with can't be presently used with most DVD movies.
