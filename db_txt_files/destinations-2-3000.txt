It a really beautiful place to visit but living here is really expensive and it feels cut off from the rest of the country. The drivers are very aggresive so if you like to ride your bike or walk to get places please be careful because many drivers here don't have much respect for pedestrians. The constant rain is quite depressing after a while.
