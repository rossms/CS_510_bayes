Lots to do, great scenery. I lived there for a few years, but gave up because of the expense. I got tired of paying $3,000 a month in rent to have to walk over homeless guys sleeping outside the door of my OLD apartment. The surrounding suburbs are generally gross (except for the Los Gatos area which is prohibitively expensive). Marin is pretty, but the people there are a bit off. The whole Bay Area kind of drives me nuts now- it's just too expensive and too crowded.
