Year in year out, Barry Bonds gets it done. He hits for power and average, can run the bases, and is an outstanding outfielder. I always thought he was kind of a punk - that started to change a bit when a read a recent Dan Patrick / Barry Bonds interview in ESPN magazine. Bonds came across as very humble and real - a side which you would never guess at if you from his surly attitude and flashy jewelry. Who knows if its just a PR spin which his agent hashed up - all I know is that I bought it.
