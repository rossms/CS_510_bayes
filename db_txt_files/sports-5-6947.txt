Bird was "THE Man". There has never been a better conditioned athlete who seemingly always came through in the clutch. Everybody knew who was going to get the ball, but very few could stop it. Go ahead and foul him, but you might as well put two points up on the scoreboard. Bird was not only a great scorer, but he was an unselfish passer, and a tenacious rebounder. If I had a young man who had some talent and an inclination toward basketball, I'd show him film of Larry Bird. He was the most complete player and firey competitor that I've ever seen.
