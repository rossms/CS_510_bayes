A dreary movie. Five sisters from a rather strange family. The youngest kills herself first. The four sisters all go out on dates together. Lux stays out all night resulting in all of the four girls being confined to the house and taken out of school. The kill themselves at the end. I just found this movie too odd slow paced and not very good. I am sorry I rented it.
