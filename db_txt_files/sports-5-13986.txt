I don't know WHY Barry quit and it just boggles my mind WHY he would ( If anyone has any answers send me a email) But Im not even a Detroit fan, but i would still LOVE to see barry back even though I'm a Green Bay fan and there in the same division. But at the age of 34 going on 35 this year if barrys going to make a come back he'd better do it soon. PLEASE COME BACK BARRY
