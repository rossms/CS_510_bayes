Hawaii (oahu in particular) is a VERY NICE place to vacation. I love the beaches. I enjoyed Hanauma Bay the most. The coral reef is nice (though plenty of tourists are stepping on them) and you occasionally have fish (I mean big beautiful fish) swimming close to you. I loved the golf course ranges on Maui. It's a quiet island..not too many people. Then there's the polynesian cultural center where you can see polynesians fire dance at night. I would definitely want to go back to Hawaii.
