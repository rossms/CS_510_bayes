I really like a lot of tunes on this album, especially fool to think and sleep to dream her and when the world ends . those are phenomenal tunes. DMB at it's best . I hate the first song and don't really care for 'space between us , all the tunes on the radio so far. anyway, this is one of my favorite new albums. I would have given it 5 stars but had to give those honors to the new 'Our Lady Peace'. great album
