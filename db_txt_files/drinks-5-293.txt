The absolute best tasting beer that exists. When I first had a Sierra Nevada, I could not get over how good it tasted. It blew Sam Adams away for me, and has made my recent move to California all the more enjoyable (it is brewed in Chico and is well distributed on the West coast). If you are from another country or have never been exposed to this beer, do yourself a favor seek one of these out. You won't regret it.
