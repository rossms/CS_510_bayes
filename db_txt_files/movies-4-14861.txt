There are reasons not to like this movie. Much of it is incredibly contrived with dialogue that is often so over-the-top that you think you're watching an after-school special. Nevertheless, I really liked this film. Denzel, as always, is great and you got a sense for what people of both races went through as they tried to learn about each other. The football scenes were well done, as well. I really wanted to like this movie and I wasn't disappointed.
