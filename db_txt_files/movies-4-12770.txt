This paints a very good picture of what our president is about. While, obviously, we have to take some of the things with a grain of salt, the majority of the accusations are backed up with facts and links on www.michaelmoore.com. Having a lot of family in the military, I would hate to see them give their lives for Bush's private little agendas. Please do not vote for Bush, there is no telling what he will do if he doesn't have to worry about getting elected again.
