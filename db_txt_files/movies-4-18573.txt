The whole trapped in the TV thing was kinda creepy, not to mention when the guy is eating the chicken leg and it turns into maggots. The clown, oh thank god I was past that stage in my life when I saw this or I would've had to have tossed out anything even resembling a clown. On a side note is it just me or was Joe Beth Williams a babe?
