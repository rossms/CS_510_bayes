Riggins was more than just a great runner, he was a leader. The Redskins players all looked up to him and he didn't dissapoint. Off the field he had quite a partying reputation but on the field he was all business. It's a different world nowadays. I remember when Riggins scored that touchdown against Miami in Super Bowl XVII he more or less just put the ball down on the ground and hugged a couple of teammates. These days, a guy gets 3.4 yards and scrapes out a first down and he pounds his chest and points downfield.
