Who cares if Marino never won the Super Bowl? He may not be the greatest quarterback in NFL history, but he is certainly the greatest passer. Imagine what his numbers would have been if he had played with a Jerry Rice or Chris Carter. Mark Clayton and Mark Duper were decent, but not great wide receivers and Marino threw touchdown after touchdown. Additionally, it is a shame that he never had a quality running back to take off some of the load. If he had, he would have won multiple Super Bowls and been mentioned with Joe Montana as the greatest of all-time.
