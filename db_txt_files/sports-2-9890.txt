The old Knicks of the 90s were a unique combination of finesse and physical play. I used to enjoy watching Ewing, Starks, Oakley, and the rest play (and I'm a Sonics fan). That being said, the new Knicks are a combination of bad contracts and REALLY bad contracts. And they get the same amount of press as the old Knicks did. GO AWAY ALREADY.
