Like Camel Filters? You'll love these. They have all the great qualities of the regular Camel's but with an interesting twist. Camel is known for having the smoothest tobacco, and these cigarettes definatly live up to their reputation. I almost exclusively smoke wide gauge now, just because they are so darn fun to smoke. Try these now, if you smoke Camel Filters ( or Marlboro Reds for that matter). But to the noobs, becare these are pretty strong.
