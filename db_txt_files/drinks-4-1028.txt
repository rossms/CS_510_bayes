I'd leave a five if they actually sold the original in the States! It was one of my favorites when I still lived in Germany. I was thrilled to discover it in an American bar, only to hand back the bottle after a few sips. I've heard that it had to have things added to the recipe in order to import it here. No clue if it's true, but I can tell you that the original stuff is worth a try, should you ever end up in Germany.
