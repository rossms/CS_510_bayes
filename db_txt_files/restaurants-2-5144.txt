I have never been impressed with Applebee's even though I realize and appreciate the limitations of a chain restaurant. The food and menu is uninspiring, and the service is spotty at best and bad at worst. The bottom line is that there are better options than Applebee's in its niche market, namely Chilis and Friday's.
