This is basically Hybrid Theory the remix (except some songs have a few remixes and some songs are not even on there). With every remix of a song, it starts to drag and become real old real quick. Remix albums are never the greatest (White/Rob Zombie, Limp Bizkit, Fear Factory, etc.). If ya like the group, save your money and just buy the first album.
