Excellent national park. Great trails for all abilities, excellent photo opportunities at any time of day. Don't miss the trail to Delicate Arch (if you can stand some exposure to heights), or the short walk to Double Arch (great for families and people of all abilities).Moab is a darling town, with rooms to fit any budget.
