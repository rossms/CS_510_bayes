a 2.5. What a strange movie. I was willing to see Adam Sandler in a different kind of role and boy was this one different.He plays this socially awkward man who dials a phone sex number. He makes the big mistake of giving his social security number and credit card. Now this turns out to be a scam and they are trying to blackmail and terrorize him into giving them lots more money. He also gets a girfriend who gets caught in it. His character has his own problems and well this is just a bit stranger movie than I like. Others may love this change of pace role for the lead actor, I did not.
