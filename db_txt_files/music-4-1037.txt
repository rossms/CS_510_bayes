Clearly this is chick music, through and through, but I like chick music every now and then. Don t get me wrong, I m not listening to Yanni while soaking in the tub or anything, but in the right mood I can enjoy a CD like this. Dido s voice is great, and a few of the songs stick in you head after you ve heard them a few times. But just because I m admitting I like No Angel, don t think I m going to be following the Sarah McLachlan tour around the country and watching Ally McBeal on TV every week.
