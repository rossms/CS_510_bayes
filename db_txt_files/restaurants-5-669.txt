Holy Jesus these are good donuts! Even Jenny Craig would cave to the sweet armoa of baking pastries. Though not as good as Dunikn' Krispy Kreme gives the world just as much flavor and joy. I'd shake hands with the man who founded this cahin. Oh God now I'm hungry. Read my other reviews, and where recommended... enjoy that with a Krispy Kreme or Dunkin' OR BOTH donut. Remember.... Muhammad loves you!
