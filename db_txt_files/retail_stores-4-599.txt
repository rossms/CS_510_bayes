Some of this stuff is incredably expensive- when it's brand new. But walk to the back of the store and check the sales racks everything is in good shape, and it's actually affordable compared to what other stores are trying to force on you. I give it a 4 cuz of those expensive products, but it deserves a high rating because it provides clothes at a reasonable price.
