Their thin crust White Pizza is my favorite frozen pizza on the market. Probably because for me it seems all frozen tomato sauce based pizzas taste too sweet, almost a ketchup like quality. Also, their newer thin crust pizzas seem to cook better, more evenly, than their original ones which always had a strange gooey texture towards the top of the crust layer right under the cheese.
