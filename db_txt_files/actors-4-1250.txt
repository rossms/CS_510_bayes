Great actor, but unfortunately I read an article that quoted DeNiro as saying that he would leave America and live in Ireland if George W Bush were re-elected. Well, Mr DeNiro, I dont think the founding fathers had quite that in mind when they divised this amazing experiment in government. But if you want to leave this great country simply because your candidate lost the election...DON'T LET THE DOOR HIT YOU IN THE ASS AS YOU'RE LEAVING!
