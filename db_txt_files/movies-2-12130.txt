What happened to Adam? I love him and his movies. Billy Madison and Happy Gilmore are among my favorite comedies but this movie was horrible. The plot was pathetic, his character was annoying and the only funny part was the references to his other movies like Waterboy and Happy Gilmore. I wouldn't even suggest renting, just don't see it at all. I didn't laugh at all.
