I couldn't decide whether to give this guy one star or three stars. He's an unbelievably bad director, and a worse writer, and somehow his movies aren't just boring they are outrageously, unintentionally entertaining. I think it takes real genius to produce laugh inducing garbage like Bride of the Monster and Jailbait and Plan 9. He makes more entertaining movies than Brian De Palma.
