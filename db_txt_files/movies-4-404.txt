I have a craving for sci-fi and Action. But with gladiator , it gives sense to the word VALOR again. It showcases Crowes' ability to make his roles a bit challenging and I love the first part, the war between the barbarian tribes (German, i should say) and the Roman Army. Looks like im getting back at reading History books again. Hope there would be a sequel to that!!
