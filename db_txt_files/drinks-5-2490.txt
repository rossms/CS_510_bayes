Unimaginable. Outstanding. Fantastic. I almost want to use the word perfect. I have been privlaged to have both the 1988 and the 1995(needs 3 more years to age but still very good). I can tell you that this is bar none, with out a doubt the best chamagne made. I had it at my wedding and honeymoon. It is like drinking some form of light nectar. Incredible! If you don't like champagne, try this you WILL fall in love. Buy as much as you can afford but as a courtsey, if fine wines are not your thing, save this for people who can enjoy it!
