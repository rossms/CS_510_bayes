well this movie was very involving and creepy. i enjoyed it, but i don't think i'd call it a horror movie. i don't know what i'd call it. it's scary at first, but it's overall premise doesn't really say horror movie. and when it comes to all the loose ends and unanswered questions, you gotta give this one credit cause it's always hard to do a movie about ghosts
