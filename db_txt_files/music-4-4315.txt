Short Review: Elvis 30 #1 Hits is a superb collection for newcomers to Mr. Presley, in that it spans his entire career in an exclusively crisp, remastered production. In addition, it includes a recent remix of his classic B-side, A Little Less Conversation . In conclusion, if you haven't heard much of Elvis' library, are intrigued, and wish to become acquainted, this is probably your best bet. Although if you are an Elvis afficinado, I suggest you buy the King of Rock N' Roll box set. A Great Greatest Hits Album.
