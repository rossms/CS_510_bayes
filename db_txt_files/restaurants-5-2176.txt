What can you say about the coffee and those Boston Creme Donuts. I am from Toledo Ohio, and they havent quite showed up yet, although they have many locations in Columbus and Detroit. Whenever I go into Michigan, there are a ton of Tim Hortons, and I try to stop as much as I can. But here in Toledo, your stuck with Dunkin Donuts. Blahhh. Not only was the guy a great hockey player with the Leafs(Toronto, for you non hockey fans), they serve great pastries and coffee!
