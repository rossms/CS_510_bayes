They say there is a sucker born every minute. If that is true, I was born the day I bought this movie. I thought it would be funny. But half of the film was jokes I just didn't get, and the other half was a boarderline porno movie. Maybe if I had actually seen Scream and I Know What You Did Last Summer, I might have been able to get some of the jokes. But I just couldn't follow it.
