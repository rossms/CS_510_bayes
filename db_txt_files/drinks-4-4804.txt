Ahhh, an interesting bouquet, bubbly, crisp, unique - brown but without the pretentiousness of a cola. I don't really mind a Dr. Pepper now and then, but I admit I usually never seek them out. The company sure must have been spent some big bucks over the years to change that though. How else can you explain, after all these years, why I can not only still envision the I'm a Pepper guy bouncing around but can also remember this little ditty word for word Dr. Pepper, sooo misunderstood! If anyone would try you, they'd know - you - taste - good! Geez, I really scare myself sometimes!
