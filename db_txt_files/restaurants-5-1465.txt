I wish that we had Sonic Restaurants here in New York, because we did when I was living in Texas. Girls on roller skates come out with your food. I got a bacon double cheeseburger with special sauce and extra lettuce every times I went to Sonic. Now, if that doesn't make your mouth water, then get a life!
