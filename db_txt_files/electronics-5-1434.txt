I have an HK AVR 635 whixh was a replacement for an AVR 525 that had a warrenty isssue. They were a little slow to decide that yes it needed replacement, however I am pleased with the result. Powerful clean sound that you just can't touch from the likes of Denon. As they phase in the new line this winter, there are some real bargins out there too.
