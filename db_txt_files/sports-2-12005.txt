Option QBs by and large suck. he was no different. Nebraska was never a particularly great program. Eventually Osborne couldn't lose EVERY big game. just most of them. He finally had a nice stretch of winning and Nebraska fans think it means all those big game losses, bowl game losses, and losing seasons don't exist.
