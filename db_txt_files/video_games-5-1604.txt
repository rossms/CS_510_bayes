Best. Cube Game. Ever. Sega really made a good one, here. This is racing game. Duh. But the graphics are stunning and the music is just so good and there are so many different songs. I want a CD of this game's music. The difficulty and numerous secrets will get you to come back again and again. This will never, ever get old. Bring in a bunch of friends and play multiplayer, too. If you don't have this, go out and buy it. NOW!!!
