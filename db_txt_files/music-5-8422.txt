Finally! a good video. Miss World is the classic grunge/riot grrl video. Courtney Love does a great job of pretending to play Eric Erlandson's guitar parts. This is perhaps the only public made video featuring the late bassist Kristen Pfaff. The video has its faults, as usual. I don't care for the nerdy woman kissing Courtney, and the whole Cleanliness is next to Godliness bit. But oh well, this video is one of those that pump you up.
