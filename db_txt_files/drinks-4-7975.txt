Very nice Whiskey. While I was living abroad I became friends with this British guy who used to always go on about how great Bushmills Whiskey was but unfortunately where we were it was unavailable. Well when I got back to the states I tried it and I gotta say he was right, very smooth, to the point where you could drink it on the rocks with no water to dilute it and it would still go down nice an easy. There are a couple of different brands the black and the white, and of the two I would have to say that the white was actually the nicer of the two and the less expensive as well!
