Nothing like their previous CDs, I am trying hard to love this one... so far all I can muster is a serious appreciation for their unique and artistic sound. Some tracks border on trance, and the CD as a whole is perfect for listening to on a melancholic day. Worth buying, even though it may take a few listens to warm up to.
