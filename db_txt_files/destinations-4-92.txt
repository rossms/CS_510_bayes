I will give Hong Kong 4 stars because I went there before the British returned control to China. This is a very interesting and vibrant city. On the back side is an area known as Aberdeen which was basically a government slum and a junk port, however there is a very good floating restaurant there called Tai Pak. My one vivid memory of Hong Kong (and I'm surprised I remember this incident) was when I OD'd and fell off a bench in Tiger Balm Gardens.
