An outstanding, magical take on the classic Sleeping Beauty tale--and one in which the Princess gets to be a real person, and not a brainless victim. Frankly, I prefer this to the traditional tale! This is a book which I will read again, and will encourage my daughter to read. More of a young adult or adult than a child's book.
