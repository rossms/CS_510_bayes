One of my favorite series, excellent in the fantasy genre. You'll find heartache, love, trechery, political intrigue and everything in between. The characters, Sarra, Glenin, Col, and Cailet become very real to you. You cen feel everything they do, all the range of emotions. Melanie is a terrific author, making her characters and storylines come to life. I can't wait for Captal's Tower to be published, the 3rd book in the series!
