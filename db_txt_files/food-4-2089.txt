this is a candy bar the whole family likes. I like the fact that Reese's has two the two things I like, chocolate, and peanut butter. the combination of both taste great to me. I like to put them in the freezer myself.I do not know why but a cold candy just tastes great to me. I also like the fact that when you but the Reese's you get two peanut butter cups.
