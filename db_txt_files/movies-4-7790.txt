This is a really good movie, but it just doesn't fit in together good. Also some of the scenes seemed like they were just pieces of sketch comedy and they didn't go along with the rest of the story (like the senior citizens playing kick ball; that scene isn't in every edition of the movie) it's these type of scenes and short/dumb jokes that need to be taken out and changed around to make this a really great movie. But the movie itself is hilarious and one of my favorates. Also in the movie is Bob Barker, Kevin Knealon, and Ben Stiller.
