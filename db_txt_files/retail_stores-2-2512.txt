Sometimes I go to Winn-Dixie because it's really close to my apartment, but I prefer Publix. I have to use extreme caution when purchasing perishables there, because they seem to have little or no quality control. I see brownish- green meat for sale almost everytime I go there. The store just seems dingy and dirty. I try to only buy canned goods and bathroom supplies there, and if they weren't open later than Publix, I'd probably avoid them all together.
