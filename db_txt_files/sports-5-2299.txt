been living and dying for this team since i can remember. my favorite. i don't blame their hard time on mis-management but more the state of baseball in the modern age. That said, this is the first time in a few years that i think the Bucs might be able to fit somewhere toward the top of the NL Central. it might be wishful thinking, probably is, but other than the Reds the rest of the NL Central has taken a step back.
