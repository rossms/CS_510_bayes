At Maryland's Cole Field House I saw Len Bias & 4 relative no-names play the greatest stretch of college b-ball I ever saw (I'm 62). They outscored North Carolina with Jordan, Perkins, Worthy, Doherty & Black by 43-12 over an 8-minute period & won the game by 22. Bias easily could have become the best ever because with the incredible athleticism & leaping ability came the competitiveness & meanness you need to climb to top. But what topped it off was the amazing shooting ability. His senior, despite double & triple-teaming, he shot 56% from the field & 88% from the line.
