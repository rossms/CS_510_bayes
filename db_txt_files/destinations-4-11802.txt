I gave this zoo 4 stars bcause it is not really in my opinion a true 5 star zoo (In my opinion there are only 3 zoos nationally that are truely Five Star quality zoos and for some strange reason the state of Ohio has all 3 of them in Cincinnati,Toledo and Columbus) But it is in my opinion a cut above a 4 star zoo but does not deserve to have the higher 5 star rating.
