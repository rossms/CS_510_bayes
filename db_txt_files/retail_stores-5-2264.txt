This is not a place I would normaly shop, but I have on occasion gone here to buy hard to get items when my wife and I feel like cooking upsomething a little more exotic or unusual. They have a wide variety of meats and seafood and breads. There are alot of things here that you just won't find at a regular supermarket. They have a pretty extensive supply of vitamins and they're reasonably priced too.
