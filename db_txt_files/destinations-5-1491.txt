went there for my honeymoon to get away from all the cheesy mount airy lodge places. It was everything I thought it would be -- laid back, friendly and cheap. The off season is the time to go and don't believe everything you read about the rainy season, it's not that bad. Remember though -- YOU'RE IN THE TROPICS -- IT RAINS ALL YEAR!!!!
