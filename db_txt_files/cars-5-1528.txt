I have a 1999 SL2 and it is an excellent car. It is very quiet and gets excellent gas mileage. The engine is quite powerful and the car handles well. There are a few design flaws though, such as the turn signal switch being too short, the glove box too small and when the trunk is opened and the car is wet, the water falls into the trunk. Even with these flaws, I wouldn't hesitate to buy another Saturn.
