I could never rate any cereal great. Some are bad and in this case the cerreal is good but I haven't eaten a cereal yet that really stands out as great. The one thing I do not like is the occasional bad flake that is like a small rock mixed into the box. Maybe it is an over cooked piece but regardless it has no flavor and sometimes catches a sensitive spot in my teeth that causes any enjoyment to be gone.
