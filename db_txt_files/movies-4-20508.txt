I have seen quite a few Micheal Jordan movies. He is probably the most talked about sports icon ever. I thought the movie was going to be another come fly with me, but instead the story focused on his last year in the NBA. I learned a few things about him that I didn't know. He talked a lot about his zen approach to basketball. The big screen and the clarity of the IMAX was also a great dimension.
