The quick oats in the tube canister are filling and have staying power. They are substantial though somewhat lacking in taste, so whenever I eat this, it tends to be in front of the TV or reading something so I don't notice the lack of flavor. The instant express varieties are mostly higher calorie, smaller portion alternatives to the original for those who can't tolerate oatmeal without much taste. Sure, some of them taste pretty good - Cinnamon Roll, Banana Bread, and French Toast are my favorites. However, the generic brands are much cheaper, and my taste buds can't detect a difference.
