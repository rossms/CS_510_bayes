I went to their game vs. USF last night. USF played them tough, staying within 5 points most of the game, and being down only 3 with 30 seconds remaining. It was kind of a David and Goliath matchup, Gonzaga is ranked 7th in the nation, and USF just got amped up for the sold out, televised game. I think Gonzaga's going to get upset in the NCAA tournament - aside from Morrison, they didn't have many answers. They're a quick team but lack size and power.
