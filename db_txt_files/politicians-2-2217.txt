Rowland's gotten himself in all sorts of trouble. He had spousal abuse issues but that got covered up. Then he was heavily involved with the big players in the Enron scandal but that got covered up. Very recently he got caught accepting gifts in return for letting certain construction firms bid on large jobs and that...didn't get covered up. But I give him a second star because the idiots in Ct have no one to blame but themselves for voting him in for 3 terms.
