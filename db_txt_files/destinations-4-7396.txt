you can't describe the city in one paragraph. my own experience though not exhaustive, was enough to conclude one thing: a lot of the french are snobs and not afraid to show it. They seem to be ok with that flaw. Too bad such a beautiful city is populated by such collection of arrogant monkeys. (you can tell it was not such a sweet experience)
