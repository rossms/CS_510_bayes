The autobiographical Captain Fantastic And The Brown Dirt Cowboy was released in 1975 when Elton John ruled the music scene. Though this full-length effort only features one hit single, namely Someone Saved My Life Tonight, the release remains one of Elton's better efforts which includes the title track along with Bitter Fingers, Tell Me When The Whistle Blows, and Writing. A testament to the Taupin/Elton song writing team. This release also includes the minor hit We All Fall In Love Sometimes.
