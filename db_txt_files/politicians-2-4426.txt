To his credit, the man is an accomplished orator and extremely bright. The problem is, he's kind of kooky and, although I doubt he's in it, he seems like a John Birch Society type. He always struck me as if he would make a great college professor in Government or Political Science classes, because of his oratorical talent and deep intelligence. On the other hand, he reminds me a lot of Cleveland, the neighbor on "Family Guy" too.
