This is an almost good to me. it was an interesting approach to a book. A teenage girl is raped and killed and now she is watching the people she knew from heaven. It starts out in 1973 and takes us through the years watching her family and their reactions and lives after her death and even watching the man who killed her { turns out he is a serial killer]in one touching chapter Susie even meets the other females he killed in heaven. this book is a pretty good read. I would not count this as one of the best I have read but I would say others may want to give this book a try.
