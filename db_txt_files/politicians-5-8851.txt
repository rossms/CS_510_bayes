Clinton was often Larger than Life. Ronald Reagan asked a great question of the American people in the 1980 campaign: 'Are you better off now than you were 4 years ago?' Let's ask that question today. My answer is: NOPE! You can see the difference in the current 'occupant' of the White House (Bush, jr was not elected). Clinton had character flaws, but during the time he was president the USA flourished. For that, I am grateful & must give him very high marks. Do BRAINS mean anything in 2004?
