BEAUTIFUL CITY! When I went they were having an ice sculpture festival...what fun! You went inside this building and there were these immaculate sculptures of animals, statues, buildings..you name it. But year-round Brugge is wonderful also. Belgian waffles, triple beer, horses and buggies, belgian chocolate. Heaven!!
