This is the type of game a person like Bill Gates played a lot when he was a kid. It is the ultimate wannabe millionaire game. The game is anything but boring. It's one of the few games available that requires brain power, which is refreshing. The ultimate plus factor of this game is the ability to take away your opponent's money by monopolizing the board. The feeling you get when your opponent lands on Park Place with three of your hotels on it is exquisite.
