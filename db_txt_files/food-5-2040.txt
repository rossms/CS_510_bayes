Even Kate Moss couldn't refuse these! This year i discovered the greatest enemy of the Reeses cup....the sun. You picked up some cups at the gas station and left them in the truck while shopping and when you came back its warm in the cab and then you see them. Be honest...did you take them home to the refrigerator or did you duck under the dash and shamelessly gorge your self on the delicious blob and end up looking like a 3 year old?
