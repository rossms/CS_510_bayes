My husband bought my engagement ring in 1990 at Helzberg. Helzberg has checked and cleaned my ring twice a year for loose and damaged diamonds. Two years ago, three large chips were found and Helzberg replaced my diamond for an equal diamond (actually better). I also have the option to upgrade my diamond (trade in my diamond for amount paid).
