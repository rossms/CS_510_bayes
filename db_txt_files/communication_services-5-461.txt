I've had Virgin Mobile for 3 years and the service had been quite good. This is a pre-paid service which is ideal for me since I rarely use a cell phone. It averages out to be $6 a month for me. The only complaint, if any, is I cannot use the phone inside my house; this happened with one of my previous services (America One), so there is obviously some sort of interference in my house. Verizon's service worked inside my house, but they were more expensive. It may be worth it to go with Verizon though, if you intend to have just a cell phone and no home phone.
