NOw this was an exciting book to read. I was really having lots of fun reading this book after it was read to my classmates and I when I was in the 4th grade. Again this book had my name in the book and this was one of the reasons why I loved the book. Pete was a great older brother while Fudge was annoying and made everyone go mad but soon got over that phase. Great thing about that. EAT IT OR WEAR IT is my favorite quote from that book. I reccomend every child read this book.....
