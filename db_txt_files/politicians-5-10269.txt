I find it impossible to believe that so many negative opinions of George W. Bush are flying around. To say that he is 'dumb' is ridiculous, as I think he's probably quite clever really. He looks like a nice guy and he's done well to sort out all the troublemakers over in the foreign lands. I hope he stays President as God elected him to be for tens and tens of years. God bless y'all.
