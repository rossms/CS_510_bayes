The word reverend is used in the King James version of the Bible just once. And in that instance it says that holy and reverend is His name. It's God's name Jesse, not yours. And since it translates as awesome it certainly fits HIM better. Politically you're more of a distraction now than a help. To your credit you've done ton's of good in the past (i.e., retrieval of U.S. hostages, civil rights movement 60's and 70's) but now it seems like you're looking for publicity. Go away, Jesse.
