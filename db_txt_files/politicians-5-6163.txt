A perfect example of what happens when you get on the wrong side of the liberal media. The fourth estate decided from day one that he was toast, and they got their wish. Shame on them for ruining the career of a smart individual and a leader who, when he wasn't trying to suck up to the media, ran on a great deal of principle.
