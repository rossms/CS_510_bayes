Allen Iverson is a great basketball player. He is not only a great player, but I think he is a wonderful person. So what he have braids and tattoos that doesn't make or break him. I really look up to Allen not only because he have great b-ball skills but because of all the life trials he had to go through to be where he is today, Allen still havn't gave up and he deserves to be admired. Hats off to Allen!!!! Allen's biggest fan
