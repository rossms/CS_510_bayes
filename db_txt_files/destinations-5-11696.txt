As a resident and party animal of Florida I should tell everyone that Florida is probably the worst destination if you wanna have a good time. Go to Europe, Go to Africa, Go anywhere but Florida .. Florida is just a bunch of hillbilly politicians and police trying to get money and get people in the system. Fair Warning to you all - to have fun in Florida is an ironic contradiction. Go Anywhere But Florida To have A Good Time, primative thinking, primative justice system - It is a recipe for disaster. I personally cannot wait to move!!!
