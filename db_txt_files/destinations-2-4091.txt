Nice place for a weekend vacation. Excellent 5 star shopping and dining and of course entertainment. Just could not ever live there. Too brown, hot and dusty. Endless sprawl with housing developments as far as your eyes can see. My nieces and nephews live there. My nephews high school has over 4000 students. Totally overcrowded school system. Also no professional sports teams or much culture. Stayed at the beautiful Mandalay Bay Resort. Absolutely beautiful. Also I won $1250 at a slot machine at the Stratosphere. Yeah!!!
