I believe George W. Bush will make a great president. I am sure he will refrain from attending questionable fund raisers, refrain from taking foreign money, refrain from allowing our defense secrets to be compromised and will be honest to his word and not promise anything that he can't complete. So what if he says some words wrong when he is talking; that's only because his mind is working faster than his mouth. Go George!
