I bought a case to try it out along with a case of regular mountain dew. Didn't think I would like it but by the time I was done with the case I was hooked. I like it just as much as regular mountain dew which is a lot for me. I am a die hard mountain dew fan but find myself wishing they would keep this livewire around after the summer.
