Well, the list is US Senator, and Kerry rates a weak 2 due to his ridiculously liberal, anti-military, pro-left-wing voting record which he tried desperately to outrun (with some surprising success) in his run for the US Presidency. His has been a very un-spectacular Senate career, notable for its general lack of notability, unless you believe that every liberal left-wing program is what's best for the country because that is how John Kerry 's voting record reads. His vote against the Gulf War, in 1991, is the one vote that resonates with many people born after 1975.
