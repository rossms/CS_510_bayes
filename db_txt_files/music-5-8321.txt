I think this video is great because it goes well with the lyrics. You get a real sense of how they feel about the death of the Notorious B.I.G. It is like they are lost in a way without him. I also thought it was funny when the biker fell down in the road. I enjoyed the video and watch the whole thing when it is on TV.
