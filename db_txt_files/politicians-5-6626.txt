Pat Buchanan represents an America that has died. This America was not afraid to stand up for itself or fight for freedom. It was values and courage that won freedom for this country, both politically and economically. I believe that Pat Buchanan has those values and if anyone trully believes in our freedoms and our values, they should vote for Pat Buchanan. Don't let our country die.\
