I got a MUCH better education here than I did at either Indiana University or the University of Texas-Austin. Plus, I was given the kinds of opportunities that I could have only dreamed about at a larger school. I'd recommend this school to just about anyone. This is an EXCELLENT school for adults who are returning to school to complete their degrees, or to get advanced degrees.
