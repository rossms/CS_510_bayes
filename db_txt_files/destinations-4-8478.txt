A little creepy, but cool. I recommend taking a air boat ride - it's the best way to get a feel for the immensity of the everglades, and a good way to see a lot of wildlife (gators, snakes, birds). If you get a Micosukee Indian guide, even better. He will be able to tell you how the water is getting polluted little by little, from the lake 300 miles up, and even if they cleaned it today, it would take 50 years for the Everglades to be clean again.
