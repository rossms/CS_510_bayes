Probably the finest science fiction series ever conceived. Detective Lijah Bailey and his faithful robot partner, R. Daneel Olivaw are an intriguing pair. R. Daneel is more human in his sensibilities than most of the real humans with whom he must interact. Asimov uses his robots to make grand statements about just what it may mean to be human. Great plots and fascinating characters. The epitome of what science fiction literature should be.
