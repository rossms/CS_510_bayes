This candy played a big part in my childhood. Every single Easter I can remember the Easter Bunny had hung a little basket on my doorknob and left a trail of Smarties right from my bedroom door to the living room, leading to a bigger Easter basket. I loved this, and so did my brother. I remember us yelling excitedly at each other not to step on the others' Smarties, and racing to be the first to pick up their trail. I don't let myself have them very often anymore, but they always tempt me when I see the barrells of them in the bulk foods dept.
