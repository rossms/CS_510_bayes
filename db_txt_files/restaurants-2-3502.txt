The pizza options in Portland, Maine are quite limited. That being said, I still won't frequent Pizza Hut. The one time we went, our meal (and the dine-in service) was so unpleasant, I actually filled out one of those consumer post cards and sent it in. To Pizza Hut's credit, they did send me a voucher for a free meal...we never used it, once was enough...
