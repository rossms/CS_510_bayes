Grizzly is the real mans snuff. I'm nineteen and have been chewing since 16 and despite loving cope or skoal for good flavour, grizzly delivers a kick in the ass as well good flavour. GRIZZLY NATURAL IS JUST AS GOOD AS COPE IF NOT BETTER. Plus, its cheap at under 2 dollars (at least in Ohio). I recommend highly.
