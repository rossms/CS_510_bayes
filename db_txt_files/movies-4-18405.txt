This is a very creepy movie. I would definitly buy it for a scary movie night with a date or bunch of friends, but by yourself, and esspecialle when your tired this is a terrifying movie. I saw it when I was twelve and am still checking for Zelda sometimes. Verry scary, but as I said good with poeple.
