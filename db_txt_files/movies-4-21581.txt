Yes, yes, I admit these movies are very well done... though there are plenty of things I would've done quite differently as an immense fan of the book and a devout movie watcher/critic. I read the book very shortly before the first film came out, and was completely swept away. Therefore I had my fears of the movie taking away from my experience of the book. The movie stands up well in its own right, but, as hard as I try, I just can't shake off my convictions and reservations as - yes, go ahead and sue me - a book purist.
