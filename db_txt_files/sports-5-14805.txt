I beleive that Emmitt could be one of the best running backs of all time. A few years ago he was ruling the league and people started saying he was too old. But he was proving them wrong. He is due for a breakout season soon. So keep an eye out for Emmitt. Emmitt also has the best vision and awareness that I've seen in a running back.
