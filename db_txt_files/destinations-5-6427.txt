I chose to give my state a five. Not just because of Charleston either; although it is pretty it is only one of the beautiful places in South Carolina. The weather is nice and the people are even nicer. Most of the towns are quaint and filled with that wonderful southern charm and hospitality that makes us so great. True, we do have our less than picturesque places, but what state doesnt? I love South Carolina and am more than proud to call it home.
