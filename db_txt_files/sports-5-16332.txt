TO stands for totally awesome. He is the best reviever in the sport. He can catch any ball thrown to him, and he can run it in for six. So what if he's a prima donna? He can back his actions up with his game, so he's entitled to his actions as long as he stays good. Plus, he was an all star on a 49er offense that sucked at life. Can you imagine what records hell set catching balls from Mcnabb?
