Win or lose, Ray is already a legend in my mind. He is the definition of pointguard. And he is definitely the funnest player to watch in the ACC since Carter. His scoring hasn't come around yet, but it is obvious he's got that Iverson in him. The real hoop heads see where I'm coming from, don't ya? Which is why he'll be a lottery pick.
