I may be a strong Republican, but I would seriously consider voting for Warner if he ever ran for president. One magazine ranked Virginia as the best governed state in the nation. He has fixed the budget, education and other programs that lacked funding. He would be a perfect fit in the White House, with the huge deficit we currently have. If the Democrats have half a brain (most don't seem to), they would nominate him for president.
