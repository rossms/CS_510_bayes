Let's fact the cold, hard facts, Ohioans (of which I have been one for 38 years): O-H-I-O is B-O-R-I-N-G. Nothing inherently wrong with that, just the way it is. When you have to desperately point to an amusement park as your state's best feature, you KNOW you're reaching. And as far as Ohio's license plate slogan, proudly proclaiming it as the Birthplace of Aviation , that's just laughable: just because Orville and Wilbur Wright happened to be BORN in Ohio doesn't mean that's where U.S. aviation began--you have to go down south to Kitty Hawk, NC for that. Sorry to burst your bubble, Ohio worshippers...
