I really enjoyed it. I enjoy a lot of 3-D films, and this has to be my 2nd favorite (I only like Toy Story better). I recommend it. It's a bit childish sometimes, but in the end it feels worth the effort. So far we've had Toy Story, Toy Story 2, Dinosaur, Finaly Fantasy, Shrek, Antz, Monsters Inc., Ice Age, and this (hope I'm not missing any, probably am), and this, I believe, is one of the best. (The worst being Dinosaur by a mile. Summary: ALTHOUGH CHILDISH AT TIMES (HEY IT'S A CHILDS MOVIE), A BUGS LIFE IS STILL AWESOME ENTERTAINMENT.
