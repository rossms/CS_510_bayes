Add a great center and the Suns are all set to challenge the Lakers, TrailBlazers, and Spurs for the top spot in the West. With Kidd - potentially the best guard in the NBA - distributing the ball, and a healthy Penny picking up his scoring and defense, the Suns have most of the key building blocks of a great team. They just need one or two more players to take it to the next level.
