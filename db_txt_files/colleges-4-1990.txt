It doesn't deserve a response, but- maybe you should show the intelligence you receive from such a prestigous school as Emory. You give it a bad name. Clemson is a well-rounded school that attracts all kinds of people because if it's wide selection of majors. I now have friends all over the country and the world because of my four years at Clemson in the Architecture School. It has it's shortcomings, like all univerisities, but I don't regret a single minute of my education at Clemson. It is a total, positive college experience!
