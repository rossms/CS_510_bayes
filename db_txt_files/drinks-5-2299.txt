Along with Smart Water (by Glaceau), this is my favorite non-carbonated bottled water! (the two actually taste somewhat similar) In response to TriSec's comment, it is not simply filtered water! The Coca-Cola Company invested significantly in the development of the mineral salts that are responsible for its fairly distinctive taste. However, TriSec is correct that it's not spring water.
