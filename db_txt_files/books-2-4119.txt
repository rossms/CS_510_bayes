Some might call me a blasphemer for saying this, but I don't like Kurt Vonnegut. Slaughterhouse Five in particular is muddled, choppy and pointless. I read through the whole book expecting some great revealation at the end to tie up all the lose ends, but I was ultimately dissapointed. It was interesting, which is why it got better than a one, but interesting does not a good novel make.
