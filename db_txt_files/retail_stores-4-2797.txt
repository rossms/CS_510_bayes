george johns comment is idiotic! Being in the security business a jewelry store cannot divulge to its employees they are closing. It is a huge security risk. I also have shopped at FRED MEYER AND HAVE HAD NOTHING BUT EXCELLENT SERVICE. ONE OF MY RINGS HAD BEEN SHIPPED LATE FROM ANOTHER STORE. SO THE MANAGER ACTUALLY DROVE IT TO MY HOUSE FOR ME. ONLY A 500 RING BUT THAT WAS VERY UNEXPECTED. TRY IT YOU'LL LIKE IT
