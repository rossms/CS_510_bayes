Too bad the Kid will forever be known as a whiner that ditched the town that so dearly loved him, Seattle, on bad terms. He did many great things for the city though and I'll never forget when he scored on Edgar's double to beat the Yankees to win Game 5 in the '95 Playoffs. But his selfish attitude and slacker approach towards the game will keep him from reaching 700 career home runs, well short of Aaron's record. I wanted to give him a 4, but think that's too low, so I gave him a 5. Can we vote for a 4.5?
