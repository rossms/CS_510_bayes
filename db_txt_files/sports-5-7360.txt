Favotie player of all times! Until MJ came along West WAS the best two guard ever. West was a tremendous scorer and a tenacious defender. Some of Jerry West playoff exploits are legendary. As A Player ,Coach,& General Manager there has been none better in the history of the NBA. No wonder why Jerry is on the NBA Logo.
