Shaq's numbers are too often dismissed as inevitable products of his size and strength. In actuality, his big-man fundamentals are as sound as any textbook will tell you they can be; his passing and vision of the court make him more than just a scoring threat; and even his 15-ft baby hook is gaining respect around the league. Get off his shortcomings as a rapper/actor/comedian and face it that Oneal makes a 30-pt, 15-rbd, 2-blk game look mediocre. Be careful or the Shaq-attack just might set his sights on YOU.
