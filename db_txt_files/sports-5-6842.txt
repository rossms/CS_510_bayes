Still not sure about the Darko pick, but Dumars brought Dtown its 3rd championship and this years team is gaining momentum, playing hard nosed defense and great team ball. He was a great player for us, and now a great GM. I guess if we're winning rings, who cares if Darko is riding the pine. Overall very happy with where the Pistons have gone since Dumars took the job and the future looks bright.
