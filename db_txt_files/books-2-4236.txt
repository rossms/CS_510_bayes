Thank God most young people fot today no longer identify with this cult classic. Its plot and philosophy feed on the American culture of whining, blaming one's parents, and refusing to take responsibility for one's life (often on the advice of a shrink). The only possible use for this book is as a satire of itself, but it would need to be published or taught with the appropriate commentary.
