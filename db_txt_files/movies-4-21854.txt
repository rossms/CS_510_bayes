This movie has a good story to it and Michael J Fox and Christopher Loyde are incredible actors. I didn't like all the amounts of swearing, but thats not going to shake my opinion very much.Because I judge a movie by the movie, not the words.Very well done. Not the best of Sci fi movies. But pretty darn close.
