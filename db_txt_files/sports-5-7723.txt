Very likely a future hall of famer. Payton is one of the most skilled players I've ever seen. His defence is tenacious and when his shot is on, he's as unstoppable as anyone in the NBA. He's very quick and has a great outside jumper to complement his drive-to-the-basket abilities. Definitely one of the best NBA players ever; comparable to players such as Bird, Johnson, Jordan, et al.
