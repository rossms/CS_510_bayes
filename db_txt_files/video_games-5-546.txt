"Chess is JUSTICE!" Everything is "equal" at the beginning, you, your nerves, skills, your resistance, your IQ, your strength of analyze will turn this equality to advantage or disadvantage... If you live by the help of others and if you are a loser, if you always want help at anything you face then you will not love this colossal GAME. And staying away from chess is soo easy, the hard thing to achieve is daring to play. With my respects... Cinar
