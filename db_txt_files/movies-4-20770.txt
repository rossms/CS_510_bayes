Rocky is fantastic. I gave it a 4 because...it's a B movie with no plot to speak of. Tim Curry embodies sensuality and seduction-though-as theater goers say, the movie (just the movie) is masturbation. You've got to go see it in a theater with a live audience participating. The audience lines make it a hell of a lot more funny. (Also...for the perverts and the rest of us too, there's usually a stripper at the beginning of the show).
