good movie with some great actors. A chance to get to see Spencer Tracy{in his last role} Katherine Hepburn and Sidney Poitier star. back in the late 1960s this topic would have been bigger than it is now. A white family finds that their daughter is in love a wants to marry the man of her dreams , an african american man. he is a doctor a good man and is meeting the parents for the first time. most of it is the reactions of the white parents and later the african american parents. well acted and a good story. good ending too.
