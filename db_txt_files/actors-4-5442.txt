His career started out great a first with such movies as Wanye's World 1 2, So I Married An Axe Murderer, and the First Two Austin Powers movies. Then he made a third which was a deadweight movie (not funny at all, repeated jokes). Except for Shrek, everything else he has been in has been a bust (especially that airline moive with Quenneth Paltrow). I'm not sure if The Cat In the Hat will give him a good rebound. I hope something does soon.
