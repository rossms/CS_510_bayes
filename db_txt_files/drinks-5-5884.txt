being 54 and a native of Detroit now living in Fla I have grown up on Vernors especially when sick as child I remember Mom giving me this to settle the stomach. I also would take some on my Fla visit's as hard to find in the area. Now that I am living here it is a rarity to find and when mentioned peole never heard of. How can we get this product more readily available. SJE / Ft Myers,fl
