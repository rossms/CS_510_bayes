I must admit I feel better about Reagan now than I did bakc in the 80's. But being a teenager, I did not know all I know now. For those who deride him for deficit spending, the man did not hold a line-item veto like our current president enjoys, therefore he was unable to cut democratic pork from spending bills. Also, despite his tax cuts, federal receipts were HIGHER in 1988 than they were in 1979! Try and wrap your liberal minds around that one! To me, the man did two things: 1) He took down the communist empire, and 2) he improved the economy. 'Nuff said.
