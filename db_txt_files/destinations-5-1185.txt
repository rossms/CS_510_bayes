I don't know why, but I have always wanted to visit Ireland, the Irish people are supposed to be very friendly and welcoming. The rolling green hills that seem to go on forever with the centuries old castles dotted throughout the country, seems almost like a fantasy land, like it isn't real. Would love to go there for a visit within the next few years. It's very sad to think that it is a country divided (of course it's also very said to think that I live in a country divided as well, but that's another story).
