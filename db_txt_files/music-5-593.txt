In Up, Michael Stipe's lyrical genius comes to play as he touches on simple matters and extends them to great lengths. You can barely tell they're missing Peter Buck, and Stipe's vocals are as whispy as ever. Lotus is an uderplayed potential radio fuse and the entire album itself could've been album of the year in more places than just the US.
