One of Hollywood's great stars, but as an actor, just so-so. Like many other stars of his era, he played the same role time and time again. He never really came off too convincing as a tough guy because he was so physically small and not inherently sinister enough. His efforts in comic parts were just OK. However, he did display great range in Yankee Doodle Dandy, and put in a truly magnificent performance as Cody Jarrett in White Heat.
