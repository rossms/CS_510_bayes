I know it as ACME, but they share the same products and advertisements, so I'm assuming that they are similar. These stores rock! Clean, bright, wide-aisles, cool plastic buggys, incredible selections, great prices and more. They, like many Delaware grocery stores, don't carry some of my favorite foods sold in Alabama (such as Martha White muffin mix--what gives?), but this awesome store can't be beat!
