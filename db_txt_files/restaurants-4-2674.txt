The Double Quarter-Pounders are great if you can find a good, reliable place. My knock on Mickey D's is that depending on the location the quality goes up or down. The best Quarter-Pounder I ever had? ARUBA! The fries are awesome! McNuggets are okay, but the chicken strips they had about two years ago were WAY better. In all, it is basically un-American to hate McDonald's... Unless you're one of those health food folks, I guess... Me, I'll take a number four super-sized over wheat grass shakes and soy burgers anyday.
