Another shining example of why the Bengals franchise is the most laughable in the NFL. OK, let's see how we can completely piss off our best player and then when he becomes a free agent next year, he will absolutely not sign. Dillon is one of a handful of backs to run for over 1,000 yards in his first three years in the league and has proved this year that those numbers weren't inflated or a fluke. He can run between the tackles and outside and can catch the ball out of the backfield. And, next year, he will be someone else's franchise back.
