Another amazing real person simulation soccer game released by EA Sports. EA is definitely the best sports game producer and this game does give EA a dominant figure in sport game software composers. FIFA games were, well, almost the most famous games in the game's history. But still it has some weak points. The goalkeeper always seems stupid when throwing the ball. This is the point which I hate the most in gameplay.
