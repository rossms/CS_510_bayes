This game is good for a computer where Quake 3 arena doesn't work!!!!! I think it is the greatest game of the whole network games!!!!! Because Quake 2 is a very cool, wicked and nice game. And if you are gaming on the internet you can also chat with your m8!!! I always play Quake 2 on the internet versus pro's. I am still a rookie but one day i will become a pro. This game has let me see the light again. Quake 2 is life, Life is Quake 2!!!!! Mail me at Quakefanthijs@hotmail.com
