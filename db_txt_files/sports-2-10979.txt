Houston Nutt is the worst play caller of all time. He either runs a half-back draw, or a one-route pass. I mean, we got Matt Jones, but that's all we have. And with new talent like Peyton Hillis and Marcus Monk, we better start winning games. If you can't call plays, you can't win, and if you can't win, you shouldn't get offered a 10-year contract. Curse the 10-year contract, curse bad play calling, and curse Houston Nutt. P.S. I know we've won games, but that was because Matt Jones in the fourth quarter. And everybody knows it.
