Overall, I really enjoyed this movie. I found the plot to be solid (well, at least as solid as a Star Trek movie can be) and the action was good. I enjoyed seeing Kirk and Picard working together to stop the evil Soren, who is collapsing stars in an attempt to gain access to a mysterious ribbon of energy called the Nexus. Comedic relief is provided when Data installs an emotion chip so he could be more human . All in all, this was a pretty good Star Trek film. Of course it pales in comparison to its predacessors, but for TNG, its good.
