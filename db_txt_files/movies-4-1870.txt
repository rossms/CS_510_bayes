Very good movie, a definite must see in the war genre. With enough stars to fill a night sky and a very good plot, this is a high quality film. Good for the entire family, but definitely enjoyable for those looking for good action. Lee Marvin is spectacular as Seargent Reiker, and Telly Savalas is superb as the crazy enemy.
