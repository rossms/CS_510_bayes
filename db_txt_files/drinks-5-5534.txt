Cherry 7UP is the only soft drink consumed at our house. We love it, but we are so uphappy that it is sooo hard to find here...we drive all over Denver to try to locate it. Just came back from a trip to get it....no luck! The new 7-UP products made with Splenda are definitely NOT a hit here, so not a substitute. Could the Marketing/Distribution Department help us out by making it easily available at stores?? Please continue to make it!!
