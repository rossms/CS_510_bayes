I have been to alot of Italian Restaurants but this Chain of Carrabba's is the best I have ever been to. The Polo Rosa Maria, is to die for , and every chance I get whereever we go I find a Carrabba's........only problem is we don't have them in South Louisiana. We give them a ten.............. mwsah
