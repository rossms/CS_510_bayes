This album was pivotal for the beatles. Released during a period where they wanted to move away from the mushy pop ballads and into more exprimental , innovative work - pre- sgt pepper. The song Here, there and Everywhere , has to be one of the most beautiful ballads ever released. Taxman is incredible - love George Harrison's vocal work on that song. what an impact the beatles have had on pop culture/music.
