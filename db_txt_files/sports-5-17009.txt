With new coach Jack Del Rio, the Jags will have one WHOPPING defense! Couple that with super-accurate Mark Brunell, who's eager to try the West Coast Offense, and super-consistent great RB Fred Taylor, and super-good veteran WR Jimmy Smith (who hasn't been able to entirely fulfill his potential lately because teams always double cover him on account of him not having a good #2 receiver to complement him) and you've got Superbowl material! I guess you'd actually have to quadruple that,since I mentioned 3 players. LOL.
