I am born and bred in calgary.And i have to say Calgary is the best city in canada if not north america. It has the third best climate in canada, one of the lowest crime rates in canada, Id like to see some american cities and toronto + Vancouver beat it. It also has the most extensive bike path system in the world, good people, and if you want to get rich calgarys the place to do it. And for everyone who says calgary has nothing to do come down to 17th ave after a flames game (win or lose)
