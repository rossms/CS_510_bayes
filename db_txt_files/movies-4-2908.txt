Hmmmm, a lot of people did not like this movie. I guess maybe I like cheesy movies or something! I really enjoyed the Perfect Storm, thought the special effects were breathtaking and the acting believable. Following the different events that were taking place kept my interest constantly. It was definitely entertaining, intriguing and terrifying. Of course, being a true story made it all the more interesting and horrific.
