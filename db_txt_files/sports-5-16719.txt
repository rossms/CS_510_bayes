I think this is the Colts year. With advent of this staunch run defense and Edgerrin James tearing it up on the ground Peyton is not forced to win every game with his arm. That being said they can actually control the tempo of the game, win games on grass and on the road. With their undefeated record and 5 home games remaining I don't see anyone challenging them for home field advanatage down the stretch and this would ensure they never leave a dome for the entire playoffs including the Superbowl. And I don't see anyone in the NFC beating them.
