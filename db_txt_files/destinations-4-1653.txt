Great little place and the people have a playful humour. Avoid Brussels which has become Mecca mark II and Antwerpen which is just seedy. Bruges, Namur, Ghent, Leuven and Ieper are lovely little towns to visit and a trip on the tram along the coast is good fun. Meli Park in the south near De Panne is a cheering day out.
