Baskin-Robbins is a classic. The ice cream is excellent, and the variety of flavors is impressive. Some premium ice creams are too rich and heavy, but that's not the case with Baskin-Robbins. I liked all of the flavors I've tried, but I'm especially fond of jamoca almond fudge and pralines 'n cream. My family often buys the ice cream pies and cakes for summer celebrations, and they're always delicious and decorated nicely. If given a choice, I'd go for Baskin-Robbins over Haagen-Dazs any day.
