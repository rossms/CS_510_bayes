Steve Buscemi is a pretty talented actor in my opinion. I have never seen a bad performance from him, but unfortunately I never really see him in anything but Adam Sandler movies. I probably would've given him a three had it not been for Domestic Disturbance . He was great as the creepy Ray in that film. He was also great in Ghost World , The Laramie Project , Armageddon , The Big Lewbowski and Pulp Fiction . In the final analysis- a lot of talent, but he needs to be more selective with the roles that he chooses to undertake.
