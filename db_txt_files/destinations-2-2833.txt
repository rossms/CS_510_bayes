What a shame this place is!! This probably was once a beautiful city but it has been turned into a filthy, rundown cess pool. I bet the rats love this place to death since garbage is everywhere! Filthadelphia is not my idea of a good vacation. If it wasn't so close to New York City and didn't have as much historical value, then I would give it only one star.
