I remember getting in to this album when I bought in early March. Now I'm embarassed to say I even own it. AFter listening to good music with an innewr meaning, whether it be Nine Inch Nails (who the untalented and conceded Fred Durst dissed), Ice Cube, or Soundgarden(Chris Cornell in particular) all have more musical talent and have made much better music. Fred Durst appeals to the masses by being the jerkoff we all can be at times.
