I hate Richmond. I have been here two years now and it has not grown on me yet. The city is old,crusty, dirty and busy. It looks like an old shanti down. I must admit it's beautiful at night, but during the day light...stay away. People here drive like maniacs. they are always in a rush to go nowhere!!!...The people here are also quite fooled.
