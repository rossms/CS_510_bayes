My wife and I traveled here and stayed in Wells, on the southern coast. A very pretty state; unfortunately, it's gotten very tourist-y, esp. along U.S. Highway 1 along the coast. I prefer the northern part, up in Aroostook County and the Madawaska River Valley-Fort Kent-Edmundston, N.B. area, where it's much more rustic and Acadian. Nevertheless, a beautiful state and one that I would recommend to anyone visiting New England. Eric the Federalist was right: it IS a very white state. One of the most homogenous in the Union.
