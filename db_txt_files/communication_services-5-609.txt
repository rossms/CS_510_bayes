The new plans with cingular are great no limit on airtime after 8:00pm and on weekends. 300 pk min for 39.99 free long distance and no roaming in Ca and Nv. I really don't understand all of the negative ratings. None of the companies that are digital have coverage everywhere at least it is a secure system unlike analog. I think the reps will work with any problems for the most part unless the demands are not reasonable.
