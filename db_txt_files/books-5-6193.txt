Loren Eiseley was a anthropologist, who wrote of some of his experiences. This is the best of his books that I have read. It's not a dull book. It's about living and looking at life from a differnt perspective. He tells of a facination with the night or the dark, and he's not being morbid or tryng to shock the reader. To me, it had the same feeling of Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintaince, On the Road, or Travels with Charley. Only slightly better!
