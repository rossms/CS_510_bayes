I used to shop there, until after the first wearing all of the clothing stretched out and no longer fit right, and the pants didn't fit right either, even in the smallest size. I guess the store caters to people larger than myself, but I don't think they make high-quality clothes, either. Also, everything they make (almost) has Abercrombie Fitch branded all over it...if I'm going to advertise for someone, they better be paying ME to do it!
