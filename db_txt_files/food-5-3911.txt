Hands down, French Onion-flavored SunChips are the best snack food around. Sure, they get a little messy and the bottom of the bag turns into crumbs which you need to pour into your mouth, but the taste is absolutely addicting. It is the only chip that the next one tastes better than the previous one. Another nice thing is that they are lower in fat than most other chips. You give me a big bag of SunChips and a Dr. Pepper, I'm a happy man.
