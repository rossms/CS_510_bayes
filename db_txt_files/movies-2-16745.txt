Great acting, psychological intrigue, but it just doesn't work. The big clue for me was when I started wondering when it was going to end. Luckily there were subtle body jestures to make one almost forget the uninteresting screenplay. The ending didn't need explaining it just needed to provide some depth to the characters. Please, that does not mean a longer film it just means less is more . Watch the Hitcher with Rutger Hauer, a very short film filled with psychological inrigue and one that is much more compelling than The Talented Mr.Ripley.
