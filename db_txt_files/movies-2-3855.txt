It wasn't nearly as good as I thought it would be. This movie seemed to rely mostly on explosions, sexuality and more explosions. It seemed really formulaic; they had diamonds, T A, expensive weaponry, martial arts, more T A, dedicated daddy and willful little daughter, pretty green lights, more T A, pretty green lazer show, helicopters, T A, nuclear weapons, rings of fire (reminder of Romeo Must Die ?) . . . did I mention T A? But, that's all there really is to this movie. It may be worth going to the cheap theater with your buddies if you want to see stuff get blown up and not have to think at all.
