You know a restaurant is your hands-down favorite when it's the first one to pop in your mind whenever someone wants to eat out. Friendly's has never let me down. I could eat there 3 meals a day - no exaggeration. They're omelette's are big and delicious, their turkey clubs should win some kind of award, and their steaks beat the Outback's with a spiked bat. And to top it all off, they sell Cyclones for dessert. When I'm rich and famous there will be a Friendly's in my basement.
