I've been forunate enough to travel the globe. In my opinon, this is the finest city in the US. It's weather, natural beauty (coast/beach/ mountains), low crime statistics and the healty attitude of it's population, make it as close to heaven on earth as possible. Perfect city? No. Just the best US city to visit, or live in (if you can afford it).
