I had my VCR for about 3 years and so far I don't have any problems. I feel is very durable considering that I keep taking it back and for from my friend's house and my apartment. I almost treat my VCR like a box, put it anywhere and everywhere. I don't have problems with it, I love it. Ohh!! But make sure not to mess it up rewinding movies a lot. I think any VCR gets mess up rewinding movies. Well, people, have a good one, and enjoy shoping or watching movies with your new VCR.
