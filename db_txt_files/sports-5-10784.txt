Coach Beamer turned a middling program on probation into a perrenial staple of the national rankings and bowls. In their first ACC season, most didn't believe Beamer's team would finish better than sixth in the standings, and they are two games from winning the whole thing. Beamer should be the 2004 ACC Coach of the year. I'd say national, but one can't help be be impressed with Urban Meyer's works this year, even if Utah hasn't played anybody.
