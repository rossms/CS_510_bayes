I don't know what's up with all these peeps who don't like BSB. They most be flippin' tone deaf or somethin' wack like that. BSB is the most original group out there. They actually have talent and they have great personality. ALL their CD's and music rocks. Come on now...you gotta give 'em props on Black Blue. That is a great CD. Not that the others aren't but this one aims to an older crowd and really accents their love ballad abilty. They have thier own style. I LOVE THEM!! They know what they're doing and I how that they are successful in all they do.
