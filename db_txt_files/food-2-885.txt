This is NOT a good cereal. I never understood why I ate this so much when I was little. Was it the little yellow balls? Was it the bland, yet mildly interesting corn taste? Was it the complete lack of sugar? I don't know, but for what it's worth, there's better tasting cereals out there that are also healthy to eat. I know their slogan is Kid tested, mother approved but this stuff tastes like cardboard.
