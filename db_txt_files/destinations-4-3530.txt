A large city with a small-town feel. People were friendly and I felt as if I knew half the town in only 3 days. It's safe to walk around at night because there are very few thugs. There is plenty to do in the city in terms of cultural activities, restaurants, shopping, etc. The light rail is great and a quick way to get around. The city is also very clean, and green due to all of the rainfall in the winter months. Downfalls are high unemployment and outside of Portland there seems to be very little happening in Oregon.
