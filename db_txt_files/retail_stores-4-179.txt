For a small book store, B-Dalton is good for the selection it carries, and if they don't have it they can try to order for it you. They have a nice selection up front of discounted books. The atmosphere is modern, cool yet relaxing and inviting. The sales clerk are friendly and helpful. However some know more about books than others.
