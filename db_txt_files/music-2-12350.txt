No disrespect to Ashanti, but shes one of those artists that just strikes me as lucky. She's not as half as talented as people like Mary J Blige, Beyonce, Whitney Houston, Aretha or Chaka Khan, Ashanti is just average and below average at that. My dispute is her six AMA awards, for me personally the music on most of her songs carries her along as her voice is not strong, varied or beautiful AT ALL.
