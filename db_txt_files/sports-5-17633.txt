I honestly see no reason why this team can't continue their successin the 2004 season. They easily have the strongest D-Line in the NFL and the O-Line is solid as well. This is one of the few teams in the NFL that can truly dictate the tempo of the game and will not be pushed around at the line of scrimmage. Their QB is fun to watch
