I cannot believe how successful this chain is. Bread with no texture. Meat is processed to the point you can't tell the ham from the turkey blindfolded. Skimpy portions. Why is it when they advertise a sandwich nationally, the idiots behind the counter react like they've never heard of it? Only reason I give it two stars is because the ingredients seem to be fresh, and I've never become sick from any of their sandwiches.
