A pretty good movie. I finally got the chance to see this on DVD. Bridget is a 32 year old woman. who decides to start keep a diary. She also decides she is tired of being single and having her mother set her up with men. She makes it her goal to find of her dreams that year. She ends up having two men to choose from to her surprise. Some of the scenes can be funny. The actors are all good in their roles. A nicely done movie.
