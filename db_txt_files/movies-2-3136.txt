The writers should have taken some cues from the, Hunt for the Red October. Action sequences are strung together by a weak plot, and the action itself can be difficult to follow with identical submarines attacking each other. Plus, the director overlooked the idea of using the soundtrack to distinguish them. Rather uncompelling acting. Save your money.
