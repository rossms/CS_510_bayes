JJ Redick is an amazing shooter and an under rated defender. When he first came to Duke he was not quick or strong. But, Coach K got him to work on both his quickness and strength so he is a solid defender. Also, name someone else that is a better player than him. Adam Morrison, of Gonzaga, doesn't take the beating he does. Taj Gray, Oklahoma forward, is an athlete but is not proven like JJ. Dee Brown is alone this year and will not get open shots. I really think David Noel is a better player than JJ. In 2005 JJ and the Dukies are #1. BABY!!
