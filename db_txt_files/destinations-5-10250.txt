Marlboro Lights are my favorite cigarette. I like it because it is mild enough and after smoking, the bad flavor of completely burned tobacco doesn't remain in my mouth. After smoking Marlboro Lights, I feel so light. But besides its benefits, I think its bad point is that it doesn't burn slowly enough and it finishes fast. My comment to the company is that they make Marlboro Lights a little longer in size and condense its tobacco more.
