I played my fair share of Candyland growing up, and there really is very little skill to it. The only redeeming quality is that it was fun as a kid to picture a world made up entirely of candy. Not unlike the Simpsons in which a comatose Homer, after getting crushed under a vending machine, prances around in the imaginary Chocolate World - a world in which he is able to eat lamp posts and passing dogs.
