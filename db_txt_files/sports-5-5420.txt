Carmelo's got skill, I know that. But too bad he had to be the main man for Syracuse in the championship game against Kansas. Melo is a great threat with his way of thinking on the court he seems to know how to shake off his defenders with a wicked step nice jumpshot. He's always got a smile on on the court..which I don't know if hes using it to taunt other players or if hes just havin' fun on the court. HMM? Good player overall. I like his game.
