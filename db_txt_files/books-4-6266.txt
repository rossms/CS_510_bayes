Ah yes, the hippie bible. I started reading it a few months ago and was very gung-ho about it. And I stayed interested for a good time, it is a very interesting and well-written book, but I got to this really slow part and I had trouble getting past it. I hope to pick it up again sometime. But you have to really pay attention. Not meant to be read quickly; there are so many valuable ideas to ponder brought up in this.
