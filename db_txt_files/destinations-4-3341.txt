I was there during the Mardi Gras. Gosh!! It was really a new experience for me. The French Quarter was one-of-a-kind. The nightlife was so wild, fun, and scary at times. Keep your eyes on the flashing babes , guys! :) The food was marvelous. Yet, the city gave me the creep. Wouldn't want to live there. :P
