One of the best CDs of the early 90's, it was quite revolutionary for its time, for the most part it has stood the test of time, and if you haven't heard it, and you like Pearl Jam's new stuff, the CD is definitely for you. It is one of those CDs that you just put in and listen all the way through, because none of the songs are bad.
