I can kick anyone's a$$ at backgammon. This game rules. Why it is so far down on the list is completely beyond me. Whenever I travel somewhere with my best friend, we play backgammon. Which is why she now owes me one million and seven dollars. It's complicated and challenging, and forces the players to think. It may seem easy...all you have to do is remove all your tokens from the board, and you win! Think it's simple? Not so. It takes brains to play backgammon. Lyric of the Day: All you have to do is fall in love, play the game, everybody play the game...take care, everyone!
