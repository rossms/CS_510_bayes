I grew up on SEPTA and can tell you firsthand they are terrible. First , they cost too much. The most expensive ride you'l ever pay for. Cars are dirty, clanky, and do not run on time. "Customer service" is a joke. They frequently go on strike ( whenever possible). Subway basically travels North-South and East-West. After that it's the Bus. UGH !
