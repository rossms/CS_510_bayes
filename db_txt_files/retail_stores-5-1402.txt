I love Target. I think a lot of their clothes are great for just layering basics and their Swell Collection of earrings are so cute. Plus, I actually enjoy just browsing around the store at leisure, something I would NEVER do in a Wal-Mart because I would probably burst into flames. Targets kicks Walmart's butt any day of the week.
