The kids received PlayStation for Christmas and I picked up a few games that I thought the whole family would enjoy. Spyro is a hit (as well as Rayman 2)..It may not be for everyone, there isn't any gore or guns..no major violence. A fun quest game with great graphics, challenging puzzles that progress in terms of difficulty. I did get a bit addicted to it in the beginning and have since slowed down a bit. Overall a great family game, easy yet challenging enough for youngsters and adults.
