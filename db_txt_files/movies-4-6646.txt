There is an earlier production of "Gaslight" from England. It starred Diana Wynyard and Anton Walbrook. This 1940 original has the same plot. MGM wanted to remake it, and its version has a more lush treatment. And they kept the British production out of sight of American audiences. However, the British original is excellent, and the less expensive production values makes the villainy, in some ways, more sinister. In the 1944 movie, MGM utilized the talent of George Cukor, who was well known as "a woman's director". I have both versions, and enjoy both offerings.
