As a President, one could find no fault with Mr. Clinton. He was a charismatic leader and a man of intelligence and nerve. As a mere human, he was subject to the temptations that befall humans. His peccadilloes were magnified because of his position. Had it been John Doe in the nexxt block, people would have remarked on it and then gone on about their business, leaving him to his wife and his conscience.
