Although the prices of the items seem a little expensive, it's definitely worth it. Especially the skirts/dresses! Very good quality! The salewoman gave me excellent service and the coat that I wanted but they didn't have at the store was ordered from another store and I got it 2 days later! I'll definitely be going to Ann Taylor again!
