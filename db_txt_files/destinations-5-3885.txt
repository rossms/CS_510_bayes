being a minority in the city - aka not having grown up in or around this area - I've lived in pittsburgh for just over a year now and love it :) it's got all the perks of a big city (museums, sports teams, etc) and of a small town (nice people, cute neighborhoods, cheap housing) all rolled into one! I'm proud to say that I'm now a pittsburgher!
