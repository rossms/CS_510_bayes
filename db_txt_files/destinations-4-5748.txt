I like visiting Florida for vacations, they have gorgeous beaches. Even the airports are prettier than northern airports. Everytime I have been there and they've had rain, it lasts like 10 min max and goes away and the sun is back same as if there never was a rain. I look forward to my next Florida vacation.
