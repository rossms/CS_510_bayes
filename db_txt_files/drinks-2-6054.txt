Mug is a pretty lame excuse for root beer. I, for one, can taste the wintergreen in it (a really tacky way to fudge on the flavoring) and that's a definite turnoff in root beer, so far as I'm concerned. You'd be far better off to get Barq's (if you like caffeine) or A W (if you don't) for the same price. If you want to spend more, go for a premium brand like Thomas Kemper or IBC.
