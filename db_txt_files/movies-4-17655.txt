Very funny Spanish film. Well done version of the farmes daughter. This kid is heading back to madrid or somewhere during the Spanish Civil War and stops off in this small town and ends up staying at this old guys house. The old guy happens to have 3 or 4 daughters (I forget exactly). So as you can guess he ends up hanging around for a little while longer to see if maybe he can, you know, nudge, nudge, wink, wink. Well let me tell you...see the film.
