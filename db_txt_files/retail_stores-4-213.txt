It doesn't surprise me to see Banana Republic ranking so high. Yes the clothes cost more, but they also last a lot longer than say GAP, imagine that? The clothes here look very dapper and the store does well every season with a new selection of clothing to choose from, unlike the always predictable Abercrombie and Fitch.
