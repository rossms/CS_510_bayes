I actually like Jim Carreey and I like his movies and that tipped me to give this one a 4 star rating instead of 3 stars. It was a tough call. There were some really funny parts of the movie (especially in the first 1/3 of it) and some that were just bland. I think it was the crudest film that I have ever seen with Jim Carrey in it as far as 'explicit' or 'vulgar' humor goes. Those are bad ways to describe it, but if you see the movie, you will know what I am driving at here. Renee Z is good in the movie and Carrey's sons in the movie bring needed laughs.
