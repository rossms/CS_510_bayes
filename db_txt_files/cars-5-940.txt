My parents got this car about July and i LOVE to drive it. It has good power, never breaks down, and is built well. Bad part is on the 2004 model the transmitton is bad and was recalled, so that sucks. But still is a very nice car. I highly suggest this car (don't get a 04 though because of trans probelms) Also get the leather interior its easier to keep clean and IS worth it..
