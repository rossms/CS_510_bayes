I graduated from the City College of New York where the essential experiences I valued where the wide socio-economic diversity of students; curriculi in comparative literature, english literature, cultural studies, art history and film studies that were very good, and professors who were engaging, provocative and fun. I loved being a student there. in order to do well at this school, you have to be independant and use the entire island of manhattan as your educational campus.
