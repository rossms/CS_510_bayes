So what that USC plays in the Pac-10? Im from Michigan and I am a Michigan fan, but i don't care what you all say, no matter where USC played they would win. Its not just about who you play, its about HOW you play. And anyone that has seen 5 minutes of a USC game would know that they are a amazing program.
