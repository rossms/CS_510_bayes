Normally I can't stand any music even approaching metal, but Appetite for Destruction is a different story. This CD was released when I was in high school, and I distinctly remember my friend's band covering Sweet Child 'O Mine, which sounded so good at the time. Appetite for Destruction is full of great, loud, angry, beer bottle smashing music that I would probably hate if I heard today for the first time.
