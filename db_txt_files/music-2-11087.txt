I liked this when it first came out (fun, pop fluff isn't all bad) but looking back on it now...I NEVER listen to it! Partly because the songs just don't DO anything for me, they seem aimed at middle schoolers and their ideas of romance and rebellion. And I just find the layout and production (not to mention Britney's run-thru-a-computer voice, which despite her popularity really is an acquired taste - and one I've yet to acquire!) a little juvenile. I don't want her fans to take this as a personal attack, but my honest opinion on this is that you'd be better off to pass it up.
