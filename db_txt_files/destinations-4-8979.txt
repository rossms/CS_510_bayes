As a former long time Copenhagen user I decided to switch brands due to ever increasing prices of Copenhagen. I ran across an online sale for Kayak Long Cut Straight and really enjoyed it ($1.75/5 tin roll). I must admit that Copenhagen is a superior product in all respects, but just not worth the extra money in my opinion. Kayak is manufactured by Swisher International, Inc. and I give it a hefty 4 stars. Again, if you don't mind spending $5.00/tin...stick with Copenhagen. But if you want to save some serious money I would suggest you give Kayak a try!
