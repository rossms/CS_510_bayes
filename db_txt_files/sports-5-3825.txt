Only Ruth is better. But it's early. Brett Favre 6'2'' 235. Barry Bonds 6'2'' 225. If Bonds is on roids then 85% of the NFL is too. If Favre uses protien shakes and dumbells then Bonds does too. One way or another nobody in baseball has had as many career HR's in almost 30 yrs and everyone agrees that players are bigger, faster, stronger and better than they were in the 1970's. In fact for it to take 30 years for someone to get 600 that shocks me. We were long overdue and give Barry some credit.
