Billyloon and Moosekarloff are just proving their ignorance by making such statements. Pitt has had more Rhodes and Marshall scholars in the past decade than ANY OTHER American college or university and is consistently receives some of the highest ratings for mostly all of their programs. It is also among the top 10 research institutions in the U.S. I'm guessing the hostility those two are putting out is because they couldn't quite post the requisite 1280 SAT score needed to get into main campus.
