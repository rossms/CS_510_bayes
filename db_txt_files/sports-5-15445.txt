Sometimes-- there is a very fine line between being a great athelete, and being idiot. Randy Moss has closed the gap. He proved that having great talent does not go hand in hand with having good sense, or using good judgement. I lost a lot of respect for Moss after he walked off the field the previous week. Then, he is given the opportunity to show everyone that he is really not an unproffessional egomaniac, but a true team player. Instead, he seals his fate as the vulgar fool 'most' paymakers/Dealmakers in the NFL thought he was. He is his own worse enemy, and he alone will take himself DOWN.
