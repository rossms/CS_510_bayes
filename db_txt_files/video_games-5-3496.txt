The graphics of this game were simply astounding. The fact that the entire setting is a smooth 3-D texture and many interactive characters just stunned me. In many instances I was very impressed by the cinematic sequences as well. The ending was particularly impressive, since the lead character is portrayed as being lost in time and subsequently separated from his lover, and then an unexpected turn of events forged their reunion. I was very touched.
