Sauza is my tequila of choice - Shame most bars that I go to don't have it. Much smoother, lighter and better taste then Cuervo. To the person said it leaves terrible headaches - that's a matter of who drinks it, as you get different effects with different people. I get terrible headaches with most wines, myself. I both suggest Sauza for shot and sipping, as I have enjoyed both ways. It works especially well with lime. I'm actually picking up a bottle of it for myself for New Years Eve :)
