this film traps the audience. it's placid first 60 minutes deadens the audience's expectations of the film. which makes the shocking finale ever so potent. this film is most effectively viewed with little or no prior context. if you have read this review - show the film to somebody who knows nothing of the film. that is where the true reactions can be gauged. this film is one of the most disturbing films made in the last decade. a must for those who believe they are desensitised.
