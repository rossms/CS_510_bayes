I am pretty sure that this was the first James Bond movie that I saw on the big screen and it was great. I was shocked to find out that one of the exotic beauties in the movie was once a man (years after I had seen the film originnally). For some reason, this movie has left me biased and I feel that Roger moore was the best actor to ever play James Bond.
