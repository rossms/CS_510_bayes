This game has a happy combination of strategy, vocabulary, and flexibility. Scrabble is one of those games that's fun for casual gamers but also rewards the more serious players. Plus, unlike other addictions, Scrabble leaves the fanatic with a larger vocabulary, better spelling, and a generally more agile mind. And if the regular game gets boring - or you need to level the playing field against word nerds - there are Phonetic Scrabble, Dirty Scrabble, and The Word of Apocalyptic Destruction variants (among endless others) to keep things exciting.
