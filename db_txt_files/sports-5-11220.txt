LLoyd is a class act that really cares about the kids and not himself. He is a great recruiter and a great motivator. The kids love him and would do anything to win for him. He is 17-4 vs Top Ten teams, which is outstanding, and has the third best winning percenatge out of active coaches. I believe with a new QB and bringing back Mike DeBord to soley concentrate on the Special Teams, LLoyd Carr will win one more NC before he retires in 5 years.
