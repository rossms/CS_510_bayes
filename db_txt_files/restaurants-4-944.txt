Subway has good sandwiches. They are not of deli quality, but they are edible. I like the turkey breast they serve on their sandwiches. They are kinda' expensive, where a regular six inch value meal can cost up to $5.00 or more. They need to lower prices, I think, they are a little high for a fast food chain.
