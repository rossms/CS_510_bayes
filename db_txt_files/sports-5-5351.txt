Kirk Hinrich is the best all around guard in the NCAA. He is unselfish and still averages 17 a game. He can take you to the rim and he shoots from every where. Not to mention he works the 3 point line like a part time job. He can handle the ball nicely and he is real quick. And he probably has the best fundamentals out of anyone in college basketball. He is also a good passer. You can't stop him so why even try. Hes a 6'3 white kid who can dunk with two hands like his mama taught him, easily. Get off of him!
