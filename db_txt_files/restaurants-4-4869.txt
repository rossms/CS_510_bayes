They make good pancakes, and I love the choice of different flavored syrups. The syrups make it worthwhile for me for some reason. Once in a great while I'll let myself have the incredibly high calorie, but so incredibly delicious strawberry waffles or pancakes, with those yummy strawberries and all that whipped cream! MMMMM!
