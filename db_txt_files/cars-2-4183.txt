The Outback gets so much undeserved and unwanted attention. Its been unreliable, small, and underpowred for the price. Prices for these wagons max out around $35,000- you can get an 8 passenger Expedition with that! Cargo room is small, even for a wagon, the Taurus Wagon has more room for less money. Plus, the Taurus Wagon can hold 8 people. Subaru claims this is a Sport Utility Wagon , even though the Outback is based on a sedan. There hasen't been a SUW made yet- Cadillac might have one with the SRX.
