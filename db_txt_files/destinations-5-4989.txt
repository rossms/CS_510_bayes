Very restful and beautiful state to visit, very decent place to live. Clean, quiet, underdeveloped (especially up north), close to the Maritime provinces, low crime rate, affordable cost of living, low keyed and progessive people living there. The topography is stunning. Close enough to Boston, one of the best U.S. cities, in the event you get the smalltown heebee geebees. Several very good colleges there. Weather can be daunting in Winter, however, and making a decent living might be an issue. I imagine this is one of the best locations for retirement.
