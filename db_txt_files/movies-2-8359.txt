Big is an extremly silly movie starring Tom Hanks, in one of his strangest roles ever to hit the theaters. A young boy goes to a carnival and uses one of those fourtune telling machines, and it tell him that he will age overnight. He awakens in the morning to find that he is a 30-year old man working at a toy company in New York City. Fan of Tom Hanks may go for it, but others may want to stay away.
