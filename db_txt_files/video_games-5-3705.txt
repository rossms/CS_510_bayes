There is only one word to describe Syphon Filter, Perfect! It is the best game ever! The focus of the game is to stop a disease from being sold to terrorists. This game is very realistic. When you use the taser on an enemy they actually scream and catch on fire. The missions are challenging. I only beat the game because of cheats and the strategy guide.
