If you like over-priced stuff this area is for you. I think its silly that people pay so much to be in what is the least diverse, boring neighborhood in Denver. This neighborhood has tons of Yuppies (yuk!!!), I personally think Capitol Hill and anywhere along Colfax is much more interesting than this area of Denver.
