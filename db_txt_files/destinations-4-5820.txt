I am a Wisconsinite. I do agree it is a good state, but our property taxes are getting horrid. It depends where you live. I live in a southeastern suburb of Milwaukee county, and our taxes are going up 30 to 35%. My sister lives in Racine county, and she has a newer house(30 years old). She pays less property tax than we do compared to what we pay on our 100 year old house. If my mother passed away, i would move to northern Wisconsin because it is a cheaper area to live.
