For years McDonald's has attempted to thwart its competitors using every gimmick from commercial tie-ins to McDonald's Playlands. When that didn't work, they flooded every SMSA and census tract in every metro area with restaurants. The only thing they have forgotten- It's The Food Stupid! Virtually all taste tests ever given rate their hamburgers (Big Macs, Quarter Pounders, etc.) poorer than flame- broiled; and the rest of the menu rates below average on taste and quality.
