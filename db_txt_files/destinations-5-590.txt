I agree 100% with cbru532du. Grenada is grossly underrated. I have been there many times and trust me, its beautiful. Great people,Great beaches, nice hotels, good music, good food.And of course the wheather is beautiful as well. I especially reccomend going there during August when Grenada holds its 2 day Carnival fest. Grenada is a true gem!
