01 Sonata, 66k miles. Drive it everyday for work. After all this time and mileage, I have no doubt that the Sonata is one of the best values for the money. If money was no object I would drive another car, but i am very happy with the Sonata. Small issues: 4 cyl idle is a little rough, air bag light came on twice. My next car will be a Hyundai.
