The Escape is every thing I hoped it would be. Goes anywhere I could want in bad weather, snow, rail, hail because of the auto 4x4. Very comfortable to drive and lets me haul feed and/or friends. It has the power to pass other vehicles even on narrow 2 lane highways, handles with ease and gives a quiet smooth ride. I'm very glad I have one and i'ts Yellow.
