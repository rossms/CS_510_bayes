What a moron. He decides NOT to run with the Green Party this time arounnd but then gets mad when they don't give him endorsments...He's an egotistical nimrod that only cares about stirring things up. Not the fact that he doesn't have a prayer in hell to win the White House so all he's doing is sitting there stealing votes from Kerry...
