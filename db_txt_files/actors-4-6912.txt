Dune, The Hidden, Twin Peaks, Showgirls, Trey in Sex and the City, the guy has some talent. Not exactly a mainstrean actor but someone who brings a little something ot the table in a role. Kinda reminds me of Peter Gallagher, another actor who has done some pretty good work in the roles given to him. Solid to good stuff that makes an impression on you and that's the sign of a good actor so I guess I gotta give him Four stars.
