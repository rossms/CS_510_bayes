I love vanilla with chocolate sprinkles. I don't think I've even tried anything else in the past 10 years that I've been eating there, and I'm usually one to try new things as often as possible! They're still just as good as they have always been. Don't be afraid of frozen yogurt... it's nothing weird (for those who haven't tried it) ... I promise you'll like it!
