this is probably one of the best country CDs released since 2000. if it can even be called county. a wall-of-sound late night blues and honky-tonk explosion of wronged love, if i ever heard one. man, eras of musical women from patsy cline to dolly parton and emmylou harris, not to mention spector singers like Ronnie Spector came to mind when i first heard this album. this is defintely one of those discs to play on a lonely brooding night at 3am. make sure you have some whiskey handy.
