Pat Buchanan was the most powerful columnist in America from the mid-1970s to the mid-1980s. He was the very reason I started reading the editorial page. And for several years, there was no prominent writer who expressed my views like he could. But in recent years, he has changed several of his positions and I don't really enjoy him like I used to. Still, I rate him great because he is a man of principle who will stand up for what he believes, no matter who likes or doesn't like it. It's hard to think of anyone else who is that courageous and independent.
