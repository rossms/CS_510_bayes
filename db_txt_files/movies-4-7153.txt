Genuinely funny, and there's nothing suble about the humor. This is the best thing Chevy Chase ever did. The only uncomfortable thing about it is that it reminds me so much of the summer vacations our family used to take...there are so many similarities that I wonder if someone in Hollywood had us under surveillance all those years.
