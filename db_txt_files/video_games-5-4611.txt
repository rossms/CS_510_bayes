In Zoo Tycoon 2, you can build your own Sea World, Bronx Zoo, and Jurassic park. There are many diverse species to choose from. I want to share my favorite cheats....1. Name an empty exhbit-Xanadu. Go back to the animals list and you would get a unicorn. 2. Buy a mermaid statue and place it in an empty water tank. A mermaid come out. I got these tips from Cheat Underground. Try it!
