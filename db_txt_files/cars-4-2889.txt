Definly the 4th generation maros are better than the 4th generation mustang, 5.7 compared to a 4.6 enough said. Old maros are alright but nothing like a 70 gs 455 stage 1 or a 69-71 442 or late 60 early 70 gto Oh yeah, F**K GM for discontinuing the Maros and Fbirds, new gto ok but ugly, plain, Austrailian styling.
