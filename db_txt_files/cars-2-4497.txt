Our 1995 Windstar has been and still is a rolling nightmare. We like it's comfort, handling and ease of driving-WHEN it is driveable. It is in the shop more often than not- heads, transmission, frequent brakes replacements- see more at www.lastfat.com/ford/ Good luck to all you other suckers owning a '95 Windstar.
