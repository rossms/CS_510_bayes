Cingular kicks ass. I have had Cingular for almost one year and I have to say that is the best cell phone provider. I have never had a problem with any of my bills and the customer service rocks where I'm at. They have the best phones and the best plans at the best prices. I used to have Verizon Wireless and I got outrageous bills every month because Verizon Wirelss does not know how to work as a unit. Always had dropped calls with Verizon as well. Cingular is the best and since they merged with AT&T, they are even more powerful and Cingular is only going to get better.
