Could this movie get any more preachy? The special effects are a wonder, save for the scene with the animated wolves, but honestly, I've seen enough of Captain Planet when I was younger to know what environmentalist propaganda looks like. The poorly-disguised caricature of Dick Cheney was also unnecessary.
