The thing that sold me on Kirsten Dunst was definitely her portrayal of Claudia in Interview.. . But I loved her in Dick , too. She has a sunniness about her that makes one want to bask in the glow of her smile. Her talent and her charm keep us watching! I gave her four stars because although she has proved to be a great actress, I think her best is yet to come.
