They are so good. I love the creamy texture of the inside. I am not a fan of dark chocolate but it is a thin layer that is just enough to tolerate. Beware of eating them in the movie theaters because if you drop one and can't find it, you will stand up at the end of the movie with a melted one on your clothes. I speak from experience.
