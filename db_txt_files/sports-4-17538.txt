The geriatric unit comes together for another year. The cap really hurt them, and a strong draft is going to be necessary for them to compete in the AFC West. Gannon is a genius, Rice and Brown play better than Jordan ever thought at 40, and the secondary has tremendous POTENTIAL. But potential doesn't mean jack if you don't play up to it.
