No Beatles album will get less than 4 stars from me, but this one pains me to listen to, and not because of the music. The band was falling apart when they recorded it. It's amazing that they pulled Abbey Road off (which was recorded after Let it Be, but released BEFORE it). Phil Spector's touches add a lot to the record (I have to disagree with McCartney, and go with Harrison on this one--Spector worked wonders with Across the Universe, Let it Be and The Long and Winding Road). Let it Be Naked, the album McCarntney envisioned it, came out last year and didn't cut it for me.
