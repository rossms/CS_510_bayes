Have had our Astro since 1996. It's been a very reliable van, no major problems. There were a couple of things that were taken care of under warranty right after we got the van (prob w/ power windows--bad switch, and a prob with the interior lights). Other than that, it's been great. Just keep up on your tire rotations! :-)
