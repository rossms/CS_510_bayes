What the HELL was that movie about???? Halle Berry is a wonderful actress. No, she is not great.... I'm sorry... Beautiful lady - yes. Great actress - I don't see it. What the hell was the OSCAR for? I really believe, the committee felt that it was time to give this award to a black actress. The movie Losing Isiah was a much better movie. Halle please don't lower yourself by taking off your clothes for every movie. It's not a good thing. Oh on the black thing. YOU ARE NOT BLACK SWEETHEART. You're mother has blond hair.
