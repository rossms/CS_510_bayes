I have a 1995 windstar that blew a head gasket. This is a huge problem that ford won't help its customers with. I'm thoroughly disgusted with the ford company. In addition, the dealership that replaced my engine ($4500.00) was disreputable and did further damage to my van and won't make things right (K H Ford, Mechanicsburg,PA.)
