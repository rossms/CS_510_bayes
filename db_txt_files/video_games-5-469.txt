A good game that encourages greed. My strategy was to buy every single peice of property I landed on, even if I had to mortage everything to afford it. This game generally lasts so long that the properties you acquire prove way more valuable than the few hundred you have to spend on them. In addition, you never know when the random property you have will become useful in a trade.
