what a great book for young people to read in school. It teaches so much about the horrors of the Holocaust and what some had to do to survive.Anne went into hiding right after her 13th birthday and was there for over two years. Her diary describes what like was like in those two years. she was a good writer for a young teenager.I have read that her diary is one of the most read books in the world. How sad that this did not have a happy ending.
