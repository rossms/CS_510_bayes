The Escort was the greatest small car Ford ever built. It had good looks, sipped fuel, was very reliable, and NOTHING could beat it when it came to rallying, other than the all-conquering Audi Quattro. I liked the syling on the Escort (I think it looked much better than the Focus) and liked the coupes in its final years. I wish they had never replaced it.
