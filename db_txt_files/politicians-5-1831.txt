This man is doing the best anyone could do in Massachusetts. Our state is in a huge deficiet, and its not going away. Shannon O'Brian would definetely have raised taxes. Mitt Romney promised not to raise taxes but cut unnessecerry programs and such. I think that programs should have been cut instead of instituting more taxes. But either one or the other had to be done. I also applad him for trying to bring back the death penalty to the state.
