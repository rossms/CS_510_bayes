I have a 1998 Toyota Corolla LE and havent had a major problem yet! The only thing I don't like about it is the back floor space is crampy and the sun visor is too close to the rearview mirror other than that Its a great economical Little car and great gas mileage. It looks like they improved significly with the new 2003 Corollas with more floor room in the back and better exterior style especially the sport model.
