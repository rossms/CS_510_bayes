Keep up the good work. We're behind you. There are several people in our workplace who stand behind you 100%. We are tired of the lies and deception than Al Gore has spread. We want a man with YOUR convictions and morals. It's time we had a man that is not ashamed to pray in the White House. In our opinion, you have already won the presidential race. Keep your chin up. Our prays are with you.
