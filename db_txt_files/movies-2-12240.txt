I refer to the 1966 version with Michael Caine. I didn't bother to see the 2004 remake. This is not a funny movie, so I don't know why it is here. Caine is a misogynistic Cockney playboy who finds his philandering world to be increasing empty. I thought the movie was dark and offputting. If it were in a drama section, I would give it a four.
