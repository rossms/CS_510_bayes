Yes, it was occasionally tedious to read this, but I think it was worth it. It's amazing how Joyce was able to take a perfectly ordinary day in the life of a perfectly ordinary man and make it so fascinating and surreal. A brilliant book which is alternately thought-provoking, hilarious, revolting, terrifying and poignant, but as far as Joyce goes it's simply another feather in his cap. Yes.
