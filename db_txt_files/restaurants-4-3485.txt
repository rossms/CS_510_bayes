I just ate Pizza Hut for dinner last night! I never ate it that much as a kid but I've gotten into it more now as an adult. My only complaint is that the pizza is a bit overly greasy, but other than that. it's pretty good. The toppings are tasty and fresh, and I LOVE their buttery Pan Pizza crust- nice and cripsy. I had the thin crust last night and it was pretty good. They could do a better job on keeping the pizza hot before they get it to your door, though!
