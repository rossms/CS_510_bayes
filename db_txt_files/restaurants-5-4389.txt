I believe for the value and the quantity, Cracker Barrel is one of the best, inexpensive restaurants out there. The food is good, they don't skimp on the portions, they serve REAL butter and pure maple syrup; most restaurants can't say the same. I think their service is very good. And to the nay-sayers: maybe there is a reason there is a line outside and you have to wait.
