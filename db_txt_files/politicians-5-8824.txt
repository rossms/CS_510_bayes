Loved this President! Yes, he had a sexual peccadillo; many across the political spectrum do, so what's the point of singling Clinton out? I guess that's what people do who, try as they might, can't find anything else to criticize in an otherwise formidable political opponent. Yes, he had human shortcomings, like we all do, in some form. Clinton is a very decent man of fine intellect and sharp wit. He knew what NOT to do to foul up the economy. A very sensible man.
