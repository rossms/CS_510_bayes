Yet another pop/punk hybrid. Some of the songs are decent I guess. But mainly they just annoy me... I'd rather listen to real punk (what I consider real punk is because of the music not because of what punk means) such as Sex Pistols... if I am going to listen to this hybrid music, then I'm gonna go to Blink who can at least do it well.
