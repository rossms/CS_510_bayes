I agree with Ruby's assessment of History of the American People by Paul Johnson. It is so refreshing to read an account of American history that is not slanted by the author's personal agenda. Most U.S. historians are propoganda machines for the far left. It is also refreshing to have it re-affirmed that the United Kingdom is by far America's greatest international friend. A friendship we take for granted.
