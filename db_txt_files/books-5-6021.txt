I've liked all of the Richard North Patterson books I've read and just finished No Safe Place -- thought it was the best until I started the one that follows it: Protect and Defend. Although I'm only about halfway through the book, it's even better. Appointing a new Chief Justice to the Supreme Court opens up all kinds of interesting twist and turns of the plot. I can hardly wait to get back to the book!!
