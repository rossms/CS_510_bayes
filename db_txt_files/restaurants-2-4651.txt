At the risk of sounding like an idiot (after all it's casual dining): Friday's has taken a real downturn over the last ten years in my estimation-that or I have become more discerning? I stumble into a Friday's about once every six months usually as as a matter of expedience in getting fed and I can not think of the last time I had a pleasantly uneventful meal there. Without fail items on the menu are not available, service is subpar, the hot food is served warm to cold or the desserts are plated incorrectly. I always walk out upset that I bothered trying it again.
