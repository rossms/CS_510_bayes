I spent alot of time in Bimini during my teenage years. I have thousands of dives there and I have even spent a summer on one of scuba Bimini's old boats, BIG BIRD. Make sure you always wear gloves and bring a flashligt, flourescent if you can. Go to the end of the world the sand bar and ask for a back pack. Enjoy your time there and go get a burger and conch fritters at CJ's.
