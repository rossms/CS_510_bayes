absolutly the best player ever, not only in basketball, but all team sports. I've been a NBA fan since 1965 (I'm 47 years olds), this is the only player I have ever seen who posseses NO weaknesses. offense, defense, rebounding, passing, intensity, ballhandling, teamwork, confidence, speed, strenght, conditioning, everything. the only other player that came close: Oscar Robinson.
