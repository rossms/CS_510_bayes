Reagan had the ability to reach out and touch Americans across all lines. Unlike President Carter, who seemed not to believe in America's greatness, Reagan did. His raising of defense spending and Star Wars bankrupted the Soviet Union. Eventually leading to the fall of communism. Previous presidents were willing to play tie with the overrated empire. Reagan knew he could topple it and he did. And the fact he believed in the potential of the American people and got us to believe in ourselves again.
