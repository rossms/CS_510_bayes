I`ve been a Braves fan for many years. I`ve seen them at their worst, and i`ve also seen them at their best, My favourite is definatly Greg Maddux. I used to live in Jacksonville where Chipper Jones was at Bolles HS. Keeping my fingers crossed for a WS win in 2004. Whether they win or lose they`ll always be #1 to me. To the fans who diss the Braves....at least they don`t start fights becasue someone decides to root for the other side bad sportmenship indeed. I`ve never liked the Yankees but after that disgusting display I like them even less.
