Setting aside the culture, (because I just want to rate the state) Utah is a gorgeous state. Southern Utah is filled with many National Parks including Zions, Bryce, Arches, Canyonlands, and Capitol Reef, and that doesn't even include the National Monuments. Southern Utah has a very unique geography that is hard to match. The state is in the midst of the Rocky Mountains which are beautiful and exciting to ski, snowboard, and hike. This is a naturally beautiful state.
