A very pretty, clean city with some interesting architecture. Located right by the sea with some beaches you can swim off, and some nice parks and islands for chilling out. It's small compared to a lot of capitals but has plenty to do - altho the nightlife is mainly hidden away on streets like Bulevardi, Uudenmaankatu - not in the most obvious place so many tourists never find the good stuff. Try to find the sauna bar! Go in the summer if you can for the best weather and the midsummer festival when it's light almost all night
