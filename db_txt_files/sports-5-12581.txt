Say what you want about Spurrier (I can't stand him), but they win year in and year out. Nothing but bitter Canes and Noles fans who must be bringing the Gators' rating down on this site. Last year (2000) was a down year for them. Yet, with a very young team, they still won ten games With 18 returning starters, they're the 2001 pre-season #1 in most polls and will be in the national championship hunt.
