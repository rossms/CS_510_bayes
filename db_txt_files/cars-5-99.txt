Alright, i just bought a honda 450r a week ago and right after I got the first twenty four hours in I raced a yfz 450 and left it behind badly.i dont care about you Yamaha lovers anyway, just cuz u cant handle a 450r doesnt mean that you have to tell other ppl that it stinks. I recommend that anyone get this fourwheeler. I have White brothers pipes,a supercharger,nitrous,camshafts and a lot more. If your looking for a new four wheeler then get the new Honda 450R!!!! You'll blow them off the road.... Oh yea my fourwheeler is now running at 98 mph.
