Yao is good and gaining consistancy. If the Houston guards would pass him the rock more he'd have better numbers. He also passes off double teams nicely. His FG% is great. He needs to be more aggressive and dunk more, call for the ball etc. He needs to play against everyone the way he gears up for playing Shaq.
