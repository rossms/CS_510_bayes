The best horror movie I've seen in a while, with a nice killer twist at the end. Kate Hudson really surprised me; I had pegged her more as a affable, if saccharine, romantic lead than a thriller heroine, but she gives the character of Caroline a demeanor that's at once intelligent, determined, and magnanimous. It's certainly a fresh break from the usual bimbo tripping over set pieces to escape the monster. Set in the marshes of Louisiana, a native folk magic called hoodoo factors heavily into the film's plot, so you may have to suspend skepticism to enjoy this one. Definitely worth a look.
