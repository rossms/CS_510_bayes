I really enjoyed this movie when I was younger to be honest with you, the idea of little people running around beneath the floorboards and through the city, trying to save their home, I remember watching it often after it came out on video. I honestly haven't watched it in years, so the perspective of a little kid changes quite a bit when they become young adults.
