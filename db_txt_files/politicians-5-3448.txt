I like GWB, at least he aint a homo like John Kerry. Hey lets all vote Kerry, maybe he can get France to like us. We all know how helpful they are in a war. W is the man, and if He fought John Querry he would kick his ass. That is how I vote. Who can kick whos ass. Now I know some of the Kerry fans will want to pull up Kerry Nam record. Pull it up, hell he served four measly months and got released because of self inflicted wounds. Vote Bush not just cause I like him, because Jesus likes him.
