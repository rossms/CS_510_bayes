You can count on Starbucks. The coffee is great, and the stores are managed well. I appreciate the way you never have to wait in line for very long, even when there's a crowd, and the servers are always friendly (it's probably the caffeine). In my opinion, the house blend is the best coffee, but the others I've tried have been very good, too. When I'm out of town, I always look for the nearest Starbucks so that I can get my morning fix. There's nothing worse than being in a small town without a Starbucks!
