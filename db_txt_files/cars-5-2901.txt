i love some of the retards that rated this car...all they basically said was i dont like it and thats it...if the car sucks , y the hell cant u people give good reasons why? the camaro's one of the 1st muscle cars ever, and it's lasted over 30 years, a kick-ass car 4 the money too...yes, other cars can beat the crap outta it, but how much do they cost. i'll bet anyone that for the price of any car that can beat the camaro, i could buy a new ss, hook it up, and piss all over your fancy sports cars!
