It looks like Ralph Nader has been integral in electing George W. Bush our President. If that is indeed the case he needs to keep quiet over the next 4 years with any criticism he has for that administration. Ralph Nader has been important as a consumer advocate and he should stick to that I do not respect him at all for his effect on this presidential race.
