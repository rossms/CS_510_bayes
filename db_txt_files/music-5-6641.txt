I knew right away that it would be a quality record knowing that the Crue were making it. But I never expected this. This is the best album I have ever heard, right from the first song Hell On High Heels all the way to White Punks On Dope . And then the Crue put a little gem in the middle called New Tattoo this killer love ballad which in my oppion will soon be classic. Don't pass up the opportunity to add one of the best compilations of music to be put together to your collection, you won't be disappointed.
