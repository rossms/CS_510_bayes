I have loved Claire since her role on My-So-Called life. She is adorable/beautiful. She is exactly the type i would want as a little sister. She stole my heart in Brokedown Palace, when she gave up freedom for her best friend. I watched that movie with my own best friend and we had an awesome cry over it. She is versatile in her movie roles as well. She has the potential for greatness, and i hope she takes it all the way.
