This movie isn't really scary but it's still a great movie.Tim Burton is awesome and hasn't disappointed me yet.The setting and scenery were brilliant. I thought Burton did an awesome job considering the original story line he had to work with.I supose it could have used a little more suspense but all in all its worth watching.
