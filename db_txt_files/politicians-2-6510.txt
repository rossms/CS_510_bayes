Lacking in conviction and an ineffective leader. Is literally in bed with the airline industry. Only accomplishments of note were convincing the more honest Democrats who were inclined to support impeachment among them Feingold, Byrd, and Hollings not to, and in briefly gaining control of Senate, which he almost instantly squandered by mishandling debate on Iraq war and 02 Senate campaigns. Not as stupid or loathsome as Lott but that's faint praise; seems outclassed by Frist.
