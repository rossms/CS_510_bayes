I was considering an Infiniti G35 Sport Coupe, but the 2004 Vette is a better value hands-down, especially now that GM is discounting what is left of the C5's as the C6 is coming out soon. The C5 is better-looking than the C6 inside and out. The C5 is an absolute steal- great performance, styling, reliability, gas mileage, HUD display, cargo room with the hatch on the Coupe model, great-looking wheels, removable roof! Awesome! The only American car worth considering by far!
