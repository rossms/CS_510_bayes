Even if you don't like baseball, you'll like Wrigley Field. It's in one of the best neighorhoods in Chicago, the L train runs right to it, and it's a genuine ballpark - few ads, and every seat is good. Only Fenway, Camden, Yankee, and (surprisingly) Coors begin to approach the quality of this ballpark.
