This place is like coming home to an old hillbilly like me. Home cooked food and a family reunion type atmosphere. The service is more than adequate. The menu is extensive and the posibilities endless. I have never tried anything at one of these places that I did not enjoy. The old Country Store is a great place to wax nostalgic for older folks while the younger crowd will be amazed to see such simplistic novelties. Take the family and enjoy.
