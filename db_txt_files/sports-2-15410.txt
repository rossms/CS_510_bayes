Overrated...When he played a good defense like New England, he played like complete crap, and eventually in the playoffs, you're going to play a great defense, so I never see him winning it all. Not only that, he's probably the most boring qb to watch. Even when he's gone, his highlights will all be of Marvin Harrison making great catches
