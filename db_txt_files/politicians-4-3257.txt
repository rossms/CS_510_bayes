I am not afraid to say that I voted for this man. As President, he has done wonderful things for this country. I would probably vote for him again if he could run. Whatever moral issues he has are his to deal with in time. They are between himself, his family and his God. I agree with the person who said, I wouldn't want to be in his shoes on judgment day, but that doesn't make him a bad president. He is one the best. I will remember him for what he did for the country, not for the mistakes he made as a man.
