I enjoy this CD a lot because I think they are a great band. I love the up beat rhythm in their songs and the songs themselves are good because they're fun to listen to. The only reason I gave it a 4 instead of a 5 is because I could totally see if some people found the lyrics a little offensive. But since I don't, it's a great CD!
