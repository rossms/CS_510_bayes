If you're going to London, I recommend a stop at the British Museum. Check out the Rosetta Stone and the amazing Egyptian collection. Like any other old city, an appreciation of London's history can really enhance a visit. I read Churchill's 'History of the Second World War' while I was there, and it really gave me a better appreciation of the city's personality and character.
