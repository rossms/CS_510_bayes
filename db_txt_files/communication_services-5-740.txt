I've heard they have some reception issues in the continental US, but in Hawaii it works great. Remember one thing, reception problems are not always the service providers fault, the phone plays a big part in this also. I've had Sprint for almost four years and have tried many of their different phones. Some worked great, some didn't, and the ones that didn't work were the cheaper models (usually below $200).
