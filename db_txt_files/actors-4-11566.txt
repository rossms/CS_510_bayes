She's been good in the roles she has played, but they are ALL THE SAME. I think she has more talent that we ever get to see. She's cute , so she gets the boy meets girl and falls in love roles (I loved her in When Harry Met Sally - my fav. movie of all time), but I'd love to see her in more challenging roles, such as the one she played in When A Man Loves A Woman . She's lovely!
