This is up there as one of my top 3 favorite beers. When could you not have a Heineken? Never. Heineken fits every situation. You can have one with dinner. You can have one when you have already had 10. With some beers (like really dark ones like guiness, or really sweet beers like ciders) you can only have one or two before you have to switch it up, but with Heineken, it can take you the whole night through. It is light but not fluffy like some light beers, it tastes great. It is refreshing. It is just an all time great beer. It is making me thirsty as I write this.
