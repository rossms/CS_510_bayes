What can I say, about Doritos, a lot. But only a few things can be covered. First, the 3 dimensional ones are not all that great, they do not have as much flavor as the original type. What Doritos do have is a lot of flavor, which is good for any food. Of all of the flavors i have to rank Taco as the best, then cheese and cool ranch.
