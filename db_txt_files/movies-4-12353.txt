good movie. if someone likes musicals this is pretty good. the songs are okay. but the acting and plot can be hilarious. I saw the original comedy years ago and this version holds up. Nathan lane is great as Max Bioliastock. and Will Farrell is funny as the Nazi playright.had some very good funny scenes especially the ones with Will Farrell. takes place in the late 50s.Uma Thurman and Matthew Broderick are fine too in their roles.
