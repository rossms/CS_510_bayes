One of the half dozen or so truly great figures in the history of the college game. Look for much improvement with this years squad. The 1994 team was a powerhouse, certainly the best team in the nation. Even I would have liked to have had a playoff that year, (although not before or since). I'm sure that Joe has thought about his exit strategy , and when he's ready to retire, he will. It is HIS career, and really not anyone elses business.
