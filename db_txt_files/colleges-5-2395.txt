The best and biggest comprehensive university center in the 2nd largest state in the country. Great facilities, faculty, cirriculum and some VERY bad weather;-)A cost effective choice if you live in NY, which most do and something like 50% of the students are from NYC. Med school , law school and many departments rank high on the Gourman Report. Just bring warm clothes;-)
