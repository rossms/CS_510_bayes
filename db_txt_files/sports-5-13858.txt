Never saw the guy play but from what most say, he along with Jim Brown are the two greatest ever. That is the consensus. The thing that i hear about him all the time was that he was a relentless runner, never running out of bounds despite his small stature. And i think he was very durable, i think he missed just a couple games his whole career but could be wrong.
