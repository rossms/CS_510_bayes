If I have to venture into a big discount store, I go to Target. The stores are always clean, and the aisles are wide enough to navigate a cart. I rarely have to wait long in line at Target, which is always a big plus. The selection of merchandise is fairly extensive and consistent, as opposed to a place like Wal-Mart where it's hit-or-miss.
