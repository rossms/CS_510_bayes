The only reason I don't give it five stars is because the soundtrack does not contain the version of I'll Fly Away that is heard in the film. Even then, this is better than 99.9 percent of the soundtracks out there. I'm sure this was because of some copyrighting red tape and I understand that. If anyone else wants the version heard in the film, go to the Barnes and Noble website and search for The Kossoy Sisters album Bowling Green . It's a great album in itself. I have to say that the version by Alison Krauss and Gillian Welch is VERY good, but not as good as the Kossoy Sisters.
