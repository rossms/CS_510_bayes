When I'm not enveloped in music, I eat a lot of candy. I am basically an expert in candy. Now and Laters are refreshingly delicious. The flavors are simply delightful. However, after eating so many of them, one gets tired of the same flavors. I think they should continually add new flavors just as Jolly Ranchers does. If they do this, I will remember this candy when I am old and gray with two teeth in my head!
