one of my favorite movies. a poor kid gets a little luck when he finds a candy bar that contains one of five golden tickets. he gets to go to the chocolate factory owned by Willy Wonka. Mischeif occurs when some of the kids get greedy and suffer the consequences. Gene wilder is both good and creepy as wonka. the movie had a nice ending. give it a try.
