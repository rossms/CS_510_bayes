There were very few things about Calgary that I was impressed with, number one would be the beautiful scenery. The ugliest thing was how rude most of the people were to us when we there. I would never care to visit the city again. There maybe more to Calgary than what we saw, but who would want to put up with the rudeness long enough to see it? No thanks...
