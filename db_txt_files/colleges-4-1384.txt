Hey, I'm one of those townies you're referring to and I totally disagree with the person who said the local population doesn't get along with the students! Have you ever seen one of the football games? The entire town comes out to show their support. Adults love it because the university provides a youthfulness to the town; business owners love it because it provides a market; high-schoolers love it because of the partying opportunities it presents.
