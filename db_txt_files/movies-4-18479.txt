One of the better scary movies in that you really don't know who the killers is until the end. It could be anyone. Well acted, thoughtful, witty, a rebirth for the horror genre. Neither sequel comes even close to it. Reminds you of Halloween in that respect, a psychological thrill ride that denegrates into simple blood, guts and gore in it's sequels. Highly recommended!
