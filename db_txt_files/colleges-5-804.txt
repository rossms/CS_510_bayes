I've had a very positive experience with UoP. You have to want your degree to endure the sometimes grueling assignments. It's a great learning environment but not for the weak. I encourage anyone who is ready to finish their degree to try it. Like with most things in life, you will find what you are looking for if you try hard enough. If you choose to find negativity, you will and vice versa.
