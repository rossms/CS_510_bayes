Like most of the kids my age I was totally blown away by this album and movie when they came out. While I haven't seen it in 20 years, and it may be that long since I listened to the album, I'm prettty sure that it won't have aged particularly well. On the other hand, although its grandious to the point of obesity, I'm sure if you let yourself get into it you could still enjoy the freakishness of it and admire the craft in its production.
