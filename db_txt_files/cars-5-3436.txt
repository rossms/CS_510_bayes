I bought my 2001 Rav4 about a month ago and I love it! It's fun to drive and really comfortable and it gets decent gas mileage. It also holds lots of stuff which I appreciate, since I always used my car to haul stuff. The only complaint I have is that it doesn't have ABS. Of course I didn't have ABS before and it wasn't a problem, so it's probably okay now, too.
