holy crap, when you watch the film, it doesn't look like he's that fast but then why does it seem like everybody else in the picture that's chasing him look like they runnin in slo-mo? needs to protect the ball better tho, he's a little fumble prone. he's got a crazy strong arm too. mike vick, who woulda known the hype was real?
