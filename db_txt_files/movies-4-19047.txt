Very intense, very creepy movie. There wasn't much gore, so that was a plus. I was also impressed by Johnny Depp's performance, but I was a little disappointed by the ending. I predicted the end about half-way through, and although it was a surprise ending, I left the movie feeling unfulfilled. Otherwise, good movie if you like suspense and psychological thrillers.
