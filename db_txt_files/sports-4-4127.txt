Crum has an impressive resume but not quite enough in my mind to reach a 5. A 4 1/2 rounded up certainly. A great coach who had a style all is own. Not to be overlooked is the excellent skill learned while assisting Wooden and UCLA to 3 championships. Can Pitino replace Crum as Louisville all-time greatest head coach?
