I was looking for a book and called half price books to see if they had it in stock. The clerk answered the phone and immediately put me on hold. Then, when he did return to the phone he yelled at me are you on a cell phone, I can't hear you . He was rude and took my name to call me back on my request for a book in stock. Maybe he'll call me back one day.
