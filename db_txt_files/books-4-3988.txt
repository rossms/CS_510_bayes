This is a political commentary based in the fictional world of a farm where the animals take over. Definately bizarre, it is a satire of communism with an interesting twist. I had to read it for school many years ago, and I think it would have been nicer to have a better background of the actual things that Orwell was commenting on (from school); now that I do have a better knowledge, it is much more interesting.
