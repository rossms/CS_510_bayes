I hadn't heard of this until I saw it reviewed on RIA and I sure am glad I got it. I wasn't aware of how much crap gets loaded onto your computer just by surfing the net. I downloaded Ad-aware (free, from Download.com) and ran it for the first time on Saturday. The first scan identified and removed 855(!) programs that, unbeknownst to me, had been running on my computer every time I turned it on. Needless to say, the computer I thought was slow just because it was old, is now running ridiculously fast. I can't believe Ad-aware is free.
