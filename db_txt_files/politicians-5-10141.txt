All you Democrats quit whining. Bush won, he's a great president, and you all are just sad that your phoney hero Kerry didn't win. What you think we're just going to let terrorists take over the world? You peace loving pacifist hippies need to take a look at reality! The world has changed, and if we're not in the front of it to keep America they way we want it, we will be done. If you don't like Bush or his policies, move to Canada or France, You'll like it much better there.
