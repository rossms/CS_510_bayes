The media is already saying he is the best player on our team, and he hasn't even played yet. That is scary. He might be overhyped, but if he was going to start for an NBA team had he entered the draft, I'm sure he is ready for the ACC. The challenge will be being emotionally and mentally ready for the intensity of ACC play. Physically and talent wise, he is as ready as he'll ever be. Sean May is quoted as saying nobody could stop him in the summer pickup games which often included pros playing. That is a good sign.
