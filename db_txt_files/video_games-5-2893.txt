The best racer out there. Gives players the opportunity to race at a high-end competetive level. Unlike other racers (need for speed, etc..) GT4 gives players ultimate realism. Cars will not do somersaults and 2 kilometre long powerslides. A game intended for race enthusiasts, probably will not appeal to people who do not appreciate the hard work and dedication needed for becoming a professional racer. Many hours of fun to be had with this one, excellent graphics.
