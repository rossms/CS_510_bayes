Movies usually don't scare me, and there have been a select few that have been able to give me goosebumps. I'm a sucker for atmosphere in horror movies and that's why The Shining, Night of The Living Dead Matango are at the top of my list for the most scariest movies. But Poltergeist may be the only up-and-front scary movie that has gotten to me. I liked this movie. I remember being scared stiff by this one when I was younger. Good stuff.
