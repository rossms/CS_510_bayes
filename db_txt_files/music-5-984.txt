Chris Cornell is one of the most amazing singers i have ever heard. The first time i heard the cd it sent chills up my spine. My favorite song on it is definately When I'm Down . it is so sweet and he sounds sexy in it.I am glad he decided to go solo after Soundgarden broke up. I would recomend this cd to anybody!
