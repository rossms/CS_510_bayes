My 2001 S-type V8 is everything I want in a car. I don't care if the already awesome performance is not quite up to par with that of BMW, b/c the styling more than makes up for it. It's beautiful and elegant, oozes class, and is a champ in the panache department! The interior, while very nice, could use more improvment which is why Jaguar has totally revised it for 2003. Overall, it's an awesome car in every respect.
