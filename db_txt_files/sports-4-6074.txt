He is the point man for the UCLA squad I saw decimate Arizona at Pauley Pavilion on Saturday. While the Bruins were relentlessly crashing the boards, the Arizona defenders would converge on Farmar when he drove to the basket. Needless to say, he made the most of his opportunities to dish off to his teammate for easy buckets. Seems to be competent and shows a good deal of poise for a 20 year old kid.
