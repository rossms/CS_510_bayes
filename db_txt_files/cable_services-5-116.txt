I've had my sirius radio for over a year now. Other than a connection issue which was my fault, not sirius', I've had no problems. I've had 6 of snow on the antenna with no drops. Occationally I'll lose the signal when driving through forests. Very good product. I can't wait to get a second portable unit for the house/other car.
