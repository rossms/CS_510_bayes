Good film, but not one of the best. I think that of James Whale's four horror films, FRANKENSTEIN is the least striking. Of course, Karloff's performance is poignant and of course, it looks like a German expressionistic film, but while it is very good, it does have it's fair share of slip-ups, some forgivable and some not. BRIDE OF FRANKENSTEIN is much better.
