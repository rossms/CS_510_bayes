In the sports page for the NLDS it has St. Louis vs. San Diego, and Houston (Bye). Any team that gets Atlanta gets an easy pass to the NLCS. The Royals would sweep the Braves in the playoffs. And there will be 30,000 people at Turner field to watch the Braves lose 7-1 and 6-0 -- 29,800 will be Astros' fans and 200 Braves fans doing their idiotic Tomahawk Chop. The Braves STINK.
