A good runningback runs. A great runningback also blocks and catches. Walter Payton did all three of those things a well as a runningback ever could, and through in alot more. He could pass (look up his touchdown passes)! He played with heart that has never been matched by anyone else at the position, even Emmitt Smith. He was a leader. Ditka once said he wanted to see an interception just so he could watch Payton block. And don't forget his class, his enthusiasm and his kindness. Just an incredible player and human being. Never quit!
