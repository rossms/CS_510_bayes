I personally haven't ever lived there or seen it, but it's history is rich. It was the start of the hippie movement in the mid-'60s. It was interesting in All in the Family how Archie referred to California as the land of fruits and nuts. All the nuts are a little fruity, and all the fruits are a little nutty. A great state.
