What a forgettable film. As much as I like Will Smith, this movie is Hollywood at its worst. A formulaic plot that was clearly created in about 2 weeks as a blatant effort to cash in on the popularity of Smith and Tommy Lee Jones, as well as the public's craze for all things alien. This is one lousy movie - the special effects were cheap and gawdy, and the script could have been written by a third grader. The only reason that Men in Black doesn't get a 1 is because Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones are good actors - they just can't help it - even when constrained by a moronic plot.
