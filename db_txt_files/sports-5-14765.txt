Tuinei was an undrafted player who started as a defensive tackle. Nate Newton was also undrafted. Nobody ever heard of Larry Allen and Erik Williams coming out of college. Before that there was Kevin Gogan and John Gesek. Not exactly household names. Regarding his toughness, remember the playoff game he won against the Giants AFTER he seperated his shoulder? Got the tough yards when needed. Payton is still the best, but Emmitt's not far behind. Barry Sanders? Check out how many games that he ended up with zero or negative yards.
