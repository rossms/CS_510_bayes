Proof positive that accessibility counts. Everybody likes this recording and they should. It's a very good one. It's solid from beginning to end and achieves a couple moments of true brilliance, but the number one choice as best CD of all time? I wouldn't go that far. Other efforts are just as or nearly as solid and reach more breath taking highs more often. Should definitely be on the list but not in first place. I'm giving it a four mostly because I think this position is inflated. Screwy I know, but there you have it.
