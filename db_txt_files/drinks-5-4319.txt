By far the best single malt if you're into the peaty Islay scotches. In the same comparison category are Ardbeg (nice and peaty but medicinal finish), Bowmore (smoother but not as peaty), and Laphroig (similar to Ardbeg in my opinion). Lagavulin captures the smokey start but combines it with a very smooth finish. Damn tasty!
