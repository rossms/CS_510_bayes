Hmm. Let's see, duke is overrated. well it doesn't take lond to root out the idiots in a group does it. People that say duke is over rated are just grasping for anytthing they can find to cut down the juggernaut that is the Duke Blue Devils. Anyone that says these ludicrous things are clearly either extremely baised or just plain blind. With the player of the year in J.J. and a stellar team how could you make the arrogant assumption that Duke is overrated. Use your intelligence and not your pride. And to bluetarbaby I'm sorry that you think christians are "funny" I'm praying for you and God Bless!
