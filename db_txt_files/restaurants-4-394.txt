Wendy's is as good as fastfood gets. It is consisntly good. All the products seem fresh and most of the stores seem clean and well ran. My biggest complaint is sometimes the fries seem completely unsalted. That isnt really a big deal its just hard to put the salt on them myself because I usually eat them all on the drive home from the resturant. When it comes to fast food it's usually Wendy's or nothing for me.
