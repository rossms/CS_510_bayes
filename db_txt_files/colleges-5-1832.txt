Texas A&M has extremely good faculty in Engineering. It is a pretty happening place. There are students from diverse cultural backgrounds, which helps to know much more than just cramming. I am surprised to see the harsh comments abt. the University. College Station although conservative, but a very peaceful place, perfect for research environment.
