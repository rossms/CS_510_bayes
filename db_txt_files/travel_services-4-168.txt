I've had pretty good luck with Delta. I flew cross-country every four or five weeks for years, and it got to be just as easy as getting on the bus (I still have hundreds of thousands of frequent flyer miles... lacking only the time to take a nice long vacation to use them!) I think Delta was consistently dependable and professional. The food was adequate, nothing special, and the attendants were generally excellent. Flying is more complicated now post 9/11 but I still fly them when I need to.
