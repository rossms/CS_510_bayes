While there is something quaint about a mom and pop book store, for me, what it really comes down to is selection. Barnes and Noble is the biggest of the big - it's stores are more like malls than shops, often with multiple floors and coffeeshops. If you are looking for convenience, Barnes and Noble can't be beat - they will either have, or have almost instant access to, virtually any title every published.
