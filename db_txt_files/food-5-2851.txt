I ve only tried the mushroom soup but it was much better than I expected. A bit on the expensive side as I recall (in the $3 per can neighborhood). I guess you have to pay for the chef s name. But, based on my first good experience with Wolfgang s soups, I would buy it again and take a chance on his other soups as well.
