I enjoy Tom Cruise movies...however, he is very method in the way he acts being the same character in alot of different movies..yet when he departs.. from the smiling pretty boyish roles is when he does his best work...(Think Born on the Fourth of July)Looks wise he is not bad looking he does have something although he is far from the best looking guy in Hollywood...He loses a star for dumping Nicole Kidman...who is awesome
