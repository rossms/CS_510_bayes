This place has beautiful scenery, but the politics can be quite irritating. The Mormon-influenced laws can be irritating and ridiculous, but the demographics are changing and places like Twin Peaks, Gobblers Knob, Capital Reef, and Escalante make it worthwhile. Plus, cost of living is relatively low, traffic moves well, SLC is quite clean, and the airport is only 10-20 minutes from downtown.
