I tell you those commercials that talk down about campbell's soup really irk me. They always taste good, I don't care how old I am, I think at age 38 it's still good. Although I love split pea and bean now, and when I was a kid wouldn't have touched it with a 10 foot pole... unless a spanking was involved....lol
