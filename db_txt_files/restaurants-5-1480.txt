I eat and work for Whataburger. My opinion is not based due to the fact that I work for the company, but it is based on overall experience of knowing I am getting a hot, fresh, and keep in mind, made to order meal served to me. The burgers are bigger, along with the sides, at a good price. Compared to McDonalds, whose beef is not AMERICAN, micro-sized, and dry along with a costly price, Whataburger surpasses them and others.
