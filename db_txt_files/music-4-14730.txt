I'm so very sick of Celine Dion's contribution to this soundtrack . . . but the real talent comes from James Horner, who created a moving mix of classical and Celtic. The infusion of the little taste of Ireland suited the music well, at the same time making the listener feel the romance of being at sea and the drama of the Titanic's sinking. Good soundtrack.
