One of the few authentic old ball parks left, watching a game at Wrigley makes you feel as if you are in the game. There's not a bad seat in the park and Cubby fans treat each game is like its a carnival. Tons of stuff happening inside and outside of the park. Check out the bars nearby after the game they are a blast.
