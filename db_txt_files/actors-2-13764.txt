My daughters love Bynes and I can understand why since they are quite young yet and she consistently plays immature and comedic characters. I cannot imagine how she could receive higher than a 3 simply because she has not done anything to date beyond act silly on All That followed by The Amanda Show on Nick at Night. She has a new series and has done at least one movie but once again neither role has her explore anything even remotely considered acting. I would rate her a deserving 1 except for how much my children like her.
