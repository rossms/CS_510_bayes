A beautiful immersive gaming experience that, IMO, has yet to be equaled. After awhile I seemed to take on the Cloud persona while playing the game. The storyline itself, was Oscar worthy. The visuals (given the times) were extraordinary. The mechanicals, and the user interface were top-notch. Truly one for the ages...
