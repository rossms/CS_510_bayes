A stunning brunette, and a troubled woman in real life, Gene Tierney is best remembered for 'Laura,' 1944, and received her only Oscar nomination for 'Leave Her to Heaven,' 1945. But 'The Ghost and Mrs. Muir,' 1947, is perhaps her best screen performance. Too often cast as socialites and cold beauties, her Lucy Muir is warm and tender and very appealing.
