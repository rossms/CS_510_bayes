He was my favorite character on the NBC soap Passions and seemed like a nice person, even though I never met him in real life. Sadly thats never going to happen since he died in August of this year during heart surgery. What makes it even more sad and sort of weird is that his character Timmy died on the same day as him, but was expected to return in a couple of months. Passions will never be the same without Josh Ryan Evans.
