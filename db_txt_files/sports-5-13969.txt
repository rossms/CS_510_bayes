there is no doubt that Barry Sanders is one of the greatest backs of all time ( if not the greatest). Anyone who thinks otherwise is a fool and only envys his phenominal talent. Noone has the right to critisize his retirement when he has given so many people across the world (I am from Northern Ireland) so much enjoyment in watching him play. If it was not for players like Barry, american football would not be worth watching. Im sad you retired, but thanks for the memories Barry
