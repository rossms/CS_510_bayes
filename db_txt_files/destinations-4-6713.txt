OK people lets set aside conservative politics and the mormons and take into consideration that Utah is one of the most beautiful and scenic states in the country. There is so much varied terrain here from Rocky mountain peaks, world class ski resorts, desert valleys and mesa's. This state is just packed with spectacular scenery all over including some of this country's finest national parks. I realize that Salt Lake City sucks and that there are some backwards people here, but don't dismiss the state of Utah for those reasons.
