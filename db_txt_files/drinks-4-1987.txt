I find this richer than most bottled white tea drinks I've had. I assume that comes from the cane sugar (which is probably unrefined), as that's the only other major ingredient. Still, the taste is rather light and fruity, with no bitterness and a fairly clean finish. Unlike some, this white tea doesn't come across as very watery. In summary, it's light, refreshing, and tasty. With 1/8th the caffeine of coffee, it has 70 calories per 16 oz bottle.
