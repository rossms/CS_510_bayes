The Jumpstart Series is so good mainly because it covers ALL of the age groups K-6th grade. It very well is a fun and interesting way to help your child learn to read, count, do math, spell correctly, and many other topics that can be found on this software. The price may be high, but it's a lot cheaper then having to pay for your child's college education.
