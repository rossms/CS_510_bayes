Cleveland was my team for the longest time and I still love them they have never gotten what they work their entire lives for and I feel bad for them I hate the Yankees and when they made the deal to trade David Justice to the Yanks so that they would have more money for Manny. Look where it got you, now you have not Manny and no Justice plus Sandy is gone and Richie. Keep on working hard Cleveland I still believe that you have it in you somewhere. You still have the best lead-off man in baseball in Loften and the beat double play duo Visquel and Robbie.
