Once again, a QT has resurrected long lost songs for effective usage in his movie. (See and hear Strawberry Letter 23 in Jackie Brown, Coconut and Hooked on a Feeling in Reservoir Dogs, and Jungle Boogie in Pulp Fiction)> Santa Esmerelda's Don't Let Me Be Misunderstood was a minor hit here in the late '70s, a song I completely forgot about. Until seeing this movie. That song alone makes this CD worth getting (it's the ten minute plus extended mix). The rest of the album is fair to good, with the usual snippets of dialogue from his film.
