This tea really grew on me, after a few bottles. Maple syrup offsets the black tea's bitterness - the balance of which gives it a slight kick. I have difficulty really calling that a downside, but I think it might turn some people off. The main reason I gave it a 5-star rating is that it's got a subtly rich and complex flavor that is equally compatible with a thirst-quenching chug and a slow, appreciative sip. It goes well with desserts, too!
