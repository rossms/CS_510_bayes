The second star is for the effort in born on the fourth of July and for the fact that he seems like a decent guy. What is he generally doing in serious movies? I have no idea.I think that you either have acting abilities or you don't, you can't TRY to achieve them. Cruise has tried and did pretty bad.1 more thing: The scene in Top Gun when Tom Skeritt and Cruise discuss philosophy about flying is dreadful.Shame on all, director and actors,i nearly vomited.
