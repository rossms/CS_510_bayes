I didn't like the actual sitting down and watching this movie.. it was too long of a movie for so little blood pumping action, but after watching it, you realize that tom hanks really did a great job of putting you in the mind of man so lonely he wanted to commit suicide and became friends with a volleyball. this movie gets you thinking, and any movie that does that, especially in this day and age, is a very good movie. I do take 1 point away because like I said, to actually sit and watch this for the length of time it was, is just a bit too long. A lot of classic moments in this movie also.
