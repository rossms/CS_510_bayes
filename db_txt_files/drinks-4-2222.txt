A caffeine-free, fruity beverage with a delightfully mellow taste! I'm not a big fan of berry drinks, but this is definitely one I like! While it's actually a fruit infusion (or tisane), it has a subtle richness to its flavor that's very tea-like. Its ingredients include hibiscus, blackberry leaves, blueberries, and raspberries. Sweetened with cane sugar, it contains only 50 calories per 16 oz bottle.
