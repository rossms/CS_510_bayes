The Vice President must concede the election to George Bush and put the US of A first. I do not wish to see this great country go through any more turmoil. Bush won Florida. I know that and most of us know it. The criteria for hand counts does not exist. There was no fraud and no system breakdown. Thats it! NO MORE PLEASE....
