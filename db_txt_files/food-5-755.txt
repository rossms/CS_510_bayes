I started a new diet and included in this diet plan was plain oatmeal. I am not fond of the plain taste so I added fresh bananas and fresh peach slices to it. I eat at my desk while working every morning and feel more awake and energetic then when I skipped breakfast and had coffee. Including oatmeal in my diet has helped me to lose 5lbs in one week (along with other healthy finds and mild exercise--yeah, I'm lazy.)
