I don't know about later models of the Sephia,but I bought my 97 Sephia LS new for THOUSANDS of DOLLARS less than comparably equipped econo-boxes.This model sephia is practically a clone of the Mazda Protege.Since it uses the Mazda drive chain and other Mazda components it has proven to be a reliable vehicle worth the very modest price that was paid for it.
