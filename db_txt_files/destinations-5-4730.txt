I don't live in Detroit, but I go there whenever I can. I think the city is way underrated. No one can deny that Detroit is a colorful, historic city with a raw character that proclaims it the King of the Rust Belt. I don't appreciate people dissing this city just because they can't cut it here. Detroit doesn't want you anyway. Motown, the Motor City, the Big-D. Detroit has style and soul.
