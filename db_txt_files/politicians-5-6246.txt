I think Janet had an extremely tedious job working under Clinton...she did very well given all the terrible problems that confronted her. I would like to see alot of America in her spot. She's strong and smart...We need more people like Janet in important government positions. She's fair brave.She did a great job. Some of our weak in integrity society can't see that. Saturday Night Live was fun Sat. night...she has a great sense of humor as well as being a great politician. You go Janet!
