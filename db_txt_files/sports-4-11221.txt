Lloyd Carr is like Canada: he's a solid, consistent football coach whose teams rarely have spectacular seasons, but never have bad seasons. He gets a lot of criticism from Michigan fans; the vast majority is unfair, but some of it is fair. Given that he's won a national championship, a few Big Ten titles, and has a good record against our rivals (OSU, ND, MSU), I would say that he's done a good job.
