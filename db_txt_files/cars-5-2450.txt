I fell in LOVE with this car when I first saw it. 227HP (in 2003 it will have 240) AWD Rally-Inspired Turbo.....0-60 in 5.4. Plus Subaru is tweaking and improving it every year.....if I had the $40 000 (thats how much it costs in Canada) I would buy it RIGHT NOW and take it to the track to SMOKE those Civics!
