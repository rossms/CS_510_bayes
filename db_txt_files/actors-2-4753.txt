I just don't GET this guy. He's not especially talented, and he's only considered good-looking because he's Irish. I guarantee if he were American most people wouldn't give him a dime on the street, which is where he'd presumably be living. I mean, he's above average in looks, but there are tons of actors out there who are handsomer. American women are just suckers for a roguish Irish lad, I suppose.
