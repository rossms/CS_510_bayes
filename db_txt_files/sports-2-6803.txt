Wow!! It might be too early to judge Stan Van Gundy, but his first performance as Heat coach was bad. Poorly placed time-outs? Massive injuries? Maybe the augries for his leadership are going to be pretty bad. His only experience as head coach was one season with the University of Wisconsin and he's not remembered there as a winning coach. He seemed like a frustrated little man in last nights game.
