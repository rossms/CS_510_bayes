I have yet to see the film in its entirety, but what i have seen convinces me that it's not about propaganda or blame, or any such crap. It's about the last little bit of Jesus' earthly life and His death upon the cross. One thing that convinces me that it's not propaganda to slight Jews or other such nonsense is that Mel Gibson wielded the hammer. That speaks to the basic truth that Jesus died on the cross for our sins, and that each of us are responsible for a hammer blow upon the nails.
