I used to LOVE Ambercrombie when I was in High School! I mean LOVE LOVE LOVE. But that's been a few years ago, and I guess my problem is that everything is so small. I used to wear a size 6 or 8 there and even though I did not get bigger, the new clothes kept getting smaller. And their T-shirts are outrageoulsly small. Also, the material is getting really cheap. Their T-shirts are so flimsy and thin, you might as well wear tissue paper with Abercrombie written all over it. The prices never seemed to bad back then because the quality was good, but forget it! Not what it used to be!!
