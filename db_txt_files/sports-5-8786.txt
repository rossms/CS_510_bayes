STEVE FRANCIS HAS BEEN MY HERO SINCE HE ENTER THE NBA. I LOVE HIS ATTUIDE IT'S NOT COCKEY IT'S SETTLE. WHEN I SEEN HIM GO VISIT HIS SISTER DURING THE ALL STAR BREAK I HAD TO STOP MYSELF FROM CRYING. I KNOW I'M NOT HIS ONLY FAN I'M SURE ALOT OF OTHER PEOPLE WOULD LIKE TO SEE MORE ON STEVE HE IS GOING TO ONE OF THE YOUNGER PLAYERS THAT GOING DOWN IN HISTORY.
