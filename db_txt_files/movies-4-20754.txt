A very different kind of musical. A young couple end up at a very strange mansion. this is kind of a musical for Halloween. TIm Curry plays Frankenfurter. an odd transvestite who welcome the young couple to stay the night. Susan Sarandon is in the movie as Janet. some good songs are in this like the Time Warp. Very strange plot.but if someone is looking for a differnt kind of musical to watch this is it.
