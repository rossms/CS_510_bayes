to me a 4.5. A Jerry Maguire is a sports agent who is at the top of his profesion when he starts to question his ethics. he writes a report about it which gets him applause but it backfires when he can no longer get athletes to represent.He finally gets an athlete with Cuba Goodings character and tries to put his new ethics to work aobut caring about the athletes feelings and well being. he also meets a future wife and her son. A pretty good movie with good acting.
