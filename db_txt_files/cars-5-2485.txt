Now for all you none beleivers who dont think that a supra can go about 180 stock, heres what ya do. find a person with a stock TT. now pull the traction control fuse. this is what controls the speed limiter. now take it and see how fast it will go. and ya didnt even have to speed a few 100 on a chip.
