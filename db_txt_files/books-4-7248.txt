This was a very good book, but also a very difficult read that requires a lot of concentration. If you like the role of the ubiquitous drug "soma" in Brave New World you will probably like the much stranger drugs Can-D and Chew-Z in this novel. However, where B.N.W. is more concerned with social systems and government, Palmer Eldritch is more about spirituality, escapism and things ethereal.
