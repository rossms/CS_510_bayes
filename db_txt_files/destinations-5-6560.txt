Texas is an extremly great, large state that really has imrpoved over the years. I lived there from 1998-1999. It was extremmly fun living there. The temperature which always sounds hot, isn't all that hot, it is in fact a very comfortable state to live in. Downtown Dallas looks beautiful at night, and the lights are extremly pretty. It's no NYC, but it's the closet to it.
