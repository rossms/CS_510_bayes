Amazing! 15 years ago, I would've given Pepsi 5 stars but now, that I'm 30, I find Pepsi annoyingly too sweet. I'm burned out of that taste. Plus, I'm sick of those nagging Britney Spears commercials and I dind it pathetic that they considered Ludacris as another endorser and all he sings about is gangs and defames women, a very poor excuse for a role model.
