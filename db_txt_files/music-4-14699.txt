if you like oldie but goodie music from the 50s and 60s, there are some good songs on here. I bought the record album years ago when the movie came out. It has lots of songs on it with the original groups singing on it.sometimes Wolfman Jack is introducing the songs which is okay i guess.but sometimes annoying when it cuts into the song too much. Af pretty good collection if someone likes this kind of music.
