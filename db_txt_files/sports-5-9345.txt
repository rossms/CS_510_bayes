Rob has been turning the tide on plenty of games during the final seconds since he was back in Houston in the early nineties. He helped bring Hakeem's Rockets to two championships and saved the Lakers last year against the Kings. The whole lakers team was worn out from three championship runs and their performance suffered...Rob was no exception...their loss this year was a team loss. It doesn't take away anything from Horry's many previous accomplishments. I hope the Lakers decide to have him back for another run next year...that would be wise.
