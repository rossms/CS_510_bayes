I got my CD player two months ago. At first, I thought that a CD player with a circular shape would be uncomfortable to use. But, now I change my mind, the circular shape helps to hold the CD player better. What I like the best is that during my work out, I can hear my CD's without interruption and I love it. I usually use my CD player when I'm on a step-machines or when I go running, so I have a lot of movement. In past experiences, I had other CD players that usually would skip the songs constantly during my work out. Sony is good to stay at least with me.
