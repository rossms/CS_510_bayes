What the heck is all the rave about Krispy Kreme? Dunkin Donuts has always been the best! Great coffee, and their donuts are not greasy, always taste fresh and all their other stuff is great too! Munchkins are awesome for the car ride! Living on the West coast now, can't find a Dunkin Donuts anywhere, but always visit when I am back East! Best!!
