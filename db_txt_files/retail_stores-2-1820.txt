I think they have a good selection of stuff and the prices aren't too bad. I'd probably like Wal-Mart better if they would stop forcing themselves into small towns and destroying farmland and parks. Wal-Mart still beats K-Mart though. If that store was listed here, I would give it one star. The local K-Mart is horrible!
