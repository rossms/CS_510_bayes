I enjoy Whataburger. There are few that remain in my area and none by my house. When I am in a part of town that has one and I need to eat I often choose to eat here. The breakfast menu is greatly improved but I rarely eat there for breakfast so I can't say if that is worth it or not. The burgers are good enough to get when I can.
