I've been drinking vodka for many years and in 1994 I discovered Chopin vodka while returning from Poland. It was sold on the LOT plane for $8 per .50 liter bottle. Upon returning home I compared it to Absolut, which at the time was the hot vodka on the market. Chopin was smoother and I've been comparing Chopin to other vodkas since then. It tastes better to me than anything, Grey Goose, Belverede, Ketel One, you name it.
