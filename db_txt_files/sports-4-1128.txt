Welcome to Fenway, Gary. Do you think it's time for the Red Sox and their fans to begin acting like World Champions instead of perennially frustrated losers? That section of right field, with the low fence and the fans right on the field, probably has to go now. Where is the outrage on the part of the Red Sox players against this fan who obviously interfered with a player in the act of playing their hallowed game? It proves that you can be world champions and still have the heart of a loser.
