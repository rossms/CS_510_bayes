First off I call myself a Republican, but I vote for Democrats every election as well. I would have given Bill 3 or 4 stars, but there's the whole issue of Monica. I don't care what his extra marital situation was once he got out of office. However, he was Commander and Chief of the Armed Services. In the military, adultery leads to court marshall. It's a wonder that the troops didn't respect him like they do George now. Why is it one set of laws for the Commander and another for his soldiers?
