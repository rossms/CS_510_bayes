I remember way back when Leiter was traded by the Yankees to the Blues Jays for Jessie Barfield. Due to injuries and the idiotic state of the Yankee organization, he had never gotten a full chance. Well, he has certainly made up for lost time. He is the ace of the Mets staff, won a World Series ring with the Marlins, and is one of the top lefties in baseball. And, to top it off, he is an engaging personality who seems to be a good guy.
