What I like about Christina is that shes a very brave and intelligent actress that seems to have a lot of common sense and a good eye for good roles and movies. Shes one of those actresses that isn't afraid to occasionally play white trailer trash. Some actresses would actually find these roles offensive, but not Christina. I like her personality as well as she doesn't imitate she innovates and thats what makes her stand out from the rest.
