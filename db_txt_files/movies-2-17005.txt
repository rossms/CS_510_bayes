Very boring movie. I did not care about the characters. I was glad to see it end. I even read during some of this movie. Kate Hudson comes to France to visit her sister who is expecting another baby to find the husband is leaving her sister. A bunch of other boring things happen. a dumb plot that trudged along. I am glad I only rented this movie.
