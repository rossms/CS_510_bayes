I just love the lady in the plastic cap. We call her baghead around here.I hope she becomes as famous as that Pinesol Lady Dianne. I am still waiting for the Reynolds Wrap girls Pat & Betty to do a new commercial. They got to tell us what the name of the Honey Bunch Of Oats Lady is. She looks like a Gladys or Wanda. She is such a character and everytime she comes on TV we all look to see and hear her hardy laugh.
