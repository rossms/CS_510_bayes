This film was pretty good. It really had a great lesson with the theme that one person can change the world, but it was a little far fetched. However, I liked the quote- Some people are just so used to things the way they are... even if they are bad. This film had a great beginning and a sad, but great end, but the middle dragged on at some points. Good performances by Kevin Spacey, Helen Hunt and Haley Joel Osment.
