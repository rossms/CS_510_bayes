Home of the US Space Rocket Center and much more, Alabama is a great state! It has alot of good tourist attractions, barring the boring nature ones, of course. It also has a bunch of good businesses, and is home to numerous stores including Wal-Mart, Chick-Fil-A and more! The crime rate will eventually decrease, of course. Overall, I like my home state pretty well. As for the South rising again, let's just say, I'm not a big fan of the Confederacy...:)
