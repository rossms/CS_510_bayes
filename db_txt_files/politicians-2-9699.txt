Got us completely involved in the Vietnam Idiot War. That automatically takes off points. Eisenhower and Kennedy sorta started it, but Johnson finished! Plus, I don't like his politics either. We didn't have to go to the Vietnam War...as a result of his stupidity, a whole lotta people got unnecesarrily killed. Thus, since the war of 1812 was Mr. Madison's War and WWII was Mr. Roosevelt's War and the war on terrorism is Mr. Bush's War , 'Nam will be Mr. Johnson's War . Alright, he did a few good things...that's why I gave him a 2, not a 1. Mr. Johnson was just a bad president. Take care, everyone!
