The blues samples are extremely well chosen and Moby just lets them do their work. thus, the result is a quality experience. The art of using samples is in their choice and complimenting this with a sympathetic backing. He does this extremely well. however, some of the other tracks are just really bad with no interest what so-ever. So overall, 4 stars is about right, still worth buying for the blues tracks. Anybody know where I can buy the original blues recordings?
