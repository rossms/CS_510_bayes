Prompted to see the movie because of the book, which I really liked, I was somewhat disappointed. Although Matt Damon did a terrific job and the scenary was awe inspiring, the tensions that made the book, were not built up enough in the movie, e.g. the passion of the love affair, on which the movie was really based, did not really engage me.
