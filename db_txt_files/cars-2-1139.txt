This car does NOT rock. About the only thing you get is a reliable car, period. The most boring interior I've ever seen. And to the college kid whose dad bought him one, you should get the facts straight, the Tiburon fx comes with a 160hp engine and I could name millions of things more exciting about it. So enjoy THAT with a stick.
