Shrill one issue mouthpiece who leaves no room for honest dissent. Useless as legislator. Maintains powerbase by stirring racial fears. She and her ilk are worse than avowed white supremacists. At least latter are easy to see as idiots. Waters Co. hide behind being black. Every dissenting opinion cast in ugly light of racism. Honest, hard working blacks (who are in the great majority) would be better off without this type of hyperbole generating media monger.
