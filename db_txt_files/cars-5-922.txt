I have a '99 Regal GS. Disagree with other commenter. Does NOT need premium. That is manufacturer hype. Runs fine on regular, never pings. Fastest car I've ever had. Can be rolling 10mph, punch it and still smoke the tires. Very comfortable leather interior, monster Monsoon 200w stereo system. Sucks gas pretty bad when you 'drive' it hard. Only downside. That's why I drive my 4-banger pickup to work every day and save the car for special around town trips.
