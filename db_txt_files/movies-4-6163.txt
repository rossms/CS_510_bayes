One of my favorite Stanwyck movies hands down. This film grapples the harsh reality of the social classes. Sacrifice for the happiness of another, is always the most heroic feat to watch, and Stella Dallas show us this in full form. A heartbreaking story, but a testemant to the power of Love. A delightful film, one in which I highly recommend.
