This movie was a great disappointment to me. Although I thought the characterization, acting, and special effects were admirable, there were several inconsistencies with the book. Idle readers may enjoy it, but die-hard Potterists like myself would do well to avoid it. There is very little adherance to detail, and one important part needed for the audience to figure out a detail is completely omitted. They also discluded characters entirely, such as Peeves the Poltergeist, or gave them miniscule parts, like Fred and George Weasley. In short, the movie is certainly less than spellbinding.
