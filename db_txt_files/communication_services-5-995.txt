Motorola's PageWriter uses this system. PageWriter is totally cool -- allows you to send and receive email through your pager. Since it uses a satellite network, it's available just about anywhere -- way, way better coverage than a cell phone. Pager is kind of heavy, but given what it does, it's still very impressive. Why spend thousands on an Iridium phone when this is available?
