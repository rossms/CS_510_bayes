He can hit,he fields pretty good but that is as far as it goes. For a guy that has so much going on the field he is a jerk with the fans.The day after the season was over the fans and the city had a day at Pac Bell Park to Honor the Giants for a great season. Barry didn't even have the courtesy to show show up. He forgets where the money comes from to pay his big salary.The fans matter. Yeah the Giants may be the home team but I rooted for Anaheim in the series just so that Barry wouldn't get that ring.That may be bad but it no worse than Bond's attitude.
