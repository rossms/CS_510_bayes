What a ridiculous display by the vast majority of people on O.J. This site is supposed to rate him - and everyone else - as a football player not for you people to launch into a diatribe about his personal life. Sticking to the subject at hand: O.J. Simpson was a great football player. Perhaps in the top five running backs of all-time. By the way, keep your ugly and unsolicited opinions about his personal life to yourselves!
