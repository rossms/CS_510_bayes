A fun Movie to watch. It doesn't seem real complete, but it is complete enough for a horror flick I suppose. I liked the Jason and Freddy fighting scenes, I didn't care for the teenagers hanging out, it seemed like another teen movie type, and the dude dressed up like Jay from Jay and Silent Bob was a cheap rip off. Overall this is a good movie.
