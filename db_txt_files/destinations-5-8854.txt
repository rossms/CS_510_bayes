Skoal is like putting a pillow in your mouth; Copenhagen is like putting a million ants in your mouth. Kodiak is the only dip that stays put and feels good. It also tastes the best, has the longest flavor, and lasts longer than all the rest (especially notoriously short-lived skoal). Kodiak is the best dip on the market and has had my loyalty for fifteen years.
