Best passer, free throw shooter, and among the best three point shooters in the NBA. The reigning MVP and he's having a better year this year than when he won it last year. Looks like he'll have a bookend for that trophy shelf. I've never seen Steve Nash play in a game when he wasn't the best player on the court. He's the "Larry Bird" from the great white north.
