good movie based on a real life Horse. I love these underdog movies. Seabiscuit was a small horse who had some bad homes until he ended up in one with a kind trainer and owner. Red Pollard was also kind of an underdog, he was left at a ranch by his parents, blinded in one eye. but both the horse and young man went on to be championship horse and jockey racers. good actors in the film. A bit too long started out kind of slow. good move otherwise.
