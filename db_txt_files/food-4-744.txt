I love the corn falky goodness! Its a classicx cereal that is the best. If therte is not mini-wheats at my house I get a bowl of corn flakes and put mostly flakes and just a little tad nit of milk cause they get soggy to quick and that is my only companint. I like the taste with alot of sugar and It is a good start to a good day.
