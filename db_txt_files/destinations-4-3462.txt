Great bars and clubs, and more college students per mile than anywhere else in the country. Girls are well dressed and many hotties. My knock on the city is that since it's not on a grid system like New York it's easy to get lost. Also the Big Dig is taking waay too long and the construction is a mess. Go Red Sox and Celtics!
