I think that XP is the almost best operating system around. The best one I've ever used is Guardian, which is on a mainframe computer (Original name Tandems, then bought by Compaq, now merged with HP). Since its not PC based, I have to settle for XP. I've used Linux/Unix based systems, and I completely think they stink!
