I am totally disappointed in the recall of crispy glazed carmel & kettle popcorn. I bought two boxes and did not experience any difficulty in popping either. I returned to Wal-Mart to purchase more and found out that it was no longer available. I would love to see these products back on the shelves of supermarkets.
