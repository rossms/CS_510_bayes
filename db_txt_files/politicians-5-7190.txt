Jesse jackson is a great individual.He registered blacks during the peroid of intergration in the south, he helped get pows out of war torn countries.As I read these comments I am so saddened by all the hate in people, especially towards Blacks.A lot of Republicans claim to be christians. Would Jesus leave such hateful statements.NO He would be ashamed at people who did.Those who have not sinned throw the first stone.
