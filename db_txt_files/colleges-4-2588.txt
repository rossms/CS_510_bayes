Academically, this has always been a good school, albeit overrated. Lewisburg is fairly depressing, but not any more than most places in the U.S. that are in the backwater. Besides which, when you're an undergraduate you should be campus-oriented, thus, the town shouldn't be a high priority on your list of interests. College students tend to forget that they're in school to get an education, to study, to learn. Chugging beer, smoking bongs and boffing co-eds is a sideline to it all that too many youngsters don't seem to get. That's why so many flunk out or graduate with 2.01 GPAs.
