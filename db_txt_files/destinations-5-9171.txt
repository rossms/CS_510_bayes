Always been one of my favorite buildings in Auckland, New Zealand. The displays inside the building are fascinating, and extemely interesting, and educational. Recently I visited the Museum for the first time in over 15 years, and found a great improvement! The store is excellent, the live displays of Maori Culture are wonderful! I also saw a very interesting display of the Wine Industry in Auckland. I grew up in the Winemaking and vineyard area of Auckland, and it brought back many happy memories! The museum is now even better!
