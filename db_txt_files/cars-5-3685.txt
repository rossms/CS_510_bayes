I see where one says it didn't stand up to her/his expectations when rented for a long trip. Did you ever think that one was already run to death from being rented people going nuts driving it?? Another says the gas mileage isn't what they wanted. Well...why didn't you buy a smaller vehicle?? Also, it helps to keep them up (tune-up, etc.). The other one is upset because they didn't make it JUST for them. If you don't like it, don't buy it. I have an 93 Chevy Blazer SE /S10 w/ the Tahoe package 4WD. It's SO Comfy I feel safe in it. It's gotten me out of some jams tows my 2-Horse trailer nicely.
