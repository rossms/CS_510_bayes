We have a new 2003 Audi allroad quattro. This is an amazing car with do-anything capability, supreme comfort, beautiful styling, and carefully thought-out features. Too early to determine absolute reliability as of yet, but our 1999 A6 Avant has been trouble-free at 60,000 miles. We love them both!! Highly recommended!!
