Matt Damon pulled off the action-hero role quite nicely. It almost made me forget completely about his turn as the creepy psycho in Talented Mr. Ripley . Overall, Bourne Identity was very entertaining, had some cool action and hand-to-hand combat sequences and also had a great car chase scene. The romance was a little goofy but I guess they had to throw that in to appeal to everyone. I would like to see more of Matt Damon in action - type roles. He's a great actor, and it's fun to watch him use his body as well as his brains.
