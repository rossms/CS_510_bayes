This is a good game for kids because in a way it helps build their preliminary math skills. It is also good because it teaches kids a lesson that they are able to use in life, which is sometimes you get a break(a ladder) and are able to move up in the game , and sometimes you hit a rough part(the chute) and have to start all over again, but either way you finish.
