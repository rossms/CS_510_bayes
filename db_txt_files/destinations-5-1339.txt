The Alpine countries of Switzerland and Austria are my favourites of all. Glorious mountain scenery, fresh air, exhilirating ski-ing, efficient, clean and pretty cities (in the main) Would move here in an instant. The people are orderly and have a certain gravitas but I'd rather have this than the chaotic shambles that Britain has become.
