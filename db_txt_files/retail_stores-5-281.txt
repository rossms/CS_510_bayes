Being a crossdresser, I can honestly say that VS has hands down made people like me feel more at home than any other chain store. The sales people are friendly and helpful and don't stare and whisper behind your back. Their panties and bras are by far the best quality you can buy and I don't mind spending the little extra for that. I wish they carried some sexier items in larger sizes. I really don't know too many women over 30 that could fit into most of the items in the stores! I jsut wish they would back off with the pushing of a VS charge card, it gets annoying.
