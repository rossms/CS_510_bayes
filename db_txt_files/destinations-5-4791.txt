I love Rio, had a blast there, spectacular scenery,exciting night life,beautiful beach, would go again in a heartbeat if i had the chance. But Igor500's comments, everyone gets along? black & white, rich and poor? Seems to me Rio has one of the highest crime rates in the world. I would not feel safe walking around alone at night, but that is the case in many American cities as well. Unfortunate result of poverty in our world today.
