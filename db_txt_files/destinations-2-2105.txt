Cuban revolution a roaring success? Come on, you must be out of your mind. Try to explain that to millions of cubans living in the island, (one of them my father and half of my family) in total poverty and struggling to live like a human being. I hate when ignorant people talk about Cuba without knowing the true situation under Fidel Castro's dictatorial government.
