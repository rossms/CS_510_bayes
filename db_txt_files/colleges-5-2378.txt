This is a beautiful place!Everybody says hello when passing by.Happy faces tell alot.For a small school,2100 students it has great facilities.They are preparing to spend 60 million on new buildings and landscaping.They cracked the U.S.News top 50 this year and appear to be very much an up and coming MID-WEST academic and athletic powerhouse.Their girls swim team recently won the National D-III Championship.The more I investigate this place the more positives I see.
