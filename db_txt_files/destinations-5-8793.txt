How can you get any better than the strongest stuff available in a can?! I grew up on a farm so I think I've had a can of Cope in my pocket for about 15 yrs. Gotta give it up to something that doesn't really have any comparisons(or equals). I have prevented more than a few buddies from deciding to ever chew by giving them a dip(or two) of Cope. But all in all this truely a realman's chew.
