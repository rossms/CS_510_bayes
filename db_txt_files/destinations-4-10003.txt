I am not a very big smoker, but when I do smoke, Marlboro Menthols are what I go for. Lights are also good, but they do not have that same punch when you inhale and are not as refreshing when you exhale. In my opinion, as with most menthols, these cigarrettes really don't smell good at all, they will totally stink up your car, but its still worth it. As for the fiberglass, I don't buy into that rumor, but menthols will cause you to bleed if smoked too often. All things in moderation. Much better than Newports, and where I live, alot cheaper. My favs.
