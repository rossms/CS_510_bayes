About ten years ago, I spent two weeks in Metairie, just outside of New Orleans. I remember several things about the trip. One, you can go for miles and miles without seeing a whole lot of anything. Two, New Orleans has the most backward, confusing, mess of a highway system that I've ever seen. Three, I never had a bad meal the whole time I was there, and we ate at quite a few different places. Four, with the exception of the food and the French Quarter, it's really not that different from any other big city. In other words, a nice place to visit, but living there would be a different story.
