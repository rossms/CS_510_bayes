As good as it was, it was the worst of the four movies so far. Due to time constraints, they left important plot lines out of play, and left a few charactors hanging that should have been better explored. I owuld rather have it released like KILL BILL in two volumes. The plot lines they left out could adversely effect the upcoming films, especially if you are not familair with the books. It was good. Not great, but good.
