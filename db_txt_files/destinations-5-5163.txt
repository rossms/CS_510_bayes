Beautiful, always sunny, scenic, awesome. I lived on the Western Slope in Grand Junction for my first 12 years of life, and have lived in Denver the past 8. Two different perspectives of a very beautiful, diverse state. Could do without Commerce City's smog, but hardly worth taking away a star. While most places winters consist of a small amount of snow stuck to the ground for months, it'll snow 8 inches overnight in Denver and melt away with a following week of 50+ degree temperatures. I LOVE IT! I don't care how cold it is with the sun beating down, I wouldn't take it any other way.
