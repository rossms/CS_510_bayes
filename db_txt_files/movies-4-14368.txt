If this movie had continued for another 10 minutes, I would have had to walk out. It was so uncomfortable, so disturbing, so relentless, that it was really almost too much to handle. I recommend this movie only if you are not easily shocked by things - if you can get past the brutal, graphic, hopeless story line, you will find some excellent acting, and a beautifully directed film. Ellen Burstyn is outstanding as the aging, tolerant mom, turned diet pill addict. I do not recommend it as a first date movie.
