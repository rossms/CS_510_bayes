Certainly a racist but that came with the time and place he grew up in. Okay so he shot a 67 at Augusta. He also was hammered by 12 year old Bob Rosburg in the club championship at the Olympic Club. The club members taunted him mercilessly and he dissapeared for two years. Only four stars for being a baby.
