I'm on a feta cheese kick lately, and I find that it tastes good on almost anything. I add it to salads, pasta dishes, pizza, and even Mexican food. I love its salty taste and interesting texture. A little feta goes a long way, too, which is nice if you're watching your fat intake. I've experimented with the flavored fetas out there, and they're pretty tasty. Any way you eat it, feta is scrumptious!
