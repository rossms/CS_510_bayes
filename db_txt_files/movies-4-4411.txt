Cute. The story takes up where the first movie leaves off--after the wedding of Shrek and Fiona, newlywed ogres. And, of course, it's time to meet the in-laws. Starring the familiar cast of the original Shrek, there are a few newcomers that are welcome (Antonio Banderas as Puss in Boots was pretty entertaining). Cute humor, mostly family-friendly, worth watching overall.
