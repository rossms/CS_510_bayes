Laura Lippman is one of my favorite authors and I feel that this book deserves a much higher rating. Her protagonist is a strong-willed female who has a knack for getting into trouble, and the plots are entertaining and humorous. Her first novel, Baltimore Blues, is a good place to start her series featuring Tess Monaghan.
