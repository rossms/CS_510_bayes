Triscuits are excellent crackers, especially when you want to add a topping. They have a rich, nutty flavor which stands alone very nicely, and they complement nearly any type of dip or spread . Some crackers break easily when dipped, but not Triscuits. You can even spread cold cream cheese on them without disastrous consequences. When I'm looking for a delicious, hearty (and hardy) cracker (especially for entertaining), I go with Triscuits.
