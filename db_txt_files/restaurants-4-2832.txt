For fast-food Mexican, Taco Cabana is just about the best there is. Better by far than Taco Bell or Del Taco, the food quality is fresher and, in most locations, you can enjoy a beer with your meal. The tacos, enchiladas and taquitos are very good, but the nachos leave a little to be desired. Wish they were nationwide; most of the locations I've seen are in Texas and Florida.
