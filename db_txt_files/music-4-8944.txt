beautiful song with an equally beatiful and artistic video. This song carries a great and very positive message, much more positive than any Limp Bizkit or Papa Roach song. The video is rather stale although lovely. Alot of standing around. Not alot to it. I love the use of the camera and lighting though. Those two elemrnt mixed with a great song perfomed by an amazing band makes for a good video.
