I gave it a 4 because it was kind of challenging for me to learn, but once you do, it's the funnest. I personally only play videogames on certain occasions and rarely like them, but this one is one I myself will buy for my PlayStation. The only reason it didn't get a five was because I felt this is a hard game to learn if you hardly ever play videogames.
