A good soldier, but not a great one; could not have been victorious w/o the French. A good farmer, but not a great one; always in debt. A great explorer, although not well known for that. A good president, but lacking the intellect of Franklin or Jefferson to be their peer. His greatest strength, however, was an unswerving moral compass. Accutely aware that each act as President set a precedent, and wanting to act responsibly in all manners. Take note, Clinton(s) and Gore. You'll never be in this man's company. We are a blessed country to have had him as a patriot when we needed him.
