Who doesn't root for this guy? Unlike the flashier pitchers who throw the heat and seem focused on racking up Ks (Kerry Wood comes to mind), Maddux will do whatever he can to get batters out (groundouts are his bread & butter). He never had an over-powering arm but his age is forcing him to rely more than ever on placement, and I think he's good for 12-14 more wins this year (2004).
