I'm sorry, but I just don't care to eat a plate of greasy mess that all tastes the same because it was cooked with the meal of the guy sitting behind me and then serveed to me by a toothless wreck of a woman. How these places stay in business is beyond me. Sure it's open 24 hours but it's not the only place like that. Drive down to IHOP or Huddle House instead.
