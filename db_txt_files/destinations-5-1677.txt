Wish I could say I have been here before, but my brother married a Thai girl and she is the sweetest person I have ever met, not to mention she can cook such yummy stuff. She likes things extra spicy. Even if you think it's unbearable she thinks its eh If the rest of the people from the country are like her, it's got to be an awesome country.
