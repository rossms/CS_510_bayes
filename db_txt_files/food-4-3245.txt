The pizza and the chicken parm. is the best. Of course, it helped that I cut all carbs and sugar out of my diet for two months before I started eating Lean Cuisine. My taste have changed completely. When I drink a diet soda, I swear it regular soda becuase my body forgets what real sugar taste like. Same thing goes for Lean Cuisine, my body is so not used to high calorie, fatty food that it thinks Lean Cuisine is enduldging. I lost 25 lbs. and I am sure that Lean Cuisine will help keep it off.
