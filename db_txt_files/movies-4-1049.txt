this is a very different movie. Guess what some would call odd or quirky, I was surprised to find i actually liked this movie. Frances McDormand is great as the pregnant sherriff trying to kind out what happened in some murders in her area. William H. Macy is really good as the swindling husband car dealer who made arrangements to have his wife kidnapped for the ransom and got more than what he bargained for. He hires two slimey people to kidnap her and they end up murdering people. This is a strange movie so a lot of people may not like it.but it is well acted, and at least not precictable.
