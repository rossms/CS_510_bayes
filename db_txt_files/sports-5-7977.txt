Iverson is a great player. He's fun to watch, he plays his heart out and he's enomously talented. He wears his heart on his sleeve and has more heart and guts than most other people do. He is tough and he's keepin' it real. People dont get him because he's from a generation and social class most NBA fans cannot relate to. He does have his flaws, but he's maturing and he's really not much worse than other Pro athletes these days.
