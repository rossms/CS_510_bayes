dear player's. My comment is that I love to smoke Dear Player's I have a problem!I bought a package of you 20 player's light and 8 of the 20 smokes came apart at the filter.For $10.00 a Package I would think that would be made a lot better.Unfortunately we bought them in a town that was not our own,therefore were unable to return them.We then had to go to the store and by papers to fix the ones that came apart.Thank you Terrye Chellew.
