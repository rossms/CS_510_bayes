Ok, so its clear that everyone that has a negative opinion about WinCo works for a union or wants a special experience when going grocery shopping. I personally am on a tight budget and want a good deal without the hassle. I walk in with a list in hand and am grateful that there is a place in town where I don't feel taken advantage of. I know what I'm getting - great deals...period! Shop at hand-end places if you want your ass kissed.
