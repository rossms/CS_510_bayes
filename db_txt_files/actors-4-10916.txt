I only gave her 4 stars instead of 5 because I think she's gone down hill a little in recent years. Sure, her acting has improved as she's gotten better roles, but I'm talking about her appearance. I used to love her voluptuousness and curves, even the baby-fat in her face was appealing. Now, she's slimmed down (too much), looks hard, and has lost most of the girth of her formerly majestic sweater puppies. I don't know if this problem can be helped because she is getting old and may have hit the wall already. She's still beautiful, just not as sexy anymore.
