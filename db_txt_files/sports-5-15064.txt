KING_PERRY1@YAHOO.COM- THA WEIRDO GANGSTA BLOODZ A lot of people are upset, because a black man got a fair trial. If he was guilty then the jury would have found him guilty. O.J. gives me inspiration as a young African American. To overcome an obstacle so great is amazing. All the injuries he recived from people like that EM EM sucka. He's just mad. Trade places with O.J. how would you feel,punk
