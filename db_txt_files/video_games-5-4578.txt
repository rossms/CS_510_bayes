Finally, a game where you can control Star Wars-like space battles. I borrowed it from a friend one day and ended up buying my own. It has an intriguing storyline about a race of people trying to get back to their homeworld, Hiigara, from which they have been banished. Also includes a song by Yes (a good band from a long, long time ago) on the credits. It's just plain awesome. Not much else to it. And when Homeworld2 comes out it will be Awesome2.
