The best way that I know to evaluate an MBA Program is by the quality of its graduates. I have been impressed by the graduates that I have met of this program - the majority seem to be sharp, driven, and without a lot of the god's gift to the world / Prima Donna attitude of some of the elite programs. Friends of mine who have attended UT Austin have said that the professors are strong, that Austin is a great place to study, and that the International Program is suprisingly good.
