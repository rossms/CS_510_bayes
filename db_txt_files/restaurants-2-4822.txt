We have a new IHOP that opened last year. We tried breakfast there and it took nearly 2 hours to get our orders and we had to listen to all the waitress' problems. We won't go back. If you want breakfast go to a local cafe, especially one with lots of pickups out front. These chain places just don't measure up.
