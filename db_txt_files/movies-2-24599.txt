Again, I would have to agree wholeheartedly with Ocscargamblesfro. The only things this re-make had going for it were generally impressive make-up and special effects. It skirted cravenly away from the love angle between Wahlberg and the female ape, and the ending signified...what exactly? Burton certainly is talented, and there were some quality actors involved in the making of this film, but it was a definite misfire.
