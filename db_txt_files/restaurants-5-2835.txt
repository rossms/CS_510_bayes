Oh come on people! Sbarro's pizza tastes VERY good as long as you get slices that are fresh and have not been sitting. And that's coming from a pizza conoisseur who can actually spell the word conoisseur! Here in the Midwest (Ohio), there aren't too many places that serve genuine 'NY style' pizza, so places like Sbarro's are a GODSEND for discriminating pizza palates like mine. I usually just get plain cheese slices, and they blow away ANY pizza delivery chain in taste. In fact, I often stop by the mall and pick up a whole pie as opposed to having crap like Papa John's or Domino's delivered to my door.
