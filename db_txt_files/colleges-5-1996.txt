Fort Collins is a great college town where the weather is mild, but the Rocky Mountains rise up tall at the edge of town. The school has a nice big campus, and it is well maintenanced. I dig this school because the general attitude of the people here is real mellow. By the way, this town has more micro breweries per capita than any other town in the country.
