Not only is this the best true crime book I've yet to encounter(out of more than one hundred others), but it is also easily the best Norman Mailer book that I know of. The story of Gary Gilmore and his fight to die is an amazingly compelling read. This book's power hasn't lessened at all over the years. This is in my top three of all-time books.
