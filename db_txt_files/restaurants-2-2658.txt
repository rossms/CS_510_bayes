We loved McDonald's when I was a kid. The food really seemed good. But something has happened over the years. I think it all started when that insufferable clown, Ronald McDonald, starting showing up on the commercials. Then they had those ads with cheeseburgers dancing and singing through their buns! Since then, the service has gotten worse, and the food is increasingly bland.
