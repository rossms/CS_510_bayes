I personally love Trix, but also agree with Pontificator - the taste is too strongly artificial for regular consumption. However, the shapes are cute and the colors are bright and cheery. It tastes fruitier than Froot Loops and although it is high in sugar (14 grams per serving), it's oh so yummy! The boxex are brightly colored as well, which probably attracts young kids' eyes and makes them beg their parents for a box. The power of good marketing skills.
