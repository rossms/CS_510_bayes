This book is an all-time classic---represents the height of hope in the chasm of totalitarianism and despair. Anne was a courageous young lady who put her thoughts on paper and dared to do so even though danger was omnipresent. She somehow knew she would probably not live to see the end of the war, and her father, Otto, is deserving of even greater praise and courage when he was able to find and ultimately publish his daughter's diary after the Nazis had destroyed the house in which the Frank family was hidden. A must-read for everyone who values the sanctity of life and the indomitable human spirit.
