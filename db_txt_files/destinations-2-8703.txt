Skoal is an alright brand. I realize many people who dip skoal, are pussies. I don't mind a dip of skoal out of someone elses can. Unless its berry, mint, Wintergreen, vanilla or any of those flavors. Maybe a dip of Apple if I am feelin good. When it comes down to it, Skoal has got Natural goin for them in my book, and thats it.
