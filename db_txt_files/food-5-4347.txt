The chip alone is not very good (chili cheese flavor is better) but Frito Pie is great, the recipe is very simple. Heat one can of chili (I use Wolfman's) Grate some cheddar cheese while it's heating. Put a handful of Fritos in a bowl. Pour the chili over the Fritos, then put the cheese on top. Enjoy.
