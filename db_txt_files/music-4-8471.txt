This video is so bad, it's kinda good. I laughed straight through it, and even more when I realized it wasn't a parody. For him to do those moves, and wear those clothes while pretending to be super cool. I remember watching an interview with him and he started to rap: Ladies, I wanna rock with you, and later in the evening I'd like to pursue, Something, real sexy and nice, That's why the ladies call me, Vanilla Ice. Well he certainly thinks highly of himself...
