Good at what he does....Plays with a system that is exciting, scores a lot of points and can overwhelm an opponent. Texas Tech is a good ole football school. They win, but havent jumped to the next level and competed with the Elites on a yearly basis in the big stage. Tech seems to have a guy who got his program in a comfort zone with requisite wins, Bowl appearances and the occasional kid who goes to the pros. You'd think they'd want to become even more than what they are, but what they are isnt bad.
