Their recruiting is terrible. They lost top athletes in northern California because they said, he does not fit in this program (what's wrong, he's too good?). Some of the best in college are from the northern California area and Cal Berkeley doesn't even attempt to talk to them. Those players are at schools like USC, UCLA, Fresno St., Miami, Stanford, Oregon, OSU, WSU, UOW, etc.
