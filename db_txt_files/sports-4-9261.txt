What I like most about Stack is the fearlessness with which he takes the ball to the rack - the guy gets to the line 7+ times a game. He also is a pretty good shooter, and an unbelievable leaper which means that he is able to get a reasonable shot off, virtually whenever he wants to. I feel for him this year now that he has no talent around him, but I suspect he will put up a huge year statistically (which may be more important to him than winning anyway).
