(70 proof) Tried it one night, won't forget that one for a while. Had me praying to the porcelian god after only 6 shots (Takes me at least double that with most other stuff) Tastes like you are shooting cough syrup, best way to describe it without a long essay. Will get you messed up fast and not the good kind of messed up... Just stick to the non sugared up Bourbon...
