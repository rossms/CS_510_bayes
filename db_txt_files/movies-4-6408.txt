This is the horror film that started it all for Universal! Inspired heavily by the German horror films that preceeded it, The Phantom of the Opera is a great example of how silent horror movies are the best! All you need is Lon Chaney, one of the greatest actors of all time, his trusty mak-up kit and some excellent sets and camera work, and you got yourself one helluva horror picture! Chaney steals the show while his supporting cast is honorable as well. One of my favorites of the horror genre!
