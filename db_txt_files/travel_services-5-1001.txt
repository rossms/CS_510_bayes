The movers were great! They came on time and took extra care of my piano (which is like my child) they gave me a gaurenteed price and stuck to it and also allowed me to make a 2 month payment. and when my things arrived..they actually moved the big furniture to where i wanted it. thank you so much you guys for making my move so much less stressful. you guys are the best!!
