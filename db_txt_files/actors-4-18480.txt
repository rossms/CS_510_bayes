It's impossible to deny that Spielberg has been effective in tapping into the pulse of the American public with inventive pictures that probably seemed ridiculous before they became huge hits (I'm especially thinking of Jaws in 1975, Close Encounters in 1977, and then the Indiana Jones series circa 1980 or so). I think some of his more serious films have been rather flawed, so I'll leave him at a 4 but his overall talent is undeniable.
