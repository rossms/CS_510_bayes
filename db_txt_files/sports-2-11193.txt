Since the Big Ten added the Instant Review, Lloyd Carr/MeCheatAgain DOES NOT get the freebies as in the past. Most recently the ND game where the call was overturned. 5 officials in many games and all 5 lived in MeCheatAgain gave Lloyd game winning calls that were clearly BAD CALLS, so Lloyd no longer has biased officiating on his side. He continues to be outcoached in the big games.
