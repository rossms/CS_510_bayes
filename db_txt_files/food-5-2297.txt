Dove Milk Chocolate may be the most decadent, satisfying chocolate you can buy outside of specialty shops, and I'd dare say it would beat out a lot of the higher-priced gourmet and specialty chocolates in taste tests. If I really need a chocolate fix, this is what I want. Creamy, rich, dense and not too sweet . . . yum. The Dark chocolate is equally as satisfying. Before you say you don't like dark chocolate, try Dove's. It just might convert you.
