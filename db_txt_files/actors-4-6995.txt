I can't wait to see Wes Bentley in more films. I feel like he might have quite a range. I just saw The Claim and though the film was just OK, Bentley was quite good and he is very, very attractive. I thought American Beauty was wonderful, gave me hope for mainstream cinema and Bentley's performance was great. I hope he keeps making good choices in his projects and lets his body of work develop slowly so that we can watch him grow as an actor.
