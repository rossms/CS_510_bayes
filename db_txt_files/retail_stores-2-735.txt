Before you do any Christmas shopping at Old Navy - be certain that you fully understand the return policy. Or should I say lack of return policy. NO item can be exchanged without the receipt. The only exception is for any item that is EXACTLY the same. They will issue you a credit - mailed to your address within 10 to 14 business days! I will do my shopping elsewhere - I don't need to be treated like a criminal just because I attempt to exchange something. My advise SANTA shop somewhere else.
