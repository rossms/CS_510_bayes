Mud Island is a great place to visit! The Riverpark Museum is great for both kids and adults. You can rent a canoe and paddle around or take the monorail back to Front Street. It IS an attraction, especially if you go into the park and see the scale model of the Mississippi. All the information along the model gives all sorts of interesting history and geological info. Great educational yet fun activities for families.
