A 4.5. A very good movie takes place at the civil war. Nicole Kidman is good as Ada, the woman caught up in the war who tells Inman her boyfriend to come back to her. There is really two story lines. Ada and Ruby the farmgirl who helps her tend the land{Renee Zellweger is great in this part} and Inman who spends a year walking back to Ada and the people he encounters. This can be a pretty violent movie considering it is about war. Well done and acted though. A bit longer than I like, but good movie.
