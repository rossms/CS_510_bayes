I'm a little biased - it's always a little cheaper than Folgers (my first choice for shelf brands) but, more importantly, Hills threw a Badger pep rally in San Francisco when Wisconsin played California back in the 80's, before both schools were rated. Lousy game, but the Anchor Steam Beer at the rally was great!
