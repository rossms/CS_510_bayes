Black Eyed Pea is one very rare restaurant. There aren't too many around anymore, but I have a little story to tell you. I was on the road, starving and I see this sign for the restaurant. I walk in and the people greet you in costumes, and then serve you at a small little wooden table. I felt like I was at home, as they have a small little TV near you. The only lousy thing here is that their beans are so strange and tasteless, but I guess that's just the way my taste buds react to beans.
