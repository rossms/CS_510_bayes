Good Points - Few nice towns - Princeton, Cape May; Some good beaches, Atlantic City, proximity to NYC and Philly, a good mall around every street corner, great views of Manhattan from Jersey city. Bad Points - the environmental issues. Still I'll give it a 4. Guys, U don't have to pump your own gas !!
