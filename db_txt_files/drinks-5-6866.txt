Me and Tequila Patron go back a long time. Ever since I was seventeen and the guys in our neighborhood would go over to a friend's house who breeds pit bulls. We would watch sports and late night videos and just kick it. We never drank another type of Tequila besides Patron. One day we were trying to think of a name for one pit bull that no one bought when I, the genius, came up with Patron(Spanish for boss). That dog grew up to be the ugliest but sickest pit bull I've ever seen and my neighbor bought it.
