Excellent inside scorer, especially in the East. Athletic for his height, rebound well, blocks shots extremely well. They run a lot of isos for him, because he really dominates guys in one-on-one situations. Jump shooting is still a weakness, but no longer to the degree it was when he was 18. His passing needs improving. That's the only weakness I see.
