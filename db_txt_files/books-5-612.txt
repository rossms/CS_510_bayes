I have nothing bad to say about the books. The writer (Lemony Snicket has a funny way of writing his stories. He uses a differnt sort of humour, but it's still realy good. Even though the book is a bit depressing, it's still been written really well. This is one of my favourite books series. Concratulations Lemony Snicket, you did A wonderful job!
