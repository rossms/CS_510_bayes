My daughter is a Girl Scout. We weren't able to take pre-orders this year, so instead we bought a TON of them and then set up at grocery stores to sell them. We ended up with 5 cases left over. We sent one to a nephew in the Navy, then last week took the last four to a local hospital's chemo clinic. The kids let each patient choose their favorite box. The first to go? Thin Mints by a landslide. Most of these people felt terrible, with little or no appetite, yet they all opened their boxes on the spot. Says it all, huh?
