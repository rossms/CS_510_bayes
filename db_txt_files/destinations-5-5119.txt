It doesn't quite make it to 5 because unlike the rest of the new england states, it doesn't have a coastline at all. But it still has great fall foliage and seems pretty friendly. EDIT: It isnt the least populus state like somebody said, just for a correction, that is Wyoming, which is beside the point. I think Vermont is the only state in new enlgnad were pretty much EVERY town is one of those quaint friendly, comfortable new england towns that you hear about, read about, and see in movies. I have always though that it would be great to live in a place like that, so i will give vermont another star, 5!
