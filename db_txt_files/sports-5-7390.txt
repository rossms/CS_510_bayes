Baylor was the first guy to ever score 70 points in one game. He once averaged 19.8 rebounds and 34.8 points per game in the same season, at 6'5; another year, he went for 38.3 per game. The guy jumped like Doc or MJ; he was double teamed constantly, and was flat-out unstoppable. While he never won a title, not many players outside of Boston did either. Its kind of like arguing Pete Maravich wasn't a good college player because UCLA won all the NCAA tourneys back then.
