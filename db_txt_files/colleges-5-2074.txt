I graduated from the University of Michigan in 1992, and I just visited Ann Arbor for the first time in years. It made me incredibly nostalgic. My four years at Michigan couldn't have been more enjoyable, and I even managed to learn something while I was there. Nothing compares to the experience of football Saturdays - morning parties before the game, walking down State Street with thousands of other fans, and walking through the tunnel into the stadium for the first time.
