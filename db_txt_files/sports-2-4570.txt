Bobby Knight's act is so tired. While it is true that he runs a clean program and his players graduate, he coaches (and does everything) through intimidation. His mistreatment of the media is unforgivable and it is only a matter of time before he does something which the IU administration will have to act on. Please, Bobby, don't become another Woody Hayes.
