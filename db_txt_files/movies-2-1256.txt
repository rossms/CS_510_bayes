This was one of the most overrated action films of all time. Violence, gore, grossouts, and filthy language permeated the screen, and John Travolta was not nearly as good as he was in two great films of the late 70s- Saturday Night Fever and Grease. Quentin Tarrantino is certainly one of the most unique filmmakers of his time creating a bizzare, disturbing, and most of the time un-entertaining film which is not uplifting and certainly not enriching.
