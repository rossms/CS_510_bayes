The Bucs are the team to beat. They dominated in the Playoffs, and with the Addition of Jon Gruden to their already incredible defense they were able to win the Super Bowl for the first time in Buccaneers history. With the defense intact and the offense clicking, things will only get better. I look forward to a repeat next year with even great domination.
