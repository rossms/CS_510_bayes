i absolutely loved the original BarNone way back in the 80s and was devastated when it was discontinued. i never forgot about that chocolate bar. then one day about four or five years ago i gasped and shrieked in the supermarket when i saw it back on the shelves! my sister never saw my eyes so big! i never thought it would be out of the market again. had i known, i'd have bought the entire stock. now it's gone again and i'm back to my old devastated self. :(
