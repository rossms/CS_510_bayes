Our first purchase was a 1/2 carat marquis engagement ring. I broke my ring finger and had to have it cut off. I chose to let the manager @ whitehall do it. He was kind and gentle. Thanks to the warranty it was repaired for free and I had it back in 7 days. Did they call me...no, but they they told me it would be back in 7 days and it was there when I went to pick it up.We just purchased a Titanium and Gold band and my 3/4 carat guard both for 1900.00 on sale from 2700.00. I have no problem with whitehall or thier employees. We have bought 5 seperate pieces of jewelry from here and I couldnt be happier.
