Jon Gruden came to Tampa Bay, and delivered the impossible: Super Bowl Champion Buccaneers. He has a tireless work ethic, and one of the first things he said when they won the SB was that the offense shows room for improvement . How's that for a great coach? He can't even take five minutes to enjoy a Super Bowl victory without thinking about how he can improve the team! On top of superior coaching skills, he's got alot of personality as well. I hate to say it, but he really DOES look like Chucky when he makes one of those infamous facial expressions!
