This guy has talent. He combines speed and agility with ridiculous strength. (Kidd's probably the next in line when it comes to physical strength in point guards and he doesn't have 1/2 the build Baron does.) He's listed at 6'3, 225 which means he's probably about 6', tops, and it is a pleasure to watch this little guy improvise among the trees under the basket. He makes people look BAD.
