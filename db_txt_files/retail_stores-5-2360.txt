Anyone who does not give WinCo 5 stars has had a bad experience of some kind. If you look at facts and want the most groceries for your money WinCo is the only place to shop. Sorry Willie...you are not giving proper credit where it is due. Perhaps you were treated poorly because of your attitude in the first place. You seem to have an opinion on everything judging by all your responses. I will continue to shop Winco and highly recommend it to everyone who does not want to waste their money.
