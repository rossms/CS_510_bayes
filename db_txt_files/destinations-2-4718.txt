I did like Greenfield Village, Henry Ford Museum, the Detroit Institute of Art and Greektown was okay. But, literally nothing going on at night, jsut three blocks of Greektown and a coupe of casinos. The only city I have been in that looks more depressing at night is Havana. So much potential in Detroit, osme grand skyscrapers from the 20's, wide boulevards and some semblance of planning back then too. Its sad, becuase just by spending some major money by wholesale redevelopment, the place could be so nice.
