This Island is numero uno on my list, I love Bridgetown, it's a great city with great beaches and super people. We've been there twice now and we'd return every year if we could. I really liked the Boatyard, it's a cool cabana style bar on the beach that has great 2 for 1 deals, definitely worth a visit, it that's your type of thing. Also, check out the botanical gardens, they were absolutely breathtaking and we practically had the place to ourselves, really something else.
