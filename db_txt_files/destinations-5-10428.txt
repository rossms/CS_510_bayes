The drawback of Newports is also what makes them so great: that menthol blast freezes your lungs, but makes it easier to suck that smoke so deep into your lungs that you wonder whether it will ever come out, and taking the smoke in so deep really gives you a jolt of nicotine that hooks you hard and fast, and probably for life. I'm a loyal box 100s man of more than 20 years, and I'm hopelessly addicted. But the experience of taking that Newport smoke into my lungs is one of the greatest things I have ever experienced, and so I keep on with this habit. I'm wicked hooked, and I love it!
