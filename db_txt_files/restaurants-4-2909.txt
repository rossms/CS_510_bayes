Hey, how come the left gets their own ice cream chain? What's with all the political preaching. Food is food- leave it at that. What about the right? Don't they get their own ice cream chain with their own flavors: Iraqi Road, I Hate the French Vanilla and Smaller GovernMINT? The very idea of a political ice cream chain is just as bad as freedom fries. Despite the political preaching, this place is pretty good.
