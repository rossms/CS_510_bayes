I always try to be fair in these evaluations. I don't particularly like her, based on what I've seen of her in the media. Obviously, she needs some profound psychological help. She comes across as shrill and attention-starved, and (being shallow here) I don't find her all that sexy or attractive. But she's not without talent. It appears she can act and her music is actually, at its best, not all that bad. I hope she gets the help she needs and is able to fulfill her potential.
