I know most fast food places are only as good as the employees they have working in them. Well the Wendy's by my house may have the worst employees I've ever seen. Lethargic, sluggish kids who probably have trouble getting out of bed, let alone actually working. Sandwiches and fries are always just lukewarm, and always ask for any condiments at the drive-thru because you know they will not give you any. I do go occasionally for the chili, it is not too bad. The salads are OK also, they are pre-packaged and fresh, and you don't have to worry about some kid actually making the salad for you.
