MY dream car even had a chance to get a picture of a red 95 VT next to my TwinTurbo Z. Pictures are wonderful of the two cars together. Only negative is that the lamborghini is not a comparable price to the likes of 911 twinturbo or viper gts. yes, it is exotic sports car but it came out the same time as the Z32. Price of used one is wayy too high. But they are rare.
