Cal in the '60's had it all. I wouldn't trade my experience there, educational or cultural, for anything. I earned my ABMAPhD from Cal and although I've been gone for 30 years, still consider that time one of the most extraordinary in my life. Cutting edge faculty w/ social conscience involvement, a politically active aware student body, an unparalleled cultural milieu. My only regret is that I took it for granted. I didn't have a clue how rare it was.
