As I mentioned in the Almond Joy section, due to the influence of their advertising campaign in the 60 s, I can never think of one of these candy bars without thinking of the other. Both are good, but when I don t feel so much like a nut, I would, of course choose Mounds over Almond Joy. If you can t choose, just get one of each and save yourself the stress!
