After smoking Doral full flavor for years I didn't think I could smoke anything else but today my husband bought the Marlboro Blend No. 27 and I have to admit I was totally SHOCKED to say the least. These are wonderful and please for all of our sake that likes them don't take them off the shelf I will for sure being buying more as long as they don't sky rocket like most of the other brands. Keep up the wonderful work. Chastity
