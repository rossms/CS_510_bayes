I own a 2000 4Runner which I purchased new and I am extremely pleased with it. It's extremely reliable, unlike previous SUV's we've owned (Blazers) which we were afraid to drive more than about an hour from home because they were ALWAYS either breaking down or leaving us stranded somewhere because of their constant repair problems. I will always stick with Toyota for their reliability, my husband purchased a new Matrix last year and is very pleased with that too. I plan on kepping my 4Runner for years to come!
