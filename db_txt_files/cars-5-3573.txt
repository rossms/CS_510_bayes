I have owned 4 Eddie Bauers over the past 12 years. I just lost my present one due to the hurricane. I have test drove all the others within the 30,000 price range that had what I am looking for in a SUV. Sunroof, V-8, 6 CD changer, satallite radio, no 3rd row seat, roof rack, and the best is the keyless entry on the exterior door, Cannot find that in any other within 12,000 more. I have had every color it seems but I still this auto SUV gives me the best bang for "my" buck for the extra's that are important to me.
