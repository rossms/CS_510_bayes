Lived in metro Washington two different times. Some say it has Northern charm and Southern efficiency. It has gotten more Northeastern with the rudeness and bad drivers, but it still is a lovely city with fascinating history and architecture. The Smithsonian alone put it on top of my list of fav cities to visit.
