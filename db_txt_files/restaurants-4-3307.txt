It's another good pizza chain. Their sauce is different from Dominoes and Pizza Hut, and its good. Their cheese amd toppings are good as well. They don't offer deep dish, but I've heard a rumor that they are going to expand it in their menus in 2002. They don't have the other menu items (specifically cinnamon sticks) that the others have, either. But, their delivery is lightning fast. One time it took only 18 minutes from order! Their prices are also reasonably set.
