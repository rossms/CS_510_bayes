I am not a huge horror story fan but this is one i liked. Two Americans visit London and get attacked by a werewolf. One dies the other survives. and now to his horror he becomes a werewolf on a full moon.It is interesting to see the human reaction this character has when he realizes what is happening beyond his control. he does not want this to happen to him and has to decide how he can stop it.. there is some blood and gore in this, but what I found interesting is there was humor too. well acted pretty good movie.
