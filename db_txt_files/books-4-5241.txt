Not my usual type of book, but for some reason I really like this. The storyline is simple (and yes, slightly unbelievable..) and well structered. The characters are well rounded and it makes you sympathise with what is happening. I think one reason why I like this is because it follows the family throughout the decades. So you get to read about Meaghan when she is a little girl and get to know her family, then the priest and the aunt. Then eventually Meaghan has children of her own and you get to see her and her mother in a different light. Its very well written and has enough going on to keep you reading.
