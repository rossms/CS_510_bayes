This movie holds title of Greatest Special Effects Achievement in my book. Lord of the Rings can't live up to this one. Considering the time period it was made, this movie blew away just about everyone. The plot was good but not too overdone, which made it easy to focus on the great characters, humor, and action taking place on screen instead of pondering about the storyline. It's every kid (and every adult who never grew up)'s dream to see a movie with real-life looking dinosaurs. Astounding film making here. This is a movie I will watch countless times.
