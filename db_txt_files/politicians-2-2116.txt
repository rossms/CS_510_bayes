He's an idiot. Anyone who thinks that government can do anything better and/or more efficiently than private enterprise is out of their mind. Instead of trying to take over transmission lines he should be creating incentives for private industry to expand their infrastructure. He can leave a legacy of being the governor in charge when the various fuel sources drove us to despair. Record highs for gas, natural gas, diesel, electricity have occurred under his watch with higher prices coming. The only good thing about his tenure in office is that before he's done he'll destroy any national aspirations he has.
