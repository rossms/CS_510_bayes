This is an extremely detailed fantasy epic. Too much, may I ad. Although like the Hobbit, it is the best of fantasy, JRR Tolkien goes, I'm afraid to say, with too much detail. Of course not all think so, but I think that he wanders off the tale of the ring-bearer a few too many times. Most of this over-detailing is in the Fellowship, so if you get through the first book than the second two will be easier to comprehend.
