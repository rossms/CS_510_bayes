I have been smoking since I was 14 years old, and I have smoked many brands of cigaretts. The brands that I had smoked always left a bad taste in my mouth. I recently started smoking Prime Times about a year ago and I have yet to go back or swich to another brand. I even have my co-workers smoking them. Prime Times have many different flavors and so far I prefer the CHERRY AND RASBERRY ones. There are others that are not that bad, but these are the two that I like the most.
