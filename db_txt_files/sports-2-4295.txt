Great Job Tubby. Another SEC championship and another lack luster choke job in the NCAA Tournament. Other'n the year he 'minded the store' with Pitino's players in 1998, he's not accomplished anything in the 'real' Tournament. Great job Tubby. Lit'l Tubby, mm mmm mmmm, he sure did like staying in the bathtub. Shoulda stayed in the bathtub.
