Ben the MAN!! Heck yeah. So you diss him cause he can't shoot. Then have YOUR best defender out-defend Big Ben. It's like staring in the sun too long-painfully blinding. I'm not saying he should win the MVP award. That goes to big scorers AND defenders. But where's the respect at? How long a guy's gotta beat your team defensively before you give him credit?
