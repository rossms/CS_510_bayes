Again,theonlyproblem I had here was it is way too expensive to fly to/ get a hotel at.(Reason for the 4 not a 5) However, the beach we goto is near St. Armands Circle, a cute little shopping area just before Key Leto(sp?) The beach has very few patrons, crystal clear water and gorgeous white sand. The drive over the new bridge over Sarasota Bay is gorgeous. This is definitely the place I want to retire.
