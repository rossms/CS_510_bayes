Positive Attributes: Massachusetts is as ery beautiful state and seems to have something for everyone to enjoy. Its historical significance alone makes it a great spot for tourists. It really seems that Massachusetts is a place for practically anyone. There's the big city life in Boston, the small town rural life in the western part of the state, and the beaches along the cost (Martha's Vineyard is simply amazing). Minuses: The people of this state are very unfriendly, at least most of them- espescially to southernors.
