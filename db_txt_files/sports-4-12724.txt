Oklahoma is a great team but the person called SOONER above is a real LOSER - he put 1-star for Miami just out of spite - all of his opinions should be discredited. SOONER YOU ARE A PATHETIC LOSER - HOW MANY TIMES DID MIAMI SPANK YOUR OVER-SIZED, UNDER-BRAINED RED-NECK TEAM.... Also, for all Users who are not from Oklahoma - PLEASE DO NOT PUT 1-STAR JUST BECAUSE YOU DON'T LIKE A TEAM - LET'S TRY TO BASE THINGS ON TALENT.
