Attempting to produce a sequel to Margaret Mitchell s ultra-classic Gone with the Wind gave Alexandra Ripley some pretty big shoes to fill. The results were what I would term fair to good but in no way exceptional. Still, I found myself enjoying the book much more than I expected to yet still not nearly as much as I did Gone with the Wind itself. While Scarlett did not soar to the heights of its classic predecessor, it was still an enjoyable trip back to the mid-1800 s. It even inspired me to make a two day stop in Charleston, SC on a trip home from Florida not long after reading it.
