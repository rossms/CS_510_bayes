To all of you who posted below complaining about the age difference, you obviously did not get the movie. The age difference was what the movie was about. Did you not see the scene where the grandmother spoke with Gere's character about not hurting another member of my family? He had already dated and seperated from Winona's character's mother. The age difference was as much apart of the story as Winona's illness. I liked the movie a great deal. I thought it was thought provoking and original. It was very much a slice of life as we know it these days.
