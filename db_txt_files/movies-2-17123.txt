a junk movie hyped just enough to insure it would be a success. it cost 9 million to make and made 40 million; a flop by any other standards. i agree with Beelzebub(not my first time agreeing w/the devil) as soon as the main characters came on the film i instantly hated them and couldnt wait for them to die. but even their death was unsatisfactory. the movie was like being caught in the constant flux of horror movie anticipation w/o the fear-based release. that said, i give the film two stars b/c the female lead showed some impressive and bold nudity.
