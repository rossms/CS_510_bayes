I have a 00 Crew Cab SE V6 and I'm impressed so far - The engine has plenty of power, There is plenty of room inside (no like the toyota tachoma), drives *great* and I'm impressed with the overall quality of the vehicle. Ground clearance could be better, but it's not bad. Great vehicle! And if it helps.. there are plenty of nissan trucks on the raod with 200,000 + miles and still going strong.
