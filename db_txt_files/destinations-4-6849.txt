North Dakota is bitterly cold much of the year, and I hope never to live in the northern part of the country. However, I did spend a week there one summer, and even though there wasn't much to look at, I met a lot of incredible people. Really good people more than make up for a bleak landscape. I especially enjoyed the little town of Goodrich. And Bismarck had a great radio station. I enjoyed North Dakota so much that a couple of years later, I went back to visit.
