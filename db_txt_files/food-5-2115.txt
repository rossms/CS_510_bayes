Snickers is the best candy bar. Chocolate, peanuts, caramel and nougat come together in perfect harmony. Each bite is a symphony of flavour, with sweetness balanced flawlessly by a slight saltiness; the texture is no less exquisite, with the chewiness of the nougat and caramel being the yin to the crunchy peanuts' yang. What more can be said, Snickers is great!
