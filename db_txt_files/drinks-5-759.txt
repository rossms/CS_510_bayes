This is a great beer well suited for hearty meals like steaks and mexican foods. Its flavor is simple, and bold enough to keep me drinking. This is my standard beer when I go to most restuarants, since it's not expensive and more interesting than most other domestics out there. It is indeed manufactured by Coors (unibev), which is really a suprise. This is the only Coors product I enjoy.
