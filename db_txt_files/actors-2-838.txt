I like John Ritter, but he hardly belongs in this list, and no way does he deserve to be considered a classic actor. He did some films, the most memorable was Sling Blade, but Ritter's place was television. If Ritter is on here then where is Ray Milland, John Barrymore, Lionel Barrymore, Charles Boyer, Adolphe Menjoue, Gregory Peck, John Garfield, James Mason, Paul Henreid, and Frank Sinatra?
