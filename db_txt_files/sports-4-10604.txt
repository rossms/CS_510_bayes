Richt is terrible in BIG GAMES. Notice how we've managed to lose several games the past few we should have won. Richt has losing records against Florida and Auburn, and he's split with the VOLS. He's great at recruiting and he's a good coach, but where's the big wins? The past four years we started high in the polls, had a chance to go all the way, and somehow managed to lose two or three really close games every year due to bad play calling in the clutch.
