If anyone needs to be fired is Defensive Coordinator Willie Martinez. His secondary and linebackers look like they didn't want to be at the game tonight (Sugar Bowl). They made the West Virginia offense look like the Indianapolis Colts. The whole entire defense out to be ashamed and embarrassed for their performance out there tonight. Oh and Georgia needs to get a defensive coach that will keep his players motivated regardless of the situation.
