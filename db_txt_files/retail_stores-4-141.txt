An excellent bookstore, and a great friend when I was an undergraduate. I do remember that they wouldn't get the Anarchist Cookbook for me in the 1980s, so that cost them a star, but I own a LOT of books purchased there, including my first Nietzsche and my first Camus. Moe's next door is also superb, and quite different (though Mr. Moe's cigar was a famous blemish on the otherwise wonderfully bookmusty air)
