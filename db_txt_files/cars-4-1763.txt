small, economical, zippy, fun and low maintenance. I have a new one (2001) and so far so good, no problems w/engine or exterior parts. Only thing that makes this car not the best is the weird peeling of interior handle...strange protective coat I guess otherwise great car! (not for the very small or very tall seem to have too many blind spots for them)
