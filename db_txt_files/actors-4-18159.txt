As an actress, Lesli is somewhat difficult to rate, considering her character Molly is somewhat of a nutcase. But I do believe she does Molly well... at least considering the kind of character Molly is, someone you love to hate (or maybe someone you just hate). Not to mention, she's pretty stunning to look at, even moreso than most soap opera women...
