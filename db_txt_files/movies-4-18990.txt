Excellent horror film and deserves its place among the most frightening movies of all time! James Whale is one of my favorite directors and it pains me to know that he is one of the most underappreciated directors of all time. Having said that, of his four Universal horror films, FRANKENSTEIN is his worst. Now that's not to take anything away from it, rather when compared to THE OLD DARK HOUSE, THE INVISIBLE MAN and especially BRIDE OF FRANKENSTEIN, it is downgraded considerably. But, on its own, it is a good film.
