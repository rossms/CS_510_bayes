I might be generous in giving this a 4. While as beautiful as any Tim Burton film (even more maybe), you know there's problem when the villain needs to give a three minute speech near the end to show how loose plot lines tie together. And Johnny Depp isn't given much room to do anything of interest. Still, its one of those rare movies that uses every inch of the big screen.
