This is a great advantage if you are in any type of sales, customer service or even inside sales. It keeps track of all of your contacts and you can sync it w/ your microsoft outlook for times and dates that you have made for the future. There a lot of other programs out there like this, but I feel that this is one of the best. It also has reminders alarms so that if you are sitting behind the computer and loose track of time, it will tell you that you have a meeting/phone call ect w/ in your specified amount of time. It's great!
