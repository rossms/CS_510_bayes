Oh, for Gods sake when I saw this the first thing I thought of was my maths teacher. He actually made up a quetion in our maths test referring to the fact that he wanted one of these bikes. I asked him afterwards why he thought of such a bizzare question and he said he wanted a Ninja.I'll give it a 5 because the question he made was really funny (which is a bit lame, but I'm being honest)
