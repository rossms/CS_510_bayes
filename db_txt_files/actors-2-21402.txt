For Frannyv, this was probably her,out of what I know,only and most likely last role. The Nanny was a hit in the beginning but it's numbers and plot decreased until the end. Obviously you gotta take points off for that voice. I'll put a gun in my mouth before I have to spend the day talking to her. Then we had to de ja vou with her all over again with that actress who played Janice in Friends. Second, I never really liked The Nanny and I think she played herself which isn't that great of an accomplishment so Fran you get two stars.
