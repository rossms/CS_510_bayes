A good game with a couple pro's and cons.The mini games are an improvement but some of them are just plain bad.Multiplayer is awesome.Single player is alright but playing it alone for hours and hours will leave you with bordom.The graphics aren't top-notch though but they pass nonetheless.The sound is good,but hardly anything special.Good game,I reccomend it. :)
