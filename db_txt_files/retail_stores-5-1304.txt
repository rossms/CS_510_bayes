I've had great experiences with Nordstrom. While most of their stuff is pretty pricey, the quality and selection are both great. They have a great shoe department and I buy all of my dress shirts there (the store-brand shirts are great and the lowest priced ones are pretty reasonable and last a long time). Plus, the service is great. Lastly, I don't know what that other reviewer is talking about with respect to credit cards. Maybe they don't take the Discover card (just a guess), but I've never had a problem with my Visa or Amex.
