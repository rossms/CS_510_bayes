Amazing, breath-taking images of California. Eight stories (height of an IMAX flick) of Yosemite Falls comes as close to being there as you'll get without actually being there. Though you should see Yosemite for yourself, there were other parts of this movie that showed parts of CA most will never see themselves...like the view from an eagle's nest, from the tops of the tallest Redwoods, and the likes. Though IMAX technology seemed overkill for some of the stories (the otter piece, for example), this movie is a must-see for anyone who appreciates nature or beautiful cinematography of the outdoors.
