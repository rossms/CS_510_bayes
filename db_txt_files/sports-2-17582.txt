The Chiefs aren't really preforming like they used to. The hav no talent on the ground attack. And right now they are going to change choaches for the 4th time in ten years. There defense has many flaws because of the loss of Derrick Thomas. They have a lot of rookies and not many veterans. The quaterback could use a little work to become faster, more accurate in passsing, and run the ball more. They also don't have the guts to pass long. I think that with a little help and slim fast this team could fight back and have a perfect season. 16-0, I hope!
