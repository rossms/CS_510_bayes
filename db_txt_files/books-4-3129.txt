Very freaky. I am very curious about Stephen King, where does he get these ideas. Very disturbing theories in this book, which made it an excellent horror read. He always teases you with the lovely Maine setting, the happy little family and then whacks you with the evil underlying theme. The book was much more terrifying than the movie.
