Personally, I'm indifferent to Sen. Santorum because he has yet to say or do anything of consequence -- but he has recently become the darling of the Republicans and his name has shot to the top of this RateItAll list of American Politicians. So, although he may not be a great statesman, he has apparently mastered the art of politics better than most of his peers, and has discovered that homophobia plays very well in Middle America. This suggests that, for gays and lesbians, the United States may not be the ideal place to live at this moment in its history.
