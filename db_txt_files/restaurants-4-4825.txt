I like the IHOP restaurant in my hometown. Their food is very good, but their pancakes could be improved. The pancakes I get peel in layers and they're usually mushy. But their scrambled eggs and their stuffed French toast are excellent! My family and I eat there every so often. I hope their stuffed French toast stays on their menu for years to come. Other than the way IHOP usually makes their pancakes, I have no complaints.
