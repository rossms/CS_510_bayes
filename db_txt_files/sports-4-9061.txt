I had never seen this guy before halfway through this year's NBA season. Is this guy for real? Is he the real deal? He sure looks like it to me. To think that Italy is now producing people like him. Wow. He might as well be black. He's very athletic and has a great all-around offensive game. I think it has no weaknesses. He's quick, instinctive, flashy and smart, too. I hope he lasts a long time in the NBA. It would be nice to see a few more white people, especially ones like him.
