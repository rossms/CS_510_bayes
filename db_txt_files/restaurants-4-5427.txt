Shopping is done its late your tired, you don't feel fussy, let's go to Ryan's. I know its no quality restaurant but for the money its got to be worth it. $9 for all you can eat and drink. Some are better than others i agree. The fried chicken and honey butter rolls give Ryan's the 4th star for me alone. Sometimes the fruits are not ripe but the ice cream and cookies and cakes doh! i'm getting hungry, i steer clear of the cat fish though, i reserve all pond life for Red lobster and even then i stare at it curiously for a couple of minutes first.
