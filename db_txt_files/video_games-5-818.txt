I will say this is by far my family's favorite game ever. We used to play it at least 3 times a week faithfully. We always play the whole card, and it takes hours to finish one game this way. But we dont care, it is such great fun. Yahtzee is a classic game that I will love forever. It helps bring families together, and for that alone it deserves 5 stars.
