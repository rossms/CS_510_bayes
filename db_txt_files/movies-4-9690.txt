Very funny and charming. Perfect Will Ferrell movie and has a great supporting cast with veteran actors James Caan, Ed Asner, Bob Newhart and Mary Steenburgen. Zooey Deschanel adds a nice touch as Jovie and you can see why Buddy(Ferrell) would fall for her. Now I think Will Ferrell is very funny at what he does, but he's a rather limited actor. However this movie is perfect for Will Ferrell fans and even those who don't like Ferrell will laugh. It has a nice holiday spirit.
