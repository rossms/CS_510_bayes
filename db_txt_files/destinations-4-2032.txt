You should definitely visit Singapore. It's clean and beautiful. The food is marvelous. Don't forget to visit the food centers, such as Newton and Tiong Bahru. These places are one-of-a-kind. You can get into the shopping mood when you go to Orchard Rd. The prices are not that great though. I think the longest time you can stay here is a week. After that, you'll get bored of it. Afterall, it's a small island. :)
