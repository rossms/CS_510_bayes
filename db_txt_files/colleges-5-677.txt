Boston College Law School is a great place to be! All the people are extremely friendly and open. The professors and support staff are amazingly helpful. Career Services has so much time for all the students. I am very impressed with this institution. I disagree with the comment about it being so-so if you want to leave New England. All the top law firms from around the country interview about BCLS, and all the students I know who want to leave New England are doing so, with a great job.
