Eckersley was a solid starter for a number of years, but it is as a reliever that he is best remembered. In his prime, he was as dominant as a reliever has ever been, posting an unbelievable 0.61 ERA one season. One of the main reasons for Eckersley's success as a reliever was that he rarely if ever walked people - once walked a ridiculously low 4 batters in over 60 innings one year. He did choke in giving up the home run to Kirk Gibson, but that's part of the burden of a reliever - some people will only remember the games that you blew rather than how many time you come in and slam the door.
