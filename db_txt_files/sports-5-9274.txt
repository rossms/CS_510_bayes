Antoine is the most underrated player in the NBA today. He is a very good passer, shooter, and rebounder. For a big man, he dribbles pretty well also. Walker is a great competitor who always wants to help daaaaa C's win. Right now he is ranked below Peja, GHill, the Mailman, David Robinson, Alonzo Mourning (who I might add has not played in one game this season) Allan Houston, and although his being ranked behind all those guys ticks me off immensely, he is also ranked behind TODD MACCULLOCH!!!! All I have to say to that is wow.
