Christina has a soulful voice. Not all the songs on her album have no meaning at all for example I TURN TO YOU and REFLECTION are great songs. Maybe if people just listened to the words instead of worrying about what she looks like and how she presents herself then maybe you people would not say that her music has no meaning. Christina has a beautiful voice and obviously a lot of self-confidence.
