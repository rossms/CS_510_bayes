Karl Dorrell has got this team back to being a sustantial team in the PAC 10. They played very consistant football this year and competed well with teams like CAL and USC. Both teams rates in the top 5 in the country. The program has a way to go, but his progress is a testament to his efforts at recruiting and coaching.
