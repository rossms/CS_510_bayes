Okay, so the Midshipmen of Canoe U aren't the best football team in the Nation. But they are Number One when it comes to the most important job of all, training the most powerful and best fighting men in the world. They may not be the best football players, but I am certainly glad they are on our side on the battlefield of the high seas. Then purpose of the Naval Acadamy is to build tomarrow's leaders today. And to beat Army!
