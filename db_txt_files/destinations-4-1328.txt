A strong intelligent country, I have some very good friends from Germany. I don't understand their politics, they're unwillingness to help the USA in it's fight against terrorism. You'd think judging from Germany's past it would do a better job fighting against oppression. Maybe being too close to France the laziness and cowardly nature is rubbing off. But I still rate it a 4.
