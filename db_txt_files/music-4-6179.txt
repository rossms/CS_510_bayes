Limp Bizkit is one of those AMAZING group of people that only comes around every once in awhile. Fred Durst is the MAN, he does everything he can to incorporate his fans into what he does (which is cool in my book), and he just looks so damn cute! Wes is the shiznit, and the drummer guy (whatever his name might me) is a cute kid. As for their music, I'm not the HUGEST fan, but they still put on an AWESOME show!!
