Ellen DeGeneres is one of the most clever comedians of our time. I respect her creativity and it seems that she is really dedicated to each show that she does. However, I am not homophoebic, but I really did not believe that the entire world had to know that Ellen was a lesbian. Overall, she seems like a really sweet, sincere and genuine person, and I have a lot of respect for her as a comedian, but I believe that she had a few altier motives when she announced that she was gay.
