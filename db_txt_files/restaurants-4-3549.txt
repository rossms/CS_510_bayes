For the price of the pizza they serve, it is really good in my opinion. There are no pizza chains in this country that can serve a good pizza like Little Ceasar's for the discount prices they offer. Even Domino's doesn't come close. Good ! I recommend it. Their spaghetti is pretty nasty however, so they lost one star for that.
