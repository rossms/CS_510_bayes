Jimmy Carter is #1 of all American Presidents. He is the finest example of Christian values, honesty, integrity, wisdom, peacefulness, and hard work in the field of human rights everywhere. I admire J. Carter more than anyone else in public life past or present. I think he reflects Jesus' values and shines with the light of faith in his work and his life. I admire him as a leader, a role model, and a Christian.
