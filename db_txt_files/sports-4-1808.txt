You have to give the braves credit. They won a very tough division with a bunch of rookies gettin the job done. They have one of the best managers in the game in Bobby Cox. The man knows how to coach. Its going to be fun to see how francoer and those other rookies are going to handle the pressure of post season play, but wit guys like smoltz, furcal, giles, and the ageless julio franco they should make the nlds quite fun to watch and in the post season anything can happen.
