bought my first jeep when i moved here from tha outback in '96. it was a dubbed-out buggy. tinted windows, bass blasting system. i was sittin' on 20's. got more tail in that bucket than a walabee in a fox-den. yeah, had to beat tha lasses off with me walk-about stick. more shelias than a bloke can poke, if ya hear me. if not. . .don't worry. it's a jeep thing, you wouldn't understand.
