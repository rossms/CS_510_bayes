Rhode Island is very small- but its a fun state for visitor, resident and newcomer alike. Providence is a wonderful city, with everything: great schools, art, culture, as well as incredible places to eat. Newport is fantastic, with history, mansions and art. The state is also blessed with great beach side resorts that offer golden sands and surf. No hype here- just history, culture and the sea at its best.
