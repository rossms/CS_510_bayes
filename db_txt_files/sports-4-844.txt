The thing that strikes me most about Jones is that he is only 23. Since he has been in the league for so long, it is amazing that he is still that young. He is truly a special defensive player. His jump on the ball is the best around and he gets to just about everything in CF for the Braves. This year, he has also blossomed into a very productive hitter and got a well deserved start in the All-star Game. It's only a matter of time until he is considered among the best in the game and a perrenial MVP candidate.
