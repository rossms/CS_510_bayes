There are many reasons to love this state and many reasons to dislike it. Great diversity in people and landscapes- much of it exciting and wonderful. It is very expensive to live in most parts of this state now- and that is one of the most negative factors. I have allways enjoyed my many visits here- California has much physical beauty.
