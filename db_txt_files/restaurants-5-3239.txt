For a chain pizza joint, this one rocks. Imagine, they actually use cheese rather than uncooked dough in the topping. I can taste every ingredient in the works pizza. The veggies crunch, they are so very fresh. Very consistant. Decent delivery folks, to boot. A huge cut above the other chains in this neck of the woods.
