I'm guessing that the original Nigel Kneale script was potentially one of the best horror movies ever. Then it was tainted with typical stalk-and-slash nonsense by other writers and Kneale had his name removed. Tragic. It still has visceral impact though, and rises to be almost equal to - though far different than - the original Halloween.
