What was Anthony Hopkins doing in the Chris Rock mess. There is not that much action and what there is mostly feature's Chris' character running for his life. The story is thing and the acting flat, you get the feeling Hopkins just wants to get it over with. All in all watchable but bad script and flat acting and to top it of Chris is not funny even when he trys.
