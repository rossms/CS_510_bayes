I love these. I've never tried the original ones but I love Cheddar and sour cream baked lays ruffles (they're all made by frito lay) and I haven't found anything yet that beats baked Cheetos Crunchier. However, I did try baked Doritos and just couldn't stand them, they had no flavor whatsoever and were soft, not crispy. I'll probably try the original baked lays at some point but I'd really like to try the bbq baked flavor.
