I know it's been around awhile but I'm not sure I tried it or a similar one called Chocola. Somehow the idea of pouring chocolate into an unidentified liquid substance never really appealed to me. Then again, I was never much of a fan of chocolate milk either. The name makes me chuckle though - reminds me of a Far Side cartoon - galley slaves all rowing away and this one skinny guy is holding up his hand saying, Yoo hoo, yoo hoo - I'm getting a blister.
