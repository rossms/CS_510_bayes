Actually, 5 and a half stars. Luxurious, smooth, quiet, powerful, beautiful, incredibly reliable, sexy, expensive looking. Certainly not a little boy's racer toy. Sorry, but the build quality is better than Mercedes, BMW, Nissan, Mazda, etc. There are a number of faster cars that are cheaply built, and many pricier ones that aren't nearly as well made. It makes you feel like Mr. Shogun when you're driving around!
