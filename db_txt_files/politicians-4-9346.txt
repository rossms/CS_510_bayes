Civil War veteran.. The first to put electricity in the White House, but he and his wife were afraid to touch the switches.. Elected exactly a hundred years after George Washington and celebrated by reenacting Washington's inauguration in New York City.. He and William Henry Harrison are the only grandfather and grandson ever elected President.. Good administrator.. Stand-offish, brusque, and formal. Referred to in his time as "the human icicle." Alienated almost every political boss within the Republican party - the very people who had gotten him elected.
