Most people I know think these things taste like cardboard, but I swear I like them better than regular Lay's. Regular potato chips taste too greasy to me. But Baked Lay's have most of the flavor without the oily slime. Whenever I get a sandwich at a deli these days, a little bag of Baked Lay's is always my first choice for chips to go along with it.
