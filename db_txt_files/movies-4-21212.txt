This film has a most hokey premise, but the choreography and performances make up for it. Michael Kidd, the choreographer, is an unsung genius of Hollywood, and he devised some of the most difficult, athletic dance steps ever captured on film for this picture. Russ Tamblyn, once again, proves himself to be one of the most underrated song and dance men in Hollywood history. Why this guy wasn't built up to be a big star is beyond me.
