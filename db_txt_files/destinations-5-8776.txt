Been dippin Copenhagen for over 15 years, I recently switched to Copenhagen Black, it is pure satisfaction to dip. I put about 7-8 drops of wild turkey in each can to give it that extra bourbon flavor. Copenhagen is the KING of all dips and the ONLY dip for serious, hard-core dippers. My favorite container to spit in is an old pepsi can with the top punched out. Normally, after the first 3-4 spits, I just gut the rest.
