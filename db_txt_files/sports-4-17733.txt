I wish they had a 3 1/2, but I'll give them the benefit of the doubt. True Tampa shut Vick down, but Tampa pretty much shut everyone down. Add in free agent acquisition Price at receiver, and suddenly Vick has a huge downfield target. Tampa shut Vick down due to speed, but NOBODY in the NFL has neer the team speed Tampa does. Their defense statistically ranked as average, but look at their points per game. It was in the top quarter of the NFL. That's more important than how many yards they allow. Bend but don't break defense shows how much heart this young team really has.
