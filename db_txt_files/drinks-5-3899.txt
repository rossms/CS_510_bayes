The martini gets five stars because it's my own personal favourite. But some people I know can't drink them. It's worth remembering that this cocktail is a strong drink and generally the Coke with my Chivas Regal please! crowd will find it an aquired taste. It's also easy to screw a martini up by not mixing it properly. In some cases, the hostility of some to the martini can be ended by making them one that hasn't been butchered. It IS an art form.
