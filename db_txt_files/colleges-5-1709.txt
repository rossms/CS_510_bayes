NYU is a great experience for students who want to skip traditonal college nonsense. Instead of keg parties and football games, one can see a Broadway production, hear jazz at Small's, or drink homemade beer at McSorley's. Also, NYU has an excellent faculty and there are plenty of intership opportunities. I disagree with Claude - most departments at NYU, with the exception of the School of Ed (But doesn't that apply to most universities? Sorry, it had to be said) are first-rate.
