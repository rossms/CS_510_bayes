Now Fritos, there's a treat for me. I believe it started long ago, back in my early childhood years. There's nothing like fritos (regular, you can keep those huge scoop things and the bbq ones) and Helluva Good french onion dip. Another delight is Fritos crushed up inside a good old peanut butter jelly sandwich. Comfort food.
