Nassau is a very real, beautiful place. By real I mean you see real people, Bahamians, and a real, working marketplace. People say it's impoverished, well, it's not any worse except that snotty tourists don't want to see how real people live. Nassau is lovely, and the people are very nice. There are a lot of tourists, however, and the island is rather dirty in some spots. It's a shame they don't take care of their paradise better.
