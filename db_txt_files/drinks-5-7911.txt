I am the biggest Old Grand Dad fan of them all. Not you! I have the logo tattoed on me forehead and I peel and stick all the labels on my car windows. I make and sell jewelry from the lids. You should see my collection of bottles, just drive by my mom's house and look in my window. They should let you buy OGD with stamps, because it replaces meals. Also, my kids need to buy some more, I am out. Spill a little down your collar, smells better than Aquo Velvet. A complex, refined and elegant blended beverage for sophisticated gentlemen like mine own. Cheers.
