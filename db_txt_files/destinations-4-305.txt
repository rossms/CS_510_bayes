Brisbane is probably the best city in Australia, it's like a lesser-known Sydney or Gold Coast without the tackiness, hype or rude people. There don't appear to be a lot of tourists around, though and it a sub-tropical climate doesn't suit everyone but it is still a very good place to live and I'd recommend it as a tourist destination-just watch out for strong coastal winds.
