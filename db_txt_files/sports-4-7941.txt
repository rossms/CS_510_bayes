LeBron is currently averaging more points then any other rookie to come out of high school in the history of the N.B.A. This list includes Kevin Garnett, Tracy McGrady, Kobe, and Jermain O'neal. So to the people who have ranked James terrible or bad--- What was your opinion of Kobe and others when they were rookies? They probably weren't good at all, if you truly think that LeBron is terrible.
