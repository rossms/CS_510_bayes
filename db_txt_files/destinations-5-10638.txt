Fav handrolled cigarette. A good deal and a nice bold flavor that doesn't have a tainted taste that I noticed in other handrolled tobaccos like Zig-Zag, Top, or Bugler. These are pretty rich as I mentioned before. Rolling takes a little practice. There are guides online as to how to do it. I would definitely recommend it if you're looking for a smooth self-rolled smoke.
