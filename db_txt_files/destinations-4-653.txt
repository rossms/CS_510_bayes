The flavor of the island has deteriorated since it has become such a popular cruise ship stop. Prices have soared and the people are becoming money oriented. It is still a great place to visit with more freedoms to be yourself than at home in the USA, but this is changing with more safety issues, seat belts-helmets, dampening the feel the island once had. Civilization can be oppressive. We usually stay at an all inclusive but still eat at many of the eastside restaurants. I hope the hurricane Emily damage can be repaired and all the fine people we have met on the island are well.
