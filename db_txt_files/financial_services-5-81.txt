US Bank always does exactly what the policys dictate...if these people would bother to read there agreements or just check to make sure there deposits have cleared before writing checks like everyone knows is how it works you would not pay fee's. Not only that but they disclose all fees at time of opening and annually or in statements. US Bank is also right on par with all other major banks in fees. I am happy with their service 110%
