The Sprint PCS series is the best around, mostly because of its free and clear plan, which gives you voice mail, long distance, etc., all for free. It covers a large area, so that I can use my phone travelling back and forth from Davis to San Francisco. The only drawback is the small holes in the coverage area, which I ran into once, but they are few and far between.
