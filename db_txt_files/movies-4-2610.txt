Absolutely visually stunning. The Cell had my eyes so stimulated I forgot I was even in the movie theater. The concept is well thought out and exciting, but you feel like you should know some of the characters a little more than you do. The ending could have been made a bit easier to interpret as well. Overall though, this movie is definitely worth the price; you'll find yourself glued to the screen.
