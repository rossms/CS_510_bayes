I have had the Liberty for two years. I love the was it handles, especially in heavy snow. It has a lot of torque, but the horsepower could be increased to improve highway performance. It has a surprisingly comfortable ride on long trips, the only thing I would change is lumbar support in the driver and front passenger seats. P.S. Great warranty!
