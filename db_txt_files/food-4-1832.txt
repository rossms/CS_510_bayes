Runts are good because they're fun! Each flavour has a distinctive taste and is shaped in the fruit it represents. As far as I know, Runts are the only candy to do so. Also, the hard coating on the powder pellets make for a new texture which allows your tongue to stay intact and not become completely irritated by the dissolving powder as you eat them.
