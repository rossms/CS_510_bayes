I have a sister who speaks the native language in Mali, Bambara, who have lived in Mali in four months. She says it's a heaven of a country: Warm colourful people, amazing nature history a Lonely Planet traveller's paradise! What makes Mali most famous is the historical city Timbuktu, but it has much more to offer! I guess I have to visit it one day! :-D
