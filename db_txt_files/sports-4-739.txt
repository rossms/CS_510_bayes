He's declining, but still a 5-tool player. His swing is so smooth, so fluid, it hardly looks like he's trying and he tattoos the ball. He could hit for average at one point in the 90's, but I think those days are over. He can't hit .300 because he's become so obsessed with the long ball, with pulling it. With two strikes, he'll chase frequently. He still is a gold glove outfielder, he's still got the big arm, but I question his desire. He clearly isn't having fun out there.
