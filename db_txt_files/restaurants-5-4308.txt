By far my favorite restaurant. I've eaten at locations in New Jersey, NYC, and Cancun- they're great all over. I'm a huge fan of the NY strip. I just love how it's served on that sizzling plate dripping in butter and seasoning. Their appetizers are phenomenal as well. I recommend the shrimp ramolade, coconut shrimp, stuffed mushrooms- they're all great as well. On the side you can't go wrong with the huge baked potatos and spinach in cream sauce. I'm starving just thinking about it!
