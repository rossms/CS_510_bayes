5 stars for baked cheetos chrunchers! They are the best! They are so crisp, not greasy at all and the cheese flavour dominates all I guess I would give 3 or 4 stars to regular cheetos. I can;t say that I like or dislike them. I rarely have them and when I do I sway between like and dislike. Sometimes I'll have one and wont touch another again and other times I'll start an immediate addiction for about a week or 2 and then get sick of them again.
