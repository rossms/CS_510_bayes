Tom Daschle should be the majority leader. Trent Lott is ruining our country. I don't see who would vote for Republicans. They are all greedy. George Bush is really politicising the issue of Iraq. I mean, he tried to kill his daddy? Where did he get that? Tom D., you are the best thing that happened to this country since Lincoln!
