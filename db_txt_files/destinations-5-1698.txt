A great country to be in, taj mahal is awesome! A country full of sprituality, the more you try to unravel the more u get into. great coustoms traditions. One of the best climate. best places to visit are goa, rajastan, orissa bodh gaya(the birth place of buddha). Kerala is a must visit place with its exotic back waters don't leave bangalore, the silicon valley of the country , the place from where your calls get answered for citi, chase cards etc. Very friendly people but it's good to get a guide so that u can understand the stuff well. What u want more!
