I agree with sweetie1977.Iwork at a Farmer Jack and the employers are miserly with hours.They expect 8hours work in 4 to 6 hours.We are overworked and yes sometimes we find it hard to smile.Iused to look forward to coming to work.Now I just dread it.I won't even shop at Farmer Jacks.They already took 10% of my pay and 22 of my hours.They aren't getting anymore of my pay!!!
