I have been a dog owner and I am a dog lover, but I thought the film was making fun of all the other dog owners and lovers, so I found it very funny. I read somewhere that it was unscripted. Is this possible? Like Shroomwoman,I was a little disappointed not to see more of the dogs. However, although warned that it was slow, it was fast enough for me - a light and fun movie.
