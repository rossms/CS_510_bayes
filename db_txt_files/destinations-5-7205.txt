Lisbon is how I imagine Paris was before tourists discovered it... Riding around in the old trams is fantastic and the best way to see the city! Or go up to the castle of St George and enjoy the view, or wander through the Baixa looking at the shops. In the evening go to the Bairro Alto, listen to some traditional fado, visit lots of bars tucked up the side streets. This is a wonderful place.
