I enjoyed this movie when I first saw it, but now it kind of makes me queasy. Not because of the movie itself, but because of the people who think that if they talk in a hushed voice about what a powerful movie this is, it somehow makes them 'deep.' You know what? You're not deep - you're an idiot, and appreciating a movie's message doesn't change anything.
