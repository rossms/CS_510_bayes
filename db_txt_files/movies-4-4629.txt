I didn't care much for the books but I quite enjoyed this. Maybe it was Jim Carry's over-the-top performance, maybe it was the funny baby, maybe it was Jude Law's witty sense of humor but I thought it was simple but quite fun. Nothing extrodanary but even the fact that I enjoyed it was great for me. I probably enjoyed it more than the books.
