NFL Defensive Player of the Year. The Ravens have been the most successful team in the NFL draft over the last 10 years. Ed Reed is such a good player that the Ravens don't need to worry what to do after Ray Lewis retires. Ed Reed is already stepping up and not only dominating other teams' offenses, but becoming a vocal lead of ther Ravens team as well.
