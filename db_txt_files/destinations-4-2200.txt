The government here is very corrupt, and the cities are dangerous at night (Douala especially)- which makes Cameroun a challenge for the independent traveler BUT This African country has astounding natural beauty in places like Korup National Park, Mount Cameroon and Rhumsiki. Lush dense jungles with many birds and waterfalls can be found in the South with savanna in the north. Cameroon has remarkable cultural diversity. The small, colorful villages are much more appetizing than the cities.
