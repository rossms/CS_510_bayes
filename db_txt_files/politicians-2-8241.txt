If Mr. Kennedy had lived one can only guess what he might have accomplished. As it is, not very much. Outside of telling the Russian to get out of Cuba, he did fairly little, with the exception of seducing many women. Had he lived,he and Clinton would have had a lot in common. They were both skirt chasers .
