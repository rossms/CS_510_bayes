I've been using Schwab for the past three years and have definitely been very pleased with their service. Their site almost never goes down even during high trading volume. I think their prices for trades $30 for 1,000 shares or less is a little steep compared to other brokers who will let you trade up to 5,000 shares or more for only about $10 but I've heard from others that those sites aren't as reliable.
