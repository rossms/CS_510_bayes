Pistol Pete Maravich was the greatest player in NCAA history. If he had played with the right mix of talented players in the NBA when he was healthy, had the three-point rule, then he could have had some NBA rings. I had the honor of meeting Pistol Pete and his Dad at Kutsher's Basketball Camp, Monticello NY in 1969/1970. He was spectacular. He is definitely missed.
