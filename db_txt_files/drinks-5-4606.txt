What can one say about Coca-Cola. It's not only a great soft drink, but also an international institution as evidenced by its nearly universal market penetration and recognition. While sometimes I crave its primary rival Pepsi, most of the time there is no substitute when I have the option between the two (as Pepsi is usually just too sweet). Always cures what ails you. I have seen other comments reference New Coke, but I have not seen that in years. If memory serves, Coca-Cola is the most valuable brand-name and trademark in the world.
