Ricky Martin's debut album has its ups and downs. Salsa is one of the greatest forms of music ever created, and salsa dancing being one of the greatest pastimes. From that point of view Ricky Martin has talent (as long as he celebrates it in Spanish). The only downside is the fact he reminds me of my ex-boyfriend.
