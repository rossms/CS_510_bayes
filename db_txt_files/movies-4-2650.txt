This movie actually kick alot of ass. Much like this falls release, Joy Ride except face to face rather than through radio. A young man picks up the wrong hitchhiker and some of the coolest suspence/horror scenes insue. Rutgar Hauer is frightningly believable as the homocidal maniac stalking our hero. our hero has some really bad luck too. Jennifer Jason Lee puts in a noteable performance and it will just tear you intwo when you see what happens to her. Sick, Fun and creepy. The Hitcher is a great B movie.
