As a Phillies fan, I absolutely detest the Braves. That being said, I can't disagree with Twitchin' Monkey's comments. 14 straight division titles is a big deal - no luck involved. If it were any other team, I'd say this year was a fluke, with players who were on double-A teams earlier this season now hitting .330, but I just can't say that with the Braves. They have a formula that other teams (e.g. the Phillies) don't, and they always get it done.
