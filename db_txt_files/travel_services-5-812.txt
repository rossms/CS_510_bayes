The MBTA is an awesome transportation system it gets me everywhere I need to go every time. DO NOT believe those websites and people telling you its an awful system. It may have some bugs but that usually happens rarely. I'd reccomend you use it if you go to Boston. Besides it is not every day you visit Boston the city with the lowest fares on the subway.
