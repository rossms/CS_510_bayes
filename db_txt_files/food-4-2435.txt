Chocolate and Mint. Once again - so simple a combination yet so delicious. I'd like to try a milk chocolate version of it however it might turn out too sweet as yorks are already very sweet. I like that the peppermint is almost gooey yet not runny and the peppermint taste stays strong even though its pretty sweet.
