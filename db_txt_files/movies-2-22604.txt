I was actuately going to give this movie a 1 but felt generous today. I got my hopes up once I saw the adverts for this movie.....but the classical american way of making crap movies look good fooled me again. With stupid lines such as when Storm says 'Do you know what happens when a frog gets hit by lightning?.....the same thing that happens to everything else'.....what kind of a line is that? This must be one of the biggest movie losers of all century. The only highlight of this movie was seeing hugh jackman.
