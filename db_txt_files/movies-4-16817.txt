I liked this movie it was about these two guys who get in a traffic accident that changed their lives for the day after this lawyer looses an important file and the other guy picks it up so from then on it is about the lawyer who will do anything he can to get this file back but while doing so he is make the other guy even madder and ruining his life more and more. Anytime you started to feel sorry for the lawyer he does something wrong that makes you hope that he gets his. Good movie to watch when your in the mood to watch a movie.
