I enjoy Barnes and Noble. Both of the stores in our area are huge and have a good selection of books.They even have a lot of discount books to choose from.Both of the ones where we are at also have coffee shops attached so if one wishes to read and drink beverages they can. I really like their selection chances of finding a book you want is pretty good and if they do not have what you want, some of the books can be ordered.
