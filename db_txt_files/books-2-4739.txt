Great Expectations is a stumbling giant of a novel. Dickens was paid by the word and it shows. After a promising beginning, the plot is soon mired in redundancy and over-wordiness. Of the two endings, the original cynical and sad one was overruled by the publishers in favor of a sappy, sentimental happy ending to please the masses.
