Werther's Originals deserve the #1 place on this site, because they are the original candy. They are the first candies ever made I belive, and they put tons of work into making these I heard. You have to make the butterscoth and then the coating which is a hard caramel with chocolate flavoring, and it needs lots of corn syrup. Hopeufully, this review will bring it up to being #1.
