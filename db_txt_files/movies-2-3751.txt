Ok quirky movie in which all characters could be wiped out by an A-bomb and no one would care. Mel Gibson plays a criminal who plans to pull a heist, and in turn is double-crossed by his partner. He then spends the rest of the movie trying to get back his share of the money. Horrible plot holes in this movie.
