Lived here all my life and love it! And to the person who said the Braves SUCK. That was a dumb statement saying that the Braves are so arrogant then go on to say the Yankees are a million times better! LOL! You need to go and look at all the banners the Yankees have saying how many times they have been champs! Talk about arrogants! Dont talk about how much better they are either because they had the lead in the World Series with the Diamandbacks and put in their ACE Mariano Rivera and still LOST! HA!
