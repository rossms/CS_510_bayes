Anti-shock 40 seconds works perfectaly. Has a switch called hold . The hold switch will make all the buttons you press when it is in this mode not do anything. I bought my player at walmart for about $45, and the headphones sucked, but There are cheep little headphones all over the place. Aiwa makes great audio, and I think they will continue to untill perfection.
