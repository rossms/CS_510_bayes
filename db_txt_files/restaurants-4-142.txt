I love Starbucks in general but can we all have a reality check here - who determined that $3 is an acceptable price for a friggin' coffee?? Go to Miami where a 50 cent pick-me-up Cubano Coffee has twice the punch and taste. Again SB's is a great place - more of an experience than a true coffee shop
