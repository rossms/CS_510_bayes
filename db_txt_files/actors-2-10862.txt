Am I the only one who doesn't think Uma Thurman is beautiful? Don't get me wrong - if I saw her walking down the street I'd definitely do a double-take. But compared to other movie-hot actresses, she just doesn't cut it. Not even close. As an actress I think she's OK but nothing great. She did a good job in Beautiful Girls and I liked her in Pulp Fiction, but there's something about her that bugs me.
