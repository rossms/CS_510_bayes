I am so happy to see that Skor is on this list. I often think that Skor doesn't get enough credit since it is so similar to the Health Bar. I have always loved toffee and when you cover that with chocolate, it is so good. Health and Skor are basically the same candy bar but for some reason Skor is better. The toffee is more carmel tasting and the chocolate that covers isn't so thick.
