Its a great store...You might not always find what you are looking for, but they display a lot of clothing. It is a nice place to go shopping as a family, and they advertise for all ages, instead of targeting only children. Kid's clothes are great, and not pricy compared to other places. Some of their fashions are ugly, but when they get something right, its worth it.
