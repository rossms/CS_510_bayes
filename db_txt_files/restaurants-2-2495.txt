My dad calls this place Taco Puke or Taco S--- (he said he ate there once and ended up throwing his food away because it was so gross) and rightfully so. I tried it once and that was enough for me. The food was just nasty-tasting and not very good. The only decent thing they have is nachos, but other than that, I'd rather eat at Taco Bell, thank you. There's too many Taco Johns here in the Midwest- I wish they'd leave!
