Campbell's has too much salt. Why do these soup companies continue to add all those preservatives, added salt and other unnecessary ingredents. I'm aware that lots of people like lots of salt, don't mind MSG, etc. but I still suggest that the old soup companies like Campbell's at least add a natural foods line to their collection.
