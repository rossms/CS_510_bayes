I've had one for over four years and it's never given me a single problem. I have a whole home theater system (Denon receiver, Infinity speakers, Energy sub-woofer, Sony TV), and my JVC HR fits in perfectly. The picture quality is excellent and there are lots of great, easy-to-use features (one-touch recording, VCR+, cable box control, etc.). You don't hear a lot about JVC, but, based on my experience with this VCR, it's a great brand.
