Sh!t, who the hell can say that Jordan is bad? He is the all time number one NBA player. He is like...history. And how can u not give hime a five! There should be a ten for JORDAN. He's OUT OF THIS WORLD. He has the jump, the spin, the jam.... He is also a model for kids. He IS a role-model and the best basketball player of all time. P.S - dont mind the profanity
