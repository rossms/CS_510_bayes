Way overrated. If it wasn't for all the talent he got in the later part of his career when he got his super bowl wins, he wouldn't even be considered as a good quarterback. Even with the talent in the last 6 years of his career, career qb rating- 79.9...Brad Johnson had a higher qb rating than that, and was 1 off from John Elway's career high for touchdown passes last year, and Brad Johnson sucked last year...With that said, how can people still say John Elway was better than, or even in the same league with Joe Montana or Brett Favre?
