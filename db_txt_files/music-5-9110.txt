This is a WICKED song!! The video is really inspiring - I dont mean go and shave an old ladys head, but just to do what you want, when you want. I loved it when they trashed that brand new convertable by dropping it from a crane! And it does show Blink182s true personalitys - up for a laugh and having fun! Ok, so some people might say that they're being childish and immature, but who are they harming? It really makes me feel happy when I see it. Oh, and HOW fit does Mark wanna look? In a word, AWESOME.
