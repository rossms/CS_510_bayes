The resort I was at in Cancun during the New Year holidays 2001, Moon Palace Resort is the best. 5 plus stars and a whole lot to do in and around the resort. The airport is so modern and beautiful, and the staff anywhere you go are so friendly and outgoing. HI TO ENRIQUE AND OCTAVIO AT MOON PALACE RESORT.
