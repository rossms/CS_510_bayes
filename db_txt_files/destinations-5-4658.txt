Some of these responses are laughable. You holier-than-thou snobs claim to be so cultured but it's obvious you have no sense of exploration. St. Louis is an amazingly interesting, cultured, and historic city full of treasures originality. Just because you're from LA or Chicago or [insert "hip" city] doesn't automatically give you good taste, nor does it make you an authority on all things urban. Get out and explore you predictable bores. If you actually venture off of the highways you'll find some of the country's finest neighborhoods and colorful people.
