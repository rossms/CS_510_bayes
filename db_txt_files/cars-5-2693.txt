For $55,000 you could buy a truly competitive race car, be it on the strip or the track. This car is scorchingly fast, and handles very well also. A broad powerband and healthy torque on tap make it almost scary to drive hard in, thats how fast this Mustang is! You know that big spoiler on the back? Unlike your neighbors hopped up Civics spoiler, this wing actually helps keep the Cobra Rs rear wheels planted at high speeds. This is one sweet machine.
