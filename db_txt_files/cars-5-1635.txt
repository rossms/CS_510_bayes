Virtually of the problems with the Alero were corrected by the 2000 model year, as evidenced by the good reliabilty rating given to the Alero by Consumer Reports. I own a new 2001 GL1 V6 Sedan. The powertrain is incredible--very smooth and lots of power and especially torque. Fuel economy has been excellent so far. The 200 watt sound system is top notch, and the handling is crisp and well mannered. Braking is also above average. The rear seat can be a bit tight, but there is plenty of room in the front. This car also looks fantastic.
