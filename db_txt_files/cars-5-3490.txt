Great buy! Wanted to buy a Accord EX-V6. But when I drove the HL, I never looked back. Basically got the same payment as the Accord and a great price too! Also being a Toyota Encore customer helps! You do not have to post a security deposit and you also get a better leasing/financing rate...things you can never negotiate!!! Excellent vehicle...great mileage for its class...Toyota quality....overall great experience. RS
