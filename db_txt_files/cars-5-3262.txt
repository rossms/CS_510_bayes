My wife and I both own his and hers 2002 Jeep Liberties. I have 22,000 miles on mine,she has 13,000 miles on hers. We have not had any problems with either one. These vehicles are well built and solid. They will go anywhere. My liberty tows my bass boat better that my Ford F150 pickuptruck did. I can hardly tell that I am towing a boat. The only complaint that I have is that the gas mileage is not the best. You can not go wrong for the price of this vehicle. a Ford Escape does not come close to what this vehicle can do. The Xterra needs to be turbocharged to get the same power as the Jeep.
