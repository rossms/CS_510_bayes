If you are a Syracuse fan (which I am) you'd know that it was Gerry McNamara that made the team win. It's true that Carmelo was awesome but Gerry put everything he had into every minute he played. He gave the team energy and he made them play better. Hopefully, next season he'll do the same and the cuse will win again.
