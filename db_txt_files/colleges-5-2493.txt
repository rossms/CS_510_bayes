You will love this school. Like many that attend here, I had offers from much more prestigious universities. I chose this one because of its absolutely unique atmosphere. There is a fairly strict honor code, but if it's in accordance with your beliefs, this is one of the most fun places to spend four years. You will, however, be ready to move on after that. The school gets enough respect to get you into the top grad schools if you do well, but has a low tuition and few snobs, making it a very attractive alternative to more elitist programs.
