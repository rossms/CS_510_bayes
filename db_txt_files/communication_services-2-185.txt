Their tech support and customer service is terrible. They bill two months late for minutes used outside your home area. On the few occasions that I've had to contact tech support, it involved more than one call to finally get a tech on the line that i could understand and who was able to resolve the problem. The only thing I'll give them is that they've got a pretty decent coverage area, but if you ever have a problem with billing or a technical problem, GOOD LUCK!
