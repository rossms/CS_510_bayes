Very reliable. I have a '94 SL2 with over 127,000 miles on it. The only work I have had done, besides regular maintenance, was some stupid emissions stuff that had nothing to do with it actually running. It still looks good and I hope to keep it for a couple more years. No alternator problems. I do occassionally have to add some oil between changes, but so what.
