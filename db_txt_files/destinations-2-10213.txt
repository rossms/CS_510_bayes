These effect me the same way any menthol does: major headache. Not to mention getting light-headed trying to get ANYTHING from them. Too mild for me. I need taste WITH my cancer-sticks. Otherwise, they're just cancer-sticks/slow suicide. Might as well enjoy the drug while killing me softly...er...slowly. (ooo, bad crappy song reference) Boring much?
