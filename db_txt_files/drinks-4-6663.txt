They should have never discontinued the Starfruit flavor, that was the best ever. I guess the Xtremo flavors are the best they have now, but I take offense when they say they designed Xtremo for latino athletes. Why don't they just say they designed them for human athletes who appreciate good tasting fruit flavored sport drinks and drop all the ethnic appeal BS.
