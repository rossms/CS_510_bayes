The best FPS game ever. Being on the same level as Rainbow Six, a stealth and discetion, Thief is far more intelligent than Rainbow 6. It is based on going undetected, rather than silent sniping and killing. Also the engine renders really greatly light and sound effects. This game is about being a thief, not another stupid and boring killing-machine who enjoy spilling more and more blood all-over the ground. Also, the dark medieval style of the game rocks.
