I am sure the Twins will repeat the AL Central again in 03. Cleveland is done, Chicago's improvements are good, but not great. KC and Detroit are not even a threat, so it looks like everything is OK. As for Selig wanting to contract the Twins. The reason is because he wants the upper Midwest baseball fans to head to Milwaukee to root for his daughters useless Brewers. I would rather go to Chicago, KC or St Louis than going to that disposable stadium in Milwaukee.
