The general banking center is NOT helpful. (The 800 number) I actually had a telephone customper representative tell me that my account was not important to them!!! However, when I went to close my account, I met the branch manager, and was favorably impressed. I have since developed a relationship with the branch, and have realized my LOCAL BOA bank is great! Just don't deal with the general #. It makes me wonder why BOA spends so much money on advertising to generate goodwill, and then has those awful people dealing with callers.
