I think it was Robin Williams who said, it's the world's largest minature golf course. Its an interesting place to visit but I am not sure if I would want to live there. Lots to see and do, and its also one of the best places to people watch. You will think your at the U.N. because you hear so many languages. Great place to vacation so long as you like gambling and having porno ads shoved in your face.
