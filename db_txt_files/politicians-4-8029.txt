I give FDR a 4 because of his handling of WWII...he wasn't afraid to take chances...did what had to be done...on the domestic front...a little too liberal for me...and trying to pack the Supreme Court with his own supporters was not a good thing...I also feel that he had no buisiness running for that fourth term...
