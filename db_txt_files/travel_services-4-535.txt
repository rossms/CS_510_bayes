Went through this airport several times and never had a bad experience. . .it's very clean. NICE CUSTOMS OFFICIALS! L.A.X. customs is awful but the Chicago customs officials were some of the nicest I've ever met. Although the airport is huge, I've never had a hard time finding anything. Probably one of my favorite airports in America.
