Whenever I'm thirsty, drowsy, or depleted of energy, I make a large cup of Tetley tea, pour it down my throat, and am instantly reinvigorated by the refreshing drink. I usually drink around 3-4 cups of Tetley every day and it really keeps me bright and keen. It's tasty too and it's not too strong or too mild. Finally, the price is reasonable. Tetley is on par with the more expensive Twinings speciality teas and beats those tasteless American labels (Bigelow, Stash, etc.) anytime. By the way, I drink tea hot and with a few drops of milk.
