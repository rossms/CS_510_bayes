As an adult watching this, it was pretty good--the animation is great, a little on the dark side, but pretty cool. It's about a widow mouse mother trying to save her little son, who has pnemonia and can't be moved out of his home, but the home is threatened by the yearly plowing of the soil on the farm on which they live, and about the rats of NIMH. I would recommend this for children, but some people might have a problem with a mouse saying the word damn , but honestly it's not that big a deal.
