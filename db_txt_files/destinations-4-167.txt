The people are really nice when you actually communicate with them, preferably in Chinese. The food is varied and fabulous, and there are lots of interesting sites around the city (if you avoid the tourist traps, that is). Shopping is great fun, and you can find some increadible bargins, especially if you speak Chinese. The city has really shaped up over the last year. The high pollution levels, bad traffic, and the constant spitting ;-) detracts from what otherwise would be a very nice place to live in and to visit.
