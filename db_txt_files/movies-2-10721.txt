Okay irish, I have to admit I'm with you on 99.9% of it. But, for some reason; blame it on the phases of the moon or the fact that I was so elated because the day I watched it happened to be the TGIFriday of a particularly nasty week - but Rip Torn just cracked me up in this. So sick yet, a couple of lines almost put me in the floor. Still, it was over the top and under the IQ deficit to the max.
