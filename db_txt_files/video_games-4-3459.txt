FF8 is a fairly good game. Although many were disappointed with it, I know many people who think it is better than FF7. The FMVs are among the most beautiful graphics I have ever seen, especially the ending. The characters are cool too. Some of the music is really awesome, but a lot of the music is stupid. In my opinion, the story isn't as good as FF7, and I didn't like it nearly as much, but it's still a very good game.
