You have to enjoy well-done films, and this was a good one; just enough exposition for those who hadn't read the book, solid casting throughout, and a nice pace that caused neither snores nor nosebleeds. The monster animation left a little to be desired, but the other special effects were nailed with a fair degree of ingenuity. Should be plenty watchable over the next couple of decades.
