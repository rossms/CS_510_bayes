Burger King is pretty darn awesome, but only for us lucky stiffs up here in Canada. I can sum up our BK advantage is one word: Poutine. For you poor yanks not in the know, poutine is fries covered in cheese curds with gravy poured over them. And BK uses a GREAT tasting gravy. A chicken sandwich meal with poutine subbing for the fries...you can't get much better than that. One little niggle is the twisted mayo they put on the chicken sandwich...it's the colour and consistancy of snot. Not exactly condusive to the appetite.
