Scrabble is one of the best games ever and my absolute favorite. If I could have one game on a desert island, or Survivor!- it would definately be Scrabble. The game is never the same twice and its a challenge to make your letters count for the most points each time. Its thrilling to know if you put your z on a triple letter score , it's 30 points right there. Scrabble is great with family or even on a date - just add wine and a fireplace. I am going to splurge and finally buy myself the deluxe addition for my birthday this year.
