This is a great game. The lighting effects and driving intracacies of each car are exceptionally good. To beat the game, however, takes a ton of gaming time, which I dont have the attention span for. This can be a good thing, however, showing that the producers put a lot of thought into the game. The only major bone I have to pick with this third rendition of the game is this: What happened to the racing modifictaion where you could get the cars all painted up with sponsors and aero packages and all that stuff? That was a really great part of the game. Oh well, there's always GT4.
