One of the few movies I have seen in a theater more than once, Bandits is a well made and entertaining movie. Just when you thought there was nothing new on the bank robbery front along comes this flick. Bruce Willis and Billy Bob Thornton team together well, but most surprising was the role of Bruce Willis's cousin, who is phenomenal. Slightly dissapointing was Cate Blanchet, but this does not detract from the movie. Also honorable mention nust go to the host of the show Criminals at Large . Defintiely a must see.
