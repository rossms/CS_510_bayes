As an adult, I can still relate to this wonderful story about a little boy having a rotten day. It is told in a very simple yet realistic way, including lots of situations children (and adults!) can relate to- being left out, not getting your way, and being blamed for something that's not your fault. The repetition draws you in, and the illustrations add a lot to the story. This is a classic for all ages.
