I spent a month traveling in Romania. Brasov IS beautiful with a lovely town center. Friendly people everywhere. Cool restaurants. But, please avoid The Capitol Hotel. It is pricey & far from the 3-star rating it boasts. I also heard that Brasov recently (brutally) exterminated all their stray dogs to clean up the streets and attract more tourists. I was incredibly saddened to hear this but it would make sense that this is 100% true since the rest of the country clearly has a major stray dog problem. :(
