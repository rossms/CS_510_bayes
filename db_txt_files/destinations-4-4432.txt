Gotta give credit where credit is due. Last July I spent a week in Indianapolis. I wasn't too thrilled about going there but when I left I had a totally different opinion. Maybe I was just lucky but some of the friendliest people I've ever met were in Indianapolis. I especially remember the young kids at the McDonalds just down the street from my hotel. Nice town, great people.
