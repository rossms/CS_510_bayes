Honestly, this is the best stuff! I believe that I have acquired a taste for hard alcohol and nothing, nothing, compares to the strength yet smooth taste of Tanqueray. It effects me more strongly than others. It is great to drink straight because it has a smooth unique taste. It also mixes particularly well with such beverages as 7up, and cranberry juice, but I guess that's just standard fare. This is my favorite.
