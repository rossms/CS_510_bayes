As a huge Q.T. fan I was a little disapointed.The first part of the movie dealing with on the run criminals who kidnap a former preacher and his kids to use them as hostages to cross the border is a bit boring.Once the scene shifts to the Titty Twister bar the action takes off.The action inside the bar reminds me of Dennis Miller's Bordello of Blood. A good movie but a let down to Rodriquez fans and Quentin fans.
