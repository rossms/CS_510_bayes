Austin's a very nice, underrated city in Central Texas. The atmosphere of the place is great. There are many nice restaurants and a good nightlife because of the University of Texas (a really good college). It's kind of near ranch country so you could go see a working ranch as a daytrip from the city. The surroundings are really nice and I bet it would be a great city to live in. Plenty of culture, always something to do and a comfortable setting makes it ideal.
