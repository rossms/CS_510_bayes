Pistol Pete is the greatest scorer in college basketball history. His scoring averages for his three seasons at LSU (freshman didn't play back then) are the top 3 of all time and will never be broken. He averaged around 44 points/game for his college career. Now, it is news if a player scores 40 in one game.
