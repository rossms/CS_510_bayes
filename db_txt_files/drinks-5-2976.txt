XS is the only energy drink I hqave found that tastes great! All the rest taste like some form of cough syrup. XS is also great because there is NO SUGAR! and NO CARBS! Its loaded with Vitamin B12=4900%. So your energy is low key. You dont get that sugar high and then crash from all the insulin produced in your body from the sugar. But XS is privately sold. And I hear you can franchise it out for almost no money.
