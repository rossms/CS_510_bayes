LOL! Viper?! Dodge?! Hold up.....ahahahahahahah! K now for some reason I think Cage_rules was actually trying to match Dodge in the same category as Ferrari....Oh he was....hahahahaha.Too funny.No seriously Ferrari is the best in the world and they will always be the best in the world.You take your cool 800 horsepower Viper and put it on a test track against a real horse, and were talking about the Ferrari F-50, and see if your car can even finish the race let alone beat the best car in the world.
