Out of Africa is a great, classic movie. Classic in the sense of its date, and the leading stars. I enjoy movies that take me to other lands, and this movie made me share in that experience. The portrayal of the indigenous people I thought was very good. I often forget this film was a love story, so I guess that is a good thing.
