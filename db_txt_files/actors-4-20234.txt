Ahhh, a perennial MooCow favorite, Helen Hunt nearly always manages to make it into the list of Top 20 Snugglebunnies. The MooCow thinks she is a marvelous actress who always commands the audience's sympathy. She is blessed with dazzling beauty, a sharp wit, and a professional moxie that has come from working many years in a rapacious business. The MooCow has nut'n but respect for Ms. Hunt, and the whole herd eagerly awaits her next creative venture. :=8)
