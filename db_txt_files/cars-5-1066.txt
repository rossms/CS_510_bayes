Recently purchased a 2001 Anniversary Edition 5 sp. and have nothing but the highest of praise for this vehicle. Tremendously powerful and flexible engine - lots of torque down low. Very nice shifter and light clutch - not a problem in heavy traffic. Great handling with very flat cornering. Spacious and luxurious interior. Others considered: Lexus IS300 (no stick, much slower than claimed); Acura Cl-S (very fast, much too big and heavy for a sporting coupe, no stick); Audi A4 (love the 4wd, hate the floppy shifter, very small back seat) BMW 3 series (great car, not a great value).
