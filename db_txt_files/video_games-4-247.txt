An excellent title. It's immersive, due to the highly technical car set-up options and the realistic practice and qualifying rounds before races. It is also very realistic in terms of physics, except for the propensity of the car to lose rear-end traction when you go on the apron. Another drawback is the lack of Formula One licences, but it is easily rectified by editing the teams and drivers. In fact, the car color schemes were perfect to the 2001 season's teams. Simply put, this is a great simulation for fans of realistic F1 racing.
