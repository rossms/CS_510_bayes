Talk about a team on the rise! Sure, they barely missed the playoffs, but the way they played the end of the season and even some early in the season was impressive. This was a bad year to be in the AFC, though... The Chiefs went 10-6 and missed the playoffs... Pretty unfortunate for the 9-7 Dolphins as well. Everything looks like it's all heading in the right direction for this team, except maybe their defense. The defense played well, but they also are getting older. Nick Saban is a genius. Next year might be their year for a division championship...
