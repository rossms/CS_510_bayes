I saw this movie when it came out in the theatres and liked it wuite a bit. I am always pretty interested in movies that deal with the occult/mysticism/ history of religion. Granted, a lot of this plot was fictional, it does make you wonder what types of religious mysteries exist. It was a little fraphic as far as the blood goes, so the squeamish may be turned off.
