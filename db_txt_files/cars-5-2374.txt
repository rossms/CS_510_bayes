This is one of the best cars that was ever made. liddlebopeep you have no clue what you are saying. Poor gas mileage and a harsh ride? Have you ever been in a Viper?!?! Only someone who actually has been in the passenger seat of a car like that or has had the luck to get behind the wheel can say things like that. Not someone who is just saying it because they are jelous that others know stuff about cars and she dosent!
