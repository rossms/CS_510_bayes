My Navigator completes me as a person...I used to think I owned the road...Now I do; My Black Lincoln Navigator is very roomy and very confortable...I drive 100 miles per day; and it's like sitting in my living room. It's the best; and yes, everyone that see me on the road - knows that I drive the best!!!
