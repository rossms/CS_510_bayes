What can I say about New Orleans... Great city, great food, great nightlife (in the French Quarters), friendly people, and an interesting history behind it all. However the city is dirty...the streets smell like pee and vomit. Don't get me wrong though, I love New Orleans. I've visited New Orleans, well the French Quarters, about every years since 1998. I know there's probably more to New Orleans besides the French Quarters... It's a great place to go if you want to get drunk for cheap (they run 3-for-1 drink specials) and see lots of boobs and debauchery.
