To tell the truth, I don't remember much about the airport facilities themselves (landed there in 1968, military charter flight, so didn't really spend any time at the terminal). However, what I do remember is that I thought the pilot had decided to land on a narrow city street instead of on a real runway -Kai Tak is flanked by apartment building that seem perilously close to the edge of the runway. I guess we're still talking about the same airport.
