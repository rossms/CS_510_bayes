This is a very good phone which is light and easy to use. One of the bad parts is that the battery life is not long enough. The phone has a side holder which is very convienient. It has a vibrator for silent use. It also has a light that constantly blinks green if you have a good connection, yellow if you are roaming, and red is no service.
