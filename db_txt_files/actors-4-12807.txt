The MooCow has seen CAM in only 4 films: The Matrix, Chocolat, Red Planet, and Memento, and in each film she was absolutely marvelous. She has a beautiful face, looks dead sexy in tight black leather pants(yowza!)and shades, and has demonstrated a remarkable range of ability to back up her snugglosity. If they ever made a live-actor version of Aeon Flux (you old MTV heads out there know what I mean), Ms. Moss would be the perfect actor to carry the part. She blows Angelina Jolie away in that reguard. The MooCOw can't wait to see Ms. Moss in udder new films!
