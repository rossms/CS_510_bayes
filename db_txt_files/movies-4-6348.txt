A real funny movie. Dustin Hoffman is a young man just graduated from college who is seduced into an affair with a middle aged woman who is a friend of the family. Anne Bancroft is good as Mrs. Robinson and so is Dustin Hoffman as Ben. the movie has it's twist when Ben ends up liking Mrs. Robinsons daughter istead The very ending is good.It also has a very good soundtrack with songs from Simon and Garfunkel.
