Ad-Aware seems to be the standard and (as the other comments noted) it is free. Nevertheless, though perhaps its just my computer, but the program sometimes hangs and doesn't finish the cleanup. Moreover, when I was attempting my first scan, I had to first use a competing product (name now forgotten) to get Ad-Aware to work. However, there have been no lingering problems since that first time.
