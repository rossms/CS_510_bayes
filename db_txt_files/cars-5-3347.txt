I look pretty fly in my 2000 Grand Cherokee. A guy I know bought a Ford Explorer before I obtained my Jeep, and he now suffers from Cherokee Envy. Much more comfortable than other mid-size SUV's, with room to spare. The V-6 engine in my Laredo model provides outstanding power and performance. Overall, an excellent buy from the people who invented and perfected the SUV.
