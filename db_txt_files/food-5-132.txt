Good cereal. Another one the whole family is willing to eat.this is important to me as the grocery shopper since cereal can be expensive. I love the fact it is plain on one side and sweetened on the other. It gives it just the right amount of sweetness to me.the small size is nice so you do not have to break it up with a spoon. Just pop it in your mouth.
