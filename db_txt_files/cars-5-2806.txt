I have owned two RX-7's (1st and 2nd gens) and they've both been incredible cars. Next up on my list is a 3rd gen. They are misunderstood because most people do not realize what they are .. a world class SPORTS CAR .. not a sporty car or GT Car (ie Supra) .. but a Sports Car : light weight, high power, incredible handling.
