A really cool cd for multi-age parties. and it has solid tracks like quit playing game with my heart and as long as you love me which are good track to listen to when your cruising dowon the freeway and your trip just started out. the songs are softly groovy and have that feel that I like in a dance cd, classic club/semi-hip-hop feel I like the feel of the track hey mr dj! it's a good party jam.
