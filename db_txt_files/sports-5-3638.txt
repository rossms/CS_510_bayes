Willie Stargell of the Pittsburgh Pirates (1962 - 1982) had an intimidating presence between the lines and charismatic patriarch in clubhouse and dogout. Crushed 475 homers, many of tape-measure variety and hit most by any player during the 1970's. Like his round-trippers, his 1,540 RBI's also most ever by a Pirate. Batted .282 over 21 seasons, all with Pittsburgh. Shared N.L. MVP honors in 1979, and named MVP in 79 N.L. championship series and World Series.
