Zook has put together a very highly repeced coaching staff and is an excelent recruiter. He has bn let down by his ofensive and defensive choices who show that they are unable to fiish off an opponent. He dosent have the sense of going for the juglar like Spurrier. He will after this week. Look for him to go all the way undefeated.
