I've enjoyed every visit to the roadhouse. The waitresses are always pretty and sweet, almost scored a couple of times in that area. The food is predictably spot on every time and even if its not they'll do what they can to put it right. My nuts are to precious to throw on the floor. Probably just $ or 2 over priced but i always grab my coat if someone offers ;)
