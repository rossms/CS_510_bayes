Just realized some didn't find me SARCASTICALLY! calling Sean fat funny. I love Sean. Great low post scorer. Perhaps only matched by Marvin Williams as a rebounder in the conference. And he is running the floor as well, if not better than anyone on the team. I see Luke Schensher in particular, not enjoying that aspect of the Carolina - GA Tech game. He looks like a giraffe running in slow motion.
