Thi song is the best new song I've heard so far. The lyrics were (unfortunately) heartbreakingly true and the fact that it offers both sides of the argument makes the song even more emotional. Yes, it was difficult to listen to, but SOMEONE needed to say the words that were in that song and I'm glad City High said it so nicely
