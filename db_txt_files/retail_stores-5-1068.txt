So, what's wrong with a little romance? Laura Ashley clothing is light, airy and casually elegant. The colors and prints are soft and relaxing. They remind me of the English countryside and bright Easter mornings. There's something very gently kind about them. Sure, they're not something you'd want to wear all the time any more than you would want to read Jane Austen everyday. But every now and then it's kind of nice and even a bit uplifting.
