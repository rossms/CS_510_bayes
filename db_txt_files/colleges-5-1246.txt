an absolutely amazing school. the Core is actually extremely useful, provided you get a good professor. the location, of course, is one of the top reasons to choose Columbia. sports suck though. the classes are often hard, but grade inflation always helps. very liberal, very diverse, and overall definitely a top 5 university.
