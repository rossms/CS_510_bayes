Duke is a good time. Contrary to the nimrod opinions put forth by several posters, not all Duke students study endlessly. Everyone here is concerned about their grades, but most don't really bare down until midterms/exams/papers are coming up. In between, fun stuff can be found quite easily. Durham is s slight negative but it isn't nearly as bad as its image. All in all, I've had a great 3 years here so far...
