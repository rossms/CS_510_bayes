I never knew too much about this crotchety old bugger until recently. His temper tantrums are hilarious. His disallowing the oil execs. from having to sware under oath recently was not handled very well. Afterall if they have nothing to hide (which I suspect may be the case) there should not be any problem. Was it Twain that said "If you always tell the truth you don't have to remember anything?" Try listening to this guy give a speech too. His voice cuts off abrubtly about every 2.3 seconds. Very difficult to listen to.
