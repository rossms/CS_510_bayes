Neil's best album. Cowgirl in the Sand, Down by the River (it's evil twin) and Cinnamon Girl. Great jam songs made for anyone's garage band. An awkward guy making awkward music for an awkward world. The cool thing is; he sounds just as bad as us! And you've got to love a guy for that. Long live Crazy Horse!!!
