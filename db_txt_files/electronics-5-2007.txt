The n-gage qd is awsome just picked one up.It is a big improvement over the first one.The QD is what should have came out in the first place.Dont get me wrong the first one was fine but I have to say the qd is for gamers.I believe once the people start to try it out it will sell.It has got nothing but good reviews and with games like ghost recon,call of duty and rally sport it should start to pick up.So before you bad mouth it try it cause it crushes the gba in everyway.
