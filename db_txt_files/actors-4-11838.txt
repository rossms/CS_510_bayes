Angelina Jolie is... her own rumor mill. Not only can she act and looks more like a cyborg than a woman -- don't scoff, this is the stuff of stardom, look at Michael Jackson -- but she has perfected the art of creating, building, and attracting all kinds of wacky scandalous gossip about herself for the easily duped public to be, well, shocked and turned on by. She's smart. I like her. Go Anjelina!
