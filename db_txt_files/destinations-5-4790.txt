Fabulous place. While there, there are several musts: (1) hang-glide over the city, (2) take a helicopter ride around the Jesus statue on Corcovado from Pao de Acucar, (3) do the favela tour of Rocinha, (4) have brunch at the Copacabana Palace - even better would be staying there, and of course, (5) lounge all day at the beach.
