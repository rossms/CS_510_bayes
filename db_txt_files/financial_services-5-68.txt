I have been with USbank for a long time... and I have a checking, savings and credit card with them. Everytime I have had a problem they have been quick to resolve it. I am a customer service rep myself, and I am always impressed with how friendly Usbank's reps are. Their credit card rates are competitive and they value thier existing customers as much as the new ones they try to recruit. I would recommend this bank anytime.
