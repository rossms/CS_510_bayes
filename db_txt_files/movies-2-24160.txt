Everyone told me to watch that movie. So I watched it on DVD. And I was disappointed. Bruce Willis and Ben Affleck sucked. Sorry for being rude, but that is how I felt. I felt like they played themselfs and not the character. The story was interessting but I was bored out of my mind. Liv Tyler did a good job, I am impressed with her as an actress.
