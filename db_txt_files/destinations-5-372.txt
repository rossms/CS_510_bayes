I love Alberta. Yes, okay, some people in Calgary can suck. But not everyone and besides, it's got tons to see (especially if you come during Stampede). Edmonton is beautiful too, plus we have Banff and Drumheller. I'm not saying we're the best province, but we're not horrible. And while we have a lot of prairie, we're not Oklamhoma North--that's Saskatchewan. What is there in Saskatchewan?
