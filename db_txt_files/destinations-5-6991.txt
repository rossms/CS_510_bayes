London has always had a rich heritage. Throughout its history, London has managed to survive. Through bombing raids by the Luftwaffe during World War II, London has embodied the resolute spirit of Sir Winston Churchill. It's just amazing to me that a city such as London seems to strike a balance between the new and old. And perhaps because of this, it has again won the right to host the 2012 Summer Olympics. But there is no doubt it is a great city.
