The childrens clothes are cheap and very in style. I don't have to worry about paying an arm and a leg when I shop thier. My kids grow out of things so quickly so that is a bitch of mine, that they grow out of things to quick. I buy a lot of my summer things thier too. Very cheap and the quality is pretty good too. I don't mind paying $20 for a pay of shorts when the same style, different brand , is $45 at a major dept store.
