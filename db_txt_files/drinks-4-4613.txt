Of course, a soft drink is not good for you by any means. That's a given. However, Coca-cola is the best tasting of the cola brand drinks. It may give you a little gas afterwards. Find me a cola drink that doesn't though. Coke is also a good remedy for upset stomaches and sea sickness. Seriously, if you start to feel weak out at sea, drinking some coke wil temporarely settle your stomach.
