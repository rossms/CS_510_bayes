My family has moved two times. The first time it was a complete moving out and the second was just helping my sister to move to her new apartment. Both times, renting a U-haul was very convenient. I like the deal price to rent a big truck or van for $20. Of course including miles, gas and insurance (if you need one) the cost goes up. But, I chose to use U-hauls because they are available everywhere.
