This is the vodka you drink freshman year of college to feel refined. After you turn 21 and you can buy your own liquor, it's time for an upgrade. About the same quality as Smirnov, but with a higher price tag. Burning after-taste when sampled at room temperature, but it does fairly well when chilled and in mixed drinks. Bottom line: you can do better.
