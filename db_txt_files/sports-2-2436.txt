While the Royals may start out O.K. I would expect them to have serious problems with their pitching staff that should show up by the second half of the season. Juan Gonzalez, Matt Stairs, and Benito Santiago were added in the offseason. K.C. should have shopped around for a dominant pitcher. Fourth place in the A.L.Central
