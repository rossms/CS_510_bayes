I have to admit that White Chocolate isn't all that great of a shot. He only averages, like, 15 PPG but he is still an excellent ball player. He's no Michael Jordan but I would definately want him on my team and would be proud to coach a player like that. You need some razzle dazzle in the game and he is the man to look at!! J-Wil is one of my favorite players and he deserves more positive recognition.
