Definitely disagree with a previous reviewer who couldn't imagine reading it more than once -- I've read it a number of times, and get more out of it each time. Marion Zimmer Bradley has written some excellent books, both before and since, Mists of Avalon, but I suspect this will be the one she's remembered for. Is she the first to write Arthur's tale from the point of view of one of the female characters? Probably a first to show Arthur and the many other characters as human and fallible. Of all the many versions of the Arthurian legend that I've read, this remains my favourite.
