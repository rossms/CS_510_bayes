Allen Iverson is a great player, but as long as kobe is in the league he will always be second best. But that obvious.And for the guy who said that kobe sucks, and that loves iverson so much. I respect your opinion but look at the stats and the ring does iverson have those, NOPE. And also there is a lot more that just a good crossover. Oh yeah one more thing, record sales don't win NBA championships
