I bought a used 99 jetta in two weeks ago in Nov 2004. I love the car, I felt it mimiked the 300 series of BMW without spending the extra money. However, I do have a problem already. The car's polarity is giving me difficulty and I cannot receive AM stations and have static on my XM satellite also. Anyone with any ideas how to fix this?
