Known mostly for their wonderful pancakes, this family resturant has alot more to offer, unfortunatly. The rest of the menu is tasty, but not remarkable in any way. The chain seems to be highly popular, especially in morning, often resulting in long waits for tables. They have made the ordinary pancake something to look forward to. They offer a wide range of syrups to fit almost every taste. A good resturant, not a spectacular one.
