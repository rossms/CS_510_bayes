the tastiest of the after dinner mints! delicious dark chocolate on the outside and cool white mint inside, and they're so soft. they just melt in your mouth when i bite into a york peppermint pattie, i get the sensation SIKE...but i do like 'em and i like that commercial where the little old bald guy says he's just glad he gets a sensation!!
