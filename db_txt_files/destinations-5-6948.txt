I agree with bmcmul - Glasgow beats Edinburgh hands down. The people are friendlier, the pubs are better, and the football teams are vastly superior. Glasgow's image as a dirty old industrial city are completely outdated. The city is the best in Scotland, and probably one of the top three in Britain.
