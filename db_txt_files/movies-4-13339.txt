I think what stayed with me most about this movie was not the good acting - and there was plenty of that - but the chillingly realistic, and often graphic depiction of war time violence. The opening scene in which the allies land on Normandy is shocking. The video clip style makes it seems like you are watching actual war footage, and there is plenty of gore. And if that didn't phase you, the hand to hand combat scenes a little later will. This movie is a weird example of a movie whose effects are so realistic that it actually makes the movie less enjoyable.
