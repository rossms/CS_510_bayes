this is a great product.I have tried both flavors and they are awseome.We first tried them when we were given free samples at the Seattle Seafair hydro races.Found them at our local safeway store.I hope the fred meyer will have them soon.I requested them.You need to try these.Great for the kid;s lunch box.I like them for a quick snack during work.Please make some more flavors.....
