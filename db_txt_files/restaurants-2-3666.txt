Domino's gets 2 stars for being speedy. Other than the quick service you normally get at Domino's, the rest of it is very below average. The sauce, the dough, all of it is just really bland. Depending on which Domino's you are going to, the prices can be outrageous to very economical. It just depends on how hungry and how big of a hurry you are in I guess. I usually prefer eating at Pizza Hut over this place.
