Like Snoopy I'm not a fan of W G, but I agree this guy is definitely the standout on that show. Lots of energy and extremely funny. His wacky portrayal of Jack sometimes puts me in the mind of an early Daffy Duck...woohoo woohoo! I would be interested to see what he might do with other roles as well.
