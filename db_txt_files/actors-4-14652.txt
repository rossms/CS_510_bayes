I love Courtney Love.. but I must admit, she isnt the best actress... The People VS Larry Flint she was great in - but then her character wasnt really a far stretch from her real life was it? Only thing is that she had to be striaght while making that movie.. had weekly drug tests and everything - so I *guess* she was acting... hehehe I liked Man On The Moon too - but she didnt really have many lines...
