I've always though Domino's had pretty good pizza- it was what we usually ordered if we got pizza. But I ordered from them a month or so ago and the pizza was not very hot by the time they got it to me(it also took close to 45 minutes - what happened to their deal of having it to you in 30 minutes or less?) Plus I'd ordered that cheesy bread they recently offered and I was disappointed. It looked nothing like the stuff on the TV ads. It didn't have enough cheese and it was very hard to pull apart. But overall I still think Domino's is fairly decent. Maybe I'll give them another chance.
