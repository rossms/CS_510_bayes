If you look at America before President Clinton, during his terms in office, and after his Presidency it seems to me we were better off with him in the whitehouse. The unemployment level was an all time record low, the budget was balanced, we had better relations with the rest of the world, crime dropped, the environment was spared, consumer confidence soared and the stock market trippled. I am not saying he was a great husband, but he was an excellant President.
