This is a very reputable b-school. In my opinion, this is better than Harvard in the U.S.. If I have the talent, intellect, money, etc., I will definitely go to LBS than any other b-school in the world. but if I have to stay in my country to study, I will choose to go to the University of the Philippines College of Business Administration.
