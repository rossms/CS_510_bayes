There isnt really a point to it. Sure, its very reliable but what is the point of it. Its nothing more than a dressed up Nissan Pathfinder. You dont really get more for the money in the QX4 than you do in the Pathfinder. Of you buy one, you'll get a very reliable vehicle but you will be getting ripped off. If you like it, get a loaded Pathfinder.
