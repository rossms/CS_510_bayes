As an Independent, I'm glad Snowe has more than once stood up to the far right Republican machine, and I am very glad she has fought hard for the veterans of Maine, my home state. I think she could do better to fight more for us little folk by stemming the corruption of Enron, Worldcom, Arthur Andersen, Health South, (and the list goes on). But overall Snowe is is a voice of MODERATION, and many moderate Republican and Democratic voters admire her for that. We desperately need more senators like her.
