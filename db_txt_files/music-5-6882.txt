An absolute jazz masterpiece! Miles changed jazz forever with this album (he would do it again a couple more times)! His intonation is so emotive and eloquent, and juxtaposed with Coltrane's alternately smooth and manic soloing it creates an almost mystic sound! From the delicate piano into on So What to the elegant modal mysticism of Flamenco Sketches , Miles showed the merits of cool jazz as a highly expressive art form.
