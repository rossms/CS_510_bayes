I can't say he was a GREAT president, like Clinton or Roosevelt, he was, however a decent to good president. I can definitely agree completely with TheFreak on this one. I couldn't have said it better myself. If Carter would've been reelected, it would've saved America from the entire Reagan nightmare. He had great ideas.
