The first half of the movie was great with some of the best dialogue of any war movie. You also see the tremendous performance by the actor who played Pyle. No one could have done a better job with his character's transormation from the mildly retarted, inept soldier to madman. The second half seemed like it was an add-on. But I guess it did show that even though you may have thought that boot camp was hell, nothing could prepare you for combat.
