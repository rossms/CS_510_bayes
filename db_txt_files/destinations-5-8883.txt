Timber Wolf Long Cut Straight is my chew of choice. I've been a smokeless tobacco user for 6 years. I've tried almost every brand/flavor on the market and Straight Skoal was by far my favorite. But the money was an issue. This is where Timber Wolf comes in. It is premium tobacco at an affordable price. I definately reccomend it.
