Again, it's great. It provides the best of both worlds. Cheap, long lasting, and a vast amount of variety. For a quarter, each candy on a stick lasts for a very long time. And also your end result and prize (your could say), is a chewy piece of gum in the center. That can also last for another 30 minutes. The other shell being hard candy makes it hard to break through. This allows you to actually suck on it for a long time until you reach the center.
