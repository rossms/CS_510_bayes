Underrated! Go to Oklahoma to see the wide range of wildlife in the countryside. Buffalo, bald eagles, the least tern and migrating monarchs. Good blues crowd and several festivals to see. Tulsa Opera and the ballet in Tulsa and Oklahoma City. And many tex-mex style restaurants, if that's your thing. The people are appreciative and polite.
