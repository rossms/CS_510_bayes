The least progressive of all the New England states- NH is the antithesis of Vermont-Portsmouth, Dover and Concord are very pretty New England towns- its just that Vermont is better, as is Maine- if you like Northern New England. Good thing is the state is becoming more moderate in its views- getting closer idealogically to the rest of New Englands growing progressive idealogy- as opposed to the south, southwest, plains and mountains states backwardness and right wing religous zealot idealogy.
