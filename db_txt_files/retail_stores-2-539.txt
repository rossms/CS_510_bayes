ill-fitting clothes in atrocious colors and of poor quality. I would not have even given it one star if not for their cotton women's underwear. very comfy and fits me wonderfully! My underwear drawer is stocked with them in all colors (the underwear colors are actually attractive rather the rest of their stuff with the hot pinks and puke beiges).
