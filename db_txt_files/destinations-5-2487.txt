Marco Island is gorgeous - very quiet, chill, and calm. If you ever get a chance to get there, make sure to check out Tigertail Beach - it's a public beach, and is about the prettiest beach I've ever been to. Don't try and sleep on the beach and light a campfire, however. The fire department will come quickly.
