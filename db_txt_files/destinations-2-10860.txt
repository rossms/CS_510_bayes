Brendan WorldWide Tours trip to Brazil was bungled from the first to last. We were double-booked at the airport, we were not met at the airport because of a change in flight times for which Rentamar Turismo was not notified, two couples were booked into the same room at the hotel in Manaus, we did not receive our travel vouchers as instructed, we were given wrong information about the use of our credit cards, and a fishing vessel was substituted for the boat for which we paid/booked.
