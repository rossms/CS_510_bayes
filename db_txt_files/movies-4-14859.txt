I liked this movie it was good I like watching movies based on true events. It is about two highschools that merge together one is white and the other is black but anyways neither of the teams liked it for the fact the had to play together. But they have to learn to get along and by the end they do get along and they become friends. I think that Denzel Washington did a good job in this movie.
