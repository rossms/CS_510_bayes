10 years ago I would have rated him great. I think his best days are behind him but would enjoy seeing him rebound with a great performance. I did not care for the Godfather series but his early work such as Dog Day Afternoon and Serpico were very good. Scarface is also a great performance. One of the most quoted characters as well. He has to take a hit for Gigli if nothing else. The fact his name appears on the credits at all is worth a loss of 1 star. Young enough to still get back to greatness. But time is running out.
