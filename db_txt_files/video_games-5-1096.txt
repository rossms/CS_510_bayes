 It's MY turn to operate! OPERATE?!? BZZZZZ!!! Butterfingers! (Laughter.) It's Operation, the wacky doctor's game! Batteries not included. ----anybody remember that ad? This game was fun to play, and I always thought you'd get a nasty shock whenever you touched the metal border with the tweezers. My favorite piece to operate on was the water on the knee and the funny bone. I didn't care if I was adoctor or a specialist; I just liked to see if I could get the pieces out without buzzing myself. (Which is the object, anyway!) A classic MB game.
