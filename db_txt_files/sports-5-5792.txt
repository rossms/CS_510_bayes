With a passion for basketball unmatched in the NCAA, I believe Julius Hodge has it all: the outside shot, the leadership capabilities NCSU needs, the fearless attitude in the lane, and the all-seeing passing abilities. He's a great player with a lot of heart, and he does what it takes to get the job done. Love ya, sweetie, and go PACK!
