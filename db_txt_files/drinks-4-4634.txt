Coca Cola has a strong authentic cola taste and lots of strong carbonation. It's always been great for my digestive process -it acts as an extra acid to break down foods. It also revitalizes and reenergizes. The taste isn't quite as sweet as Pepsi's, but overall it's just as good (but no better; I give them a tie).
