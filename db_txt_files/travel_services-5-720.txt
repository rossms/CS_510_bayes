Had a great experience with Hertz recently: I'd planned on taking a rental car from Boston to NH and back then catching a train to Stamford CT... but happened by a Hertz shop and found I could drop the car in Stamford instead. So I wound up driving some 300 miles within a 24 hr time frame, all for just $75 or so. Nice.
