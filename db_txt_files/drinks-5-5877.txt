It would be better if they didn't try to improve it and make it like they think the Pepsi generation likes things....it is now a bit too sweet. I wish it could be bought in smaller bottles than the 2L bottles (tried cans years ago, and it tasted bad in cans)...best when it used to be still aged in oak and bottled in glass.
