It is the best skating game on the market today. Along with having the best skaters today, they include top of the line sponsor brands and good punk\ska music. Andrew Reynolds is the easiest skater to use. His moves are easy to do and if you do combos, you can score big points. It is a very entertaining game, and I can play it for hours.
