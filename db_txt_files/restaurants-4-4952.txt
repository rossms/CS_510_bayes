There was a long wait for a table on a Tuesday evening at the Massapequa,NY location. The restaurant was very clean and our waiter was gracious and attentive.The main entree looked small but after an appetizer and salad we couldn't finish our meal. Of course we wanted to save room for the desserts also. There were no long intervals between courses. Although on the pricey side for a chain restaurant we were very pleased with the service and the food. We will definetly return to this restaurant.
