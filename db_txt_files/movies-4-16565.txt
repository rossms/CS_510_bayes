I was overall impressed with the movie. Maybe that was because I didn't expect much out of it. If you are expecting this to be a comedy then you are going to be disappointed. The movie focuses on Bev's life struggles, and although it makes light of and brings humor to depressing moments, it really isn't a laugh out loud movie. I like how it showed a real life with real problems though; Drew Barrymore does a decent job.
