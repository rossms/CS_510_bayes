He is great. Him on the inside and Hinrich one the on outside, they are incredible! I think he is a great all around player not only in the paint, but on defense as well so those nice little jumpers that he can hit and make everything look so easy. I really admire his decision to stay at Kansas and finnish out his schooling before he went to the NBA. That shows alot about him. He is awesome!
