While not as good as Where The Wild Things Are, Higglety Pigglety Pop! or Outside Over There, In The Night Kitchen is a bizarre book that is very indicative of it's cultural era(1970). I have read reviews of this book at other sites that have blasted Sendak for the full frontal nudity of the main kid. How someone could be so twisted as to find corrupt intent in this book blows my mind. It's a fun book that kids really seem to enjoy.
