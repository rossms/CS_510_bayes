A disturbing movie in the "Closer" sort of way, but more intense. My buddy saw it and wouldn't give a description. He just said to see it, but definetely don't take a date, which was good advice. The movie's about two married working professionals in downtown Chicago who fatefully meet on the train into the city when Clive Owen realizes he doesn't have enough cash to pay the fare, and an ensuing love affair causes some major drama. Jennifer Aniston was pretty believable in her role. There were some big twists and turns, and if you can bare with them you'll enjoy the movie.
