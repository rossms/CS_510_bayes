Just what I wanted when I traded my SUV- the same space and double the mileage. Even in a cold climate, I never used 4wd more than once a year, and the xB has great traction control. Its been 12 months and I still love it, great reliability and handling, although the ride is very stiff. I will change to larger tires and possibly spring enhancements later. Why not? My xB cost less than a Corolla new and I save $800 a year on gas, so after 5 years I will put another $800 into it and drive it forever.
