Among this pitiful list of POP music and some Michael Jackson songs, this brilliant song has to stand above all the rest. The music video is awsome too, and does a good job in showing how the the person is feeling despite its simplicity. It goes deep in the soul, the way the video was made. This is certainly a great song that will live on forever, for its lyrics say a great deal!
