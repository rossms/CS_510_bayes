Yeah, I know everyone's sick of Madonna (especially that British accent she has somehow developed over the years). However, her old stuff was pretty cool. Like A Prayer is a pretty cheesy video but it did contain things which weren't common at the time: interracial sex (which is still not common on TV), burning crosses and a black Christ. So, despite being cheesy, it deserves some respect for the controversy it caused.
