THis is a great store. Much better quality than Walmart. And it is community friendly. It worked 25 years ago and it works today. It doesn't put everyone out of business like these ridiculous Walmart SuperCenters. Walmart is trying to buy everything. SHOP AROUND PEOPLE! Thats how you get a low price and quality. I would rather pay twenty dollars for a premium martha stewart product than some cheap generic walmart product.
