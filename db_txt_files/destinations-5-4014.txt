I have been in all 50 states, and the Tampa Bay area is the best place to live. A combination of great weather, nice people, low cost of living, good business opportunities and lots of fun things to do. So come for a visit and spend some money, but don't move here. It is big enough, and we don't want to become another Atlanta. Thank you.
