Tuned into this on cable, and really enjoyed it. Fine acting, well written script. Nothing particularly special or flashy, just a simply put movie about the idiosyncrasies of a modern-day trio of sisters living at home. Rent it for the family, or just for yourself if you enjoy the occasional emotional family films.
