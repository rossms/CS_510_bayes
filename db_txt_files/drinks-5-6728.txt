It is a heavenly concoction of perfection that never gets old. It is simple too delicious to pass up, with the creaminess of the frappuccino, the softness of the whip cream and the way they spiral the syrup on the puffy cloud-like cream is so scrumptious that it makes your mouth water instantly. The flavor is so rich, a combination of coffee and chocolate, the two best flavors ever. I would work there if I could have an unlimited amount of mocha frappuccinos!
