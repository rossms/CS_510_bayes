I believe Elton John wrote many of the songs on this soundtrack (like The Circle of Life). Those songs were great. I would give this a 5 if Disney didn't have any other cartoon soundtracks to compare it to. But that's not the case. Next to the classics like Beauty the Beast and Aladdin , I can only give this a 4 .
