Truely I think Nique was one the best of all time, it was impossible to find one player who could stop him! And you think Vince Carter can dunk! This guy had some of the sweetist hops I've seen in my life! I think it was an insult that they didn't put him on the top 50 of all time. The only reason his hawks couldn't make it to the finals was becuase he had no one to help him out, and he would always have to compete against birds celtics. You can hate him all you wan't but you can't deny it, Nique is one of the greatist ever!
