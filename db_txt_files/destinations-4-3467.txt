Very decent and civil place to live, but a tad stuffy. There's good nightlife and plenty of culture due to the strong college/university presence there. The food is pretty good and there's enough sports activity to keep one diverted. It is a safe city, comparatively speaking, and cleaner than most, but driving and parking there is a nightmare. This is a great city to go to school or start your career if you're a 20 something, but I don't feel there's much of a middle-aged scene like in other cities. All in all, one of the North American best cities to visit or live in.
