At nearly 40 years of age, I have had my share of vodka over the years. Stoli, Absolut, Grey Goose, Skky...I've tried most all of them. A friend of mine told me about this Kozak and I tried it. I have never had a more smooth, more outstanding vodka in my life. And at $20 +/- for a 750ml...The price simply adds to the quality inside.
