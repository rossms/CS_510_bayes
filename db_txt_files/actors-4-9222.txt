I like Diane lane the first movie I saw her in was A Little Romance. she was great as the 13yr old girl who found her first boyfried in France. she has since proven herself to be a fine actress . I have not seen lots of her movies but have liked her in the ones I have seen. I recently saw her in Under the Tuscan Sun and she was very good in that movie. I am glad she is getting more appreciation as an actress now.
