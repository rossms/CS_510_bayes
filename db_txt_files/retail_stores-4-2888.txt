I love jewelry and I purchased several pieces of diamond jewelry from the Whitehall Jewelers at the Coliseum Mall in Hampton, VA. Try as I might, I can't ever remember being disappointed or having felt bad about any of the purchases. Some of the negative comments are frightening and I can only remember Zales as the store I would NEVER shop in again. I'm glad my experiences have been positive -- I hate being taken for a fool or having some salesperson stress me out when I know what's right and they don't have a clue.
