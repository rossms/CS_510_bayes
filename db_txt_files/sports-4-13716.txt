How can you not give Brian Billick a high rating as a coach. Besides having taken a team whch had never had a winning season to a convincing Super Bowl victory in his second season, he took his 2002 team, a team which had 19 rookies and free agents, and kept them in the playoff race until the 15th week. A team which many of the experts said would finish lower than the Benagals in their division. He is, without a doubt, one of the finest coaches in the league today. In my opinion, he organizes and motivates as good or better than any coach in the game.
