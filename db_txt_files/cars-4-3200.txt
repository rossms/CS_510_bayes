If we're talking the new ones and by that I mean anything between 1980 and now I don't care so much for them. However, if we are talking the classic safari style vehicle of the 70's then we've got a whole other story on our hands. Those Cruisers are something to be desired. When I was living in Costa Rica a buddy of mine had an early 70's Land Cruiser that he used to let me take all day while he was working and man was that thing a blast to drive. Up the mountain grinding it out in low gear, tooling around the cities and towns bumping along, great truck and a lot of fun.
