I go there all the time, and I love the bar. The drinks are awesome, and the bartenders are very efficient, given the volume of drinks made. My favorite bartender is Joel, who stuffed my olive with his bleu cheese. I recomend going there when it's not so busy, the bar gets packed. And from my observations I noticed that you should not stand in the service bar, it is dangerous. You should probably also tip big, so they remember you. They see thousands of faces in there per week. My favorite meal is: Ultimate Margarita, Thai Lettuce Wraps, Lousiana Chicken Pasta, and Dulce de Leche Cheesecake.
