Gary Williams' teams are always in the Top 10 in the RPI Ratings. Obviously Gary Williams doesn't choose CREAM PUFF schedules like most of the teams in the Big East (with the exception of Connecticut). And they only beat North Carolina on their home court the past four seasons..if that's not a Big Game, I don't know what is!
