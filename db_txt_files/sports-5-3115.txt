Mays became perhaps the greatest all-around player in baseball history. In his 22 year career (including 21 with the New York/San Francisco Giants and 1 with the New York Mets), he clubbed 660 home runs, stole 338 bases and hit .300 10 times. Willie won 12 Gold Glove awards for his magic in center field, and played in 24 All-Star games.
