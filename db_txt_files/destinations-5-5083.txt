HOOCHIE...I'm one of those rude, snobby, stuck on myself, and not to bright New Yorkers and I'm proud of it. Did you happen to watch some of us stuck on ourselves people after the bombing? We showed courage and bravery through our tears. New York State is one of the most beautiful places on earth. Our beaches are some of the best on Earth. When you drive upstate it is breath taking. And by the way, New Yorkers are hard working, giving (and proved it), caring (and proved it) people I have ever met.
