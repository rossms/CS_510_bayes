It's difficult to take this team seriously, but it isn't their fault: it's the fault of the Lords of Baseball who decided it was a swell idea to place a franchise in a city 1 mile above sea level. The Rockie pitchers must really hate pitching in that ballpark and it's difficult to get a handle on an offensive player's numbers when they're amassing statistics up in the stratosphere. This squad does have some very decent players, but in 2003 they don't look like much more than a .500 team, if that.
