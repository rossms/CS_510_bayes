Along with Tim Duncan, one of the only two championship-caliber players in today's NBA. Mind you that they couldn't be there without Shaq, but Kobe is the guy you want hittin' that jumper with three seconds left in an NBA Finals Game 7. Definitely a guy who could never pull a Nick Anderson. Does this guy ever get nervous?
