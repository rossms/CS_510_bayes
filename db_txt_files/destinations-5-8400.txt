Pure decadence! I love South Beach. It's a wonderfully fun place, although I find I enjoy it more now that I can afford the better hotels and better restaurants. Cool architecture and culture, hot people and killer nightlife make it great for me. Oh, and if you're a Spanish speaker (like me), you have an even better time! You can ignore the trailer trash from the Midwest and the Eurotrash and focus on the friendly natives-- South Beach RULES!
