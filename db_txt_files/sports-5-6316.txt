Awesome, Outstanding, Incredible, Dominant, and THE BEST! You can't determine who is the better team by who beat who or by who is number one in the conference...It's who gets the job done in a game, and Duke has done a spectular job @ getting the job done. I was nervous about this basketball season @ first, but I have developed faith in my DUKE BLUE DEVILS> and you can tell with every game they play that they have developed that same kind of faith in themselves and in their teammates! Duke is AWESOME and I take it as a priviledge to watch them! >DUKE BLUE DEVILS!
