This car should cost more. Fast and a great resale value. My family has 2 and we love them. The only compable cars in the price range are volvos and the mazda millenia. Watch out for the repairs outside of warrenty, quite expensive. If you want a lexus quility car but don't want to pay for it, buy an avalon. In addtion this is a safe car, very safe and awful fast. On several ocasions I have looked down at my speedometer and seen it going past 90 when I thought I was only at 75. smooth, quiet and did I mention fast?
