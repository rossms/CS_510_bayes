For a small mountain theme park, Dollywood is a great park. The staff treat you like family and everyone is so friendly. The shows are awesome and the Tennessee Tornado, even though it's short, it's an awesome coaster. I can't wait until Thunderhead, Dollywood's first wooden coaster opens this spring. I'll be there!
