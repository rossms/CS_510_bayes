I personally liked it. I left with a stomach ache from the theatre because the movie was kinda twisted and it was wierd to see how a normal mans life could change because a hand dealt by god. For those who have seen that movie think about it. Jack Nicholson is usually great but i didnt know what to say about his performance here, it was different because i'm not used to seeing him in that kind of acting postition but none the less he did a good job. The director Sean Penn also didnt do that bad of a job although I'm sure he could've done a little better.
