I am not a smoker but I have been known to smoke a cigarette or two when I have had enough drinks in me. Back in college this happened on a more frequent basis but as of now, I have slowed my pace down so it is a lot more infrequent but nothing beats a Marlboro Light when I get in the mood. They are light enough that I can handle it. It goes down smooth in comparison to other cigarettes. It is just a basic safety of a novice cigarette smoker.
