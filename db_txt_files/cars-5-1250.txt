I absolutely LOVE my altima!! When looking for a car, I knew I wanted a good reliable vehicle. I was originally looking for a Toyota Corolla, but I chose the Nissan Altima because of it's smooth ride and luxurious features. I thought the corolla had a rather bland and simple interior. I am very happy with my choice! I hope to have my Altima for a very long time.
