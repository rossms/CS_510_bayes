Al Gore is obviously the best man for the presidency. Unfornately he is not doing so well in the preliminary polls. Please vote the right way. Al Gore for President. If you want to see the rich taking over our rights to choose in terms of taxes, social security, abortion, and most importantly the environment then you will be voting for a rapid decline of the prosperity of our country. Vote Gore!
