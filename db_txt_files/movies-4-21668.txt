Hm, kids don't like Chewie. Maybe he's too big and gruff. Hey! Let's make a smaller version, anagram his species name and sell stuffed toys! Hurrah! A MARKETABLE version! Now, how about the ending? Should we make Luke a true tragic hero who fails and turns evil? Gosh, the American audience won't like that, Mr Lucas. Lets have a warm, snuggly ending with success, redemption, and ... fireworks! Yay! Still, better than the newest ones.
