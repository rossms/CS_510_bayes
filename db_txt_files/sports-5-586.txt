I think Derek Jeter is the best shortstop there is. He is so awesome at what he does. He has such talent and he worked really hard to get where he is at today and he deserves to win as many world series as he wants to win. He is my favorite player on the yankees. Alot of kids look up to him, i kow i do. I want to play just like him. Jeters Got It Goin On! Yankees Rule!!!!!
