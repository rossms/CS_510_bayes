Saw this movie with great anticipation and was really really disappointed. Only laughed out loud once during the entire movie. The rest of the movie theater was dead quiet and several people left before it was over. Mini me sucks and was a bad idea. Fat bastard was the only remotely funny part of the movie. does not hold a candle to the original.
