I think this is one of the most under-rated movies of all time! I never ever understood why this movie got so little attention from the press and media and why the vast majority of the public chose to ignore it. Is it because the theme of slavery and its origins in North america is a subject that some would rather forget about? I really don't have any answers. Very powerful movie/story, very good cast, nice as a whole.
