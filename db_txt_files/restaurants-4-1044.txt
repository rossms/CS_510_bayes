Boston Market is a good choice if you want a quick homestyle meal. The chicken is excellent, and there are lots of good side dishes available. I've had the turkey there, too, and it's very good. The food is a bit pricier than what you find at other fast food restaurants, but the quality is much higher, too. For at least a year, I've been hearing that Boston Market is not making it financially. I'm keeping my fingers crossed that it stays afloat.
