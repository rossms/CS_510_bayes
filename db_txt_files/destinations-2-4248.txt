I can't believe this city is among Texas' major tourist destination. I guess that speaks volumes about how boring this state really is. Like many cities in the sunbelt, this city has very little personality. There is no sense of history or culture. No historic architectures. Downtown is dead at night. City is very spread out. Dallas appears to be one large suburb than a real city. The main attraction is Dallas is the 6th floor museum. While you're in the Dallas area, it probably is worthwhile to stop by the Fort Worth stockyards.
