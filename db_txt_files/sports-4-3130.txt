While I agree that Mays was a great player, for Metstotop to say he was a better avg. hitter than Ruth is silly. Ruth's lifetime avg. was .342. Mays was .302. Clearly, that makes Ruth a better avg hitter. While I agree that Mays had few equals in fielding, may I remind you that Ruth had a 94-46 record with a 2.28 ERA. He was considered the best lefthander in the American league, and probably would have made the HOF as a pitcher. I feel safe and completely comfortable in saying Ruth was the greatest player of all-time.
