That's brazilian instant coffee, and, among the instant coffees, it's the best one. For those who didn't like, you'd better review your concepts, maybe you really dislike instant coffee. I agree it can't beat the expresso, but as a instant coffee, I repeat that's the best. Suggestion: try it with hot milk, not water, that makes a delicious creamy drink.
