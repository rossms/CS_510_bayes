Oh boy. I'm a Steve McQueen fan and this a bombastic disappointment. Granted, this is primarily qualified by what movie makers and effects artists can do nowadays with films like ConAir but I believe that one stinks as well. Not much talent displayed here among the amazing A list actors, e.g., McQueen, Newman, Dunaway, Holden, ad infinitum. I've one request: miss it!
