Brilliant but not Bond... Everything (to me) is great except for - Framerate (choppy in areas) - Weapons (too weird) - Level Layouts (some were yukky!) - Futuristic Theme (it ruined the the majority of the levels) apart from that the voice acting is humourous (hehe Cover my ass! ), the enemies have more depth, some of Goldeneye's elements like the green computer screens make a return, the multi is a complete shootout except for the framerate... still a great game though, can't wait for a sequel!
