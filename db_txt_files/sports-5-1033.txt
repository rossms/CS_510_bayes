I realize that most comments made before mine came before Bobby Bonds passing; but what we have witnessed in the last few weeks are nothing but heroic. How many of you out there(after losing your father and best friend) could not only do your job, but at a level that makes what you did before, well ordinary? I personally was overjoyed the day that Barry joined my Giants; not as a good interview after the game but as a solid contributer on the field.The time has come to acknowledge the greatest player that any of us are lucky to watch play the game we all love !!!GO GIANTS!!!!!
