He is really an MVP caliber QB. He came back to earth a bit in 2000, but he was injured. He has good timing and touch. Most comparaisons he draws are to Dan Fouts. He makes very quick decisions. Although not a scrambler, Warner is hard to get to because of his quick release. His arm is not as strong as a Peyton Manning or Daunte Culpepper, but the St. Louis system utilizes mostly short to intermediate routes, where Warner's accuracy shines.
