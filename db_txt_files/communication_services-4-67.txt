good rates! i pay just 5 cents a min.! Our rate decreases every month or so. I also think the bills are organized better than verizons and at t's. I liek the fact that they changes thier name to power net besause we had no log distance for a month or so, because we had a HUGE bill that was over $2 grand and we didn't pay it off because it was my older bro calling his freinds in australlia and some to other countries. and casue of that our LD was cut off and we could not go back to qwest. he had to pay some of it off but later, quest changed their name so we went right back to them and that was cool.
