I am NOT a Willie fan. Never have been. I like a few of his tracks, solo and duets, but this in my opinion is the ONLY Willie album worth buying. A classic in every since of the word. The fact it was recorded with nothing but Willie and his battered guitar is very rare and it gives the entire album a feel of intimacy and lets the songs speak to you as if you were right there while it was being recorded. Each of the tracks bring another part of Willie's story to life and it all blends togother from The Time Of The Preacher to Blue Eyes Crying In The Rain. Totally worth it!
