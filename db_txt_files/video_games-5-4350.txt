This game is awesomely open-ended, but at the same time constricting. But in a good way. I love all the people taht can join your party and the interesting characters you meet along the way. The little classifaction you get (for example: grave robber or mack daddy ) are hilariously animated by the guy whom I've dubbed the fallout guy.
