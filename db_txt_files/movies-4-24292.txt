The battle of Zion is indeed very well made, it was over 40 minutes long. That was one of the best Sci-Fi battle scenes i have ever seen. But the end fight between Smith and Neo was just way too long, i mean it could have just finished with a simple meaningful fight, instead Neo keeps on coming back and it just drags on. This third installment is has even more philosophies and religious beliefs. Finally, the ending was very open but somewhat satisfied. I still think the first movie was the best in the series.
