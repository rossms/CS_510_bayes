The action scenes were extremely well choreographed. The storyline presented in this segment of the whole story *yes this is not the full story, this is just a small part* was not the greatest selection but it did leave an aura of mystique as it did not give total closure (i.e. the guy from the desert and the girl who stole the sword get married at the end in actuality) and one thing that irked me is that they never really explained the tiger and dragon part [tiger = guy from desert, dragon = girl who stole sword (only using these terms for relativity to movie)]
