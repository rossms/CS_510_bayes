3 words, that actually make a name. Michael Clarke Duncan. Wow, talk about making a movie. Not only his size, but his emotion. This movie is an extremely good film. It stars Tom Hanks in one of his better acted roles, inluding the whole urinary infection which is magnificently portrayed. Really this movie does not overtsay it's time either, using all 3 hours for a fantastic storyline. There is one word of caution however, it is not recommended for children. It has nearly 100 profane words, and some sexual dialogue. But for the adults, this is a must see.
