I can't sit here and say I enjoyed the book, because that would make me as horrible as his mother, and his father for that matter. The fact that this mother never paid for her extreme abuse on David makes me so angry! I can't believe, no matter what decade it was, that no one could help that child. I pray everyday for those who are still out there, enduring the same treatment at the hands of a caregiver. My heart is with you all.
