This is a great place to relax and enjoy a coffee drink with a friend. It is trendy and generally the employees and customers are young, attractive people. I really enjoy the specialty coffee drinks but they are so expensive. My favorite is the white chocolate mocha. I get a grande (their medium size) and it costs me $4.00 - almost as much as my lunch! It is fun to go once a week but if you get a special coffee every workday, you're looking at close to $100/month.
