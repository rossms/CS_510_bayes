These books are so cool! It is very rare to find a series that sucks you in and doesn't let you go until the very end. Though the 1st book was slow starting it proved terrific at the end, especially with the ending. The second book is slightly under notch though still enjoyable and the third is flat out fantastic. I would have to say the fool is my favourite character of all time! Fans make sure you check out the Liveship trilogy and the Tawny man trilogy, the latter is especially good!
