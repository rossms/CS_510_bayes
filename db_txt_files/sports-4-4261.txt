Tubby is a good coach, probably the best defensive coach in college basketball. But...as a born and bred Wildcat fan I have to say he needs to get some of his teams to the final four! The only time he went was with a team that Pitino built. Kentucky fans know a good coach when they see one, and Tubby is a fine coach, but if he doesn't get on the ball, there will be roar start coming out of Lexington for his head. We can only be patient so long...
