I drive a 1999 GLS Wagon, 1.8L turbo 4cyl, 5 spd manual. It has 80K miles on it. I drive quite a bit and enjoy the ride. the older models have awful cupholders but I have found the car to be incredibly reliable. I also average over 30 MPG city and highway (though most of my driving is highway). I had a great experience with the dealerships I have used. I would recommend it to anyone and would also consider purchasing again.
