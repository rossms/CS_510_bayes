We have a 2004 CX Plus package and we have over 18,000 miles. We have had it just over a year and have only had in the shop once for some window hardware. No other problems to report and we get 25MPG on trips from Springfield Ohio to Erie Pa at 65 to 70 MPH. I have owned many cars and this one is not bad.
