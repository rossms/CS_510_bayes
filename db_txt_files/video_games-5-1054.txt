All skill--there is no luck involved here. Five stars only if you are the type to commit several intense hours (or weeks for correspondence play) into a ruthless strategy game. Loads of fun. Warning #1: It takes a while to learn--make certain someone there knows the game thoroughly. The only other drawback is that you need seven players for a good game and weak or disinterested players make for a dull game. Warning #2: It's addicting and will absolutely consume you. I have some of my middle school students play and they lose all focus on schoolwork--but they sure learn their European geography!
