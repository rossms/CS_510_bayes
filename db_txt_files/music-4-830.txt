Dizzy Up the Girl by the Goo Goo Dolls is an excellent cd. The vocals seem older and wiser whereas the lyrics deal with typical youthful dramas. You hear favorites such as Iris from the movie CITY OF ANGELS and Baby's Black Balloon from the film MEET YOU BLACK. Although not heavy rock, this cd definately kix.
