Worth my while. I was surprised and impressed at the quality of the acting performances with the exception of Brittany Murphy who was just as annoying here as she is in most of her other movies ( I'll ne-ver-tee-ell ). My only complaint is that I would've enjoyed seeing more of the rap freestyle scenes.
