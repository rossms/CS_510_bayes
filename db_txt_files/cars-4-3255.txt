It is a solid 4X4. I love every thing about it except it gets poor gas milage. It is comfortable to ride in and I have had a broken back. I like this better than my old Pathfinder. The fit and finish on my Jeep is perfect. And my dealer service is excellent. I rate this a 4-1/2. Like I said gas milage is my only complaint
