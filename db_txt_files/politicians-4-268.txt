When Charles ascended to the throne, the power of the monarchy had been largely limited by Parliament. He was largely effective in his desire to cooperate with Parliament. Although somewhat neglegent in the area of foreign affairs, Charles II did manage to form a short-term alliance with France and ward off threats from the Dutch. His greatest legacy, however, was restoring domestic peace and tranquility to the English social and political system and bringing about a period of ultimate economic and social prosperity that would follow his reign.
