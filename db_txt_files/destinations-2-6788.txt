If you like boarded-up buildings, high crime and dead streets than you'll like Omaha. If you like a clean, vibrant four-star city with tons of cheap eats and nice people choose Lincoln. East Omaha is just a boarded-up, decaying disaster. However, far West Omaha is growing fast because it's a half-hour away from Lincoln. Lincoln, Nebraska is way underated. Lincoln, can hold its own even when comparing it to Kansas City or St. Louis.
