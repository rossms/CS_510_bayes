A dreary, freezing in the winter, muggy and bug invested in the summer, company town. Do yourself a favour and give it a miss. However, if you do have to go, make sure you cross the bridge to Hull, the Quebec city on the east side of the river. It is as different from Ottawa as New Orleans is from Des Moines. It has been said that if anyone wanted to destroy Ottawa, they could blow up the bridge to Hull, wait two weeks and everyone would be dead of boredom.
