His stockiness was the perfect build to generate that kind of power and bat speed. Some players have graceful, balletic swings - Killer's was sudden and ferocious - almost violent. His homeruns weren't lazy rainbows they were screeching liners. I'm not sure it if was at the Metrodome or the old park, but he once hit a homerun so hard it shattered a pair of plastic seats in the upper deck. Apparently, they replaced the seats with a pair of a different color so they would stand out, kind of a cool memorial.
