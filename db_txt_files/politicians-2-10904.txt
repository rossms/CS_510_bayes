Lieberman seems to get rolled over by many of the opposition party. Like Clinton, he seems to waiver back and forth over many issues and has made some questionable judgments, like blaming the PC Gaming industry for the Columbine disaster. He was pathetic in the 2000 VP debate with Cheney--a debate he should have easily one but one he gave in to Cheney's false claims about his success in the private sector (Halliburton has benefited immensely from govt contracts).
