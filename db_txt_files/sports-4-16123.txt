I woulg give him 5 stars if he improved his passing game and also if he could see and read the field better!!!Vick looks across the field for 2 seconds and after thoses 2 seconds, if there is no one open, he starts running!!This makes me think, that he isn't much of a qb!Yes he does have speed but what has he done other than get over 100 yards rushing and UNDER 100 yards passing!!He'd prolly be be a better running back than he is as a Quarterback.
