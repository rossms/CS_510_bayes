Grand Prix was tolerable. It was a racing game which depicts a Formula One race going left to right where you merely have to beat your own time or other players time, there wasn't an actual you vs. the computer contest. The Game featured bridges and oil slicks and sounds of a car smacking another in the rear. Once you pass a car they don't come from behind. For its time it may have been cutting edge, today its completely passable. Its a step up from Dodge 'Em.
