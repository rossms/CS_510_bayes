Clemson definitely deserved a better bowl, FSU beating VA Tech knocked Clemson out of the Peach bowl and into the Champ bowl. FSU has no business in a BCS bowl with a 7-4 regular season record. Clemson should be ranked between 18 23, and will probably be ranked in the top 10 if James Davis can stay healthy. This guy is a freshman and put up 879 yards and 9 touchdowns and he was didnt play the whole season.
