Campbell's soup has good flavor but other than the tomato soup, they put MSG (monsodium glutamate) in the other condensed flavors. Apparently, somebody sold them a bill of goods because soup doesn't need a flavor preservative if it's good soup. It's a waste of money and puts a lot of people, who don't know they're sensitive to high doses of sodium, at a health risk. I believe the 'Healthy Request' line leaves out the MSG but it's more expensive and often needs to be doctored to taste right.
