Best catcher in the NAtional League! one of the best catchers in baseball. forget mikey piazza and his permed bleached hair--Jason Kendall is the real deal--a throw back to the days when teams in New York or expansion cities didnt win every year b/c of their bank accounts. Even in 2 injury plagued seasons, Jason Kendall has managed to play his heart out where in other cities, cry babies like Ken i used to be good Griffey jr. cry about how badly they are treated while they watch their chance at greatness slip away. Already a 7 year vet, Kendall is only going to be 28....future HOF'er!!
