SO SINFUL! The Chocolate Devotion and German Chocolate is INSANE. The only downfall is the calories and price. If you went all out for a small chocolate devotion in a chocolate dipped waffle cone you'd be averaging 1,200 calories. Eeek... but as a treat it's worth the calories and the price! (And if you tip the ice cream makers they sing!)
