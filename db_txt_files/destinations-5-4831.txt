People (european and american) think that Latin America is like Africa. They don't realize that after Europe and USA we are the richest area of the world. Brazil, Argentina, Uruguai and Chile are 4 very interesting and beauitful contries of South America. People from Argentina are very rude and unpolite but all the world know that they are rich. So, because of argentina, European and americans don't have as much prejudice as they would have against us.
