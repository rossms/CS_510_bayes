She's come along way from her straight to video sex roles in the 80's. She's obviously earned enough respect to be permitted to keep her clothes in a movie. And Maddmarxx was right...she was great in This Boy's lIfe. You really should read that book. It's one of the best non-fiction books I've ever read(Tobias Wolff wrote it). Ellen Barkin is a beautiful woman who has obviously not been satisfied to leave well enough alone. She has greatly improved her acting skills.
