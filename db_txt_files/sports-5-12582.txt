UF will be in Pasadena when the smoke clears on the 2001 season. QB may be a concern, but Rex Grossman is good enough. WR is not a concern, with Jabar Gaffney and Reche Caldwell returning. The lines should also be strong. LB may be weak. The secondary may be the best in america, led by CB Lito Sheppard. The Gators need, as always, to beat FSU and Tennessee to contend.
