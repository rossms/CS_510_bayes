I don't gamble but if I did it would be on sports. Mainly college football. The pros are doable but don't interest me. Other sports have odd lines and are not something I care to try and master. College football betting would be great if I had spare money. Beating the spread requires a fair amount of skill and luck. The over/unders are also interesting. Even with spare money I might not risk turning a game I enjoy into a headache.
