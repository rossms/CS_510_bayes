How could anyone give the greatest pitcher of all time less than 5 stars? The man's a legend. It's an honor to drive on Nolan Ryan expressway in Arlington, TX. And that time when that guy from the White Sox charged the mound and Nolan put the loser in a headlock and opened up a can.....now that was unforgettable; especially for a guy in his 40s to be putting the hurt on a younger, cockier player.
