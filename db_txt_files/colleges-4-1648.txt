Gorgeous place. . .quality graduate schools. Excellent local opportunities (Being in D.C. and all. . .) Very nice place to go to school. Bad things- boring white people that aren't as smart as they think they are. G-town is a money school for kids who couldn't get into an Ivy. . .but some act like real pretentious snobs. Other than the uppity student-body, G-town is a very decent (but expensive) school.
