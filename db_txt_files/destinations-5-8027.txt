Very humbling and somber experience. I got the same feeling when I visited Arlington. Hallowed grounds. And while at Pearl Harbor I too had the fortunate experience of hearing a survior speak of that day. Of course it all brought back memories of another survivor I heard speak of that day. My own uncle was a Pearl Harbor survivor. This is one of those places that definetly changes you (hopefully for the better) after having visited there.
