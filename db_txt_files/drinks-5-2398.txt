Harney and Sons has an excellent selection of loose teas. An excellent Earl Grey Supreme and a very tastey Mango black tea. Their catalogues are very nicely done and they're turn around for ordering is excellent. It really is a family too which is great! They always have pictures of the sons out and about in Asia going tea hunting and then shots of an ever growing mass of grandchildren. A true tea lovers source.
