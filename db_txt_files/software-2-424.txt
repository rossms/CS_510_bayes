Windows 95 was my first operating system. I had to deal with the blue screens and computer crashes. Sometimes this bloody operating systems would stop working at all. I agree that Windows 95 is an outdated system. Some computer games only accept Windows 98 and above. Now, I used this Wndows 95 as a typewritter.
