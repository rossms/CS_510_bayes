barry bonds is without question an all-time great but there are people who believe that he is better than Ruth stats do not bare this out. Ruth was a successful pitcher(89 wins). Played alot fewer games than Bonds(approximately 200 games at present). Ruth made basesball. That being said there is no question Bonds is the best playerin the last 25 years
