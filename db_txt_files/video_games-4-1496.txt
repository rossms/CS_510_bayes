This game is very attracting and will keep you playing until your done. But, what i look for in a game is something that will give me an ambition to play it continuously even though i have already beaten it. I would NOT select this game if it were the only game that you would get this year and i say this because, though you will play it to the death and it might make you want to say things which you might regret, this game is only something that one would have the ambition to play once and only once. But it was a good game so i cannot complain.
