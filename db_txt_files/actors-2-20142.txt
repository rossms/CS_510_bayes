I don't like her now, but I remember way back when Courtney Thorne-Smith had a part in some terrible movie ( Summer School ?) that starred Mark Harmon as a teacher. She was really, really cute in that movie. But I didn't like her Melrose Place character, and I really didn't like her character on Ally McBeal. She seems too stiff or something - like she doesn't have any sense of humor.
