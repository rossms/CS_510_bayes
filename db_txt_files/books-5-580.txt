I love the story of the Velveteen Rabbit. A close friend sent me a beautiful hard cover copy of this book eleven years ago and I treasure it still. My friend told me about this lovely book and how it deals with becoming real. I like this book because it's a beautiful story and it is well written. The Velveteen Rabbit tells us that we are all loved, even if we are imperfect, even as we grow old.
