Bojangles is a relatively inexpensive chicken outlet very similar to Popeye's. I am not sure how widespread the franchise is, but they are rather common in the Carolinas. Some outlets offer a choice between Cajun (ie spicier) and Southern style chicken. Go for the Cajun and extra seasoning salt on your french fries. The biscuits are yummy as well, and you get plenty of them, even in a regular size.
