These books are some wonderful reading. Gabaldon is a pro at character development. The love story of Jaime and Claire just pulls you in and the historical context makes it very interesting as well. If you like these books you should also check out, Lord John Grey and the Private Matter, her newest spinoff book on the Outlander series. I like that one a lot too.
