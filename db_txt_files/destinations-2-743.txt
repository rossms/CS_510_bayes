Why do some Americans have such an inflated opinion of European countries. At least in America we have religious freedom. In Sweden all citizens are automatically born into the Lutheran church. Yet at the same time pastors at these state-sponsored churches are not even allowed to preach the traditional beliefs of the Lutheran church such as that homosexuality is wrong. Talk about mixed up integration of church and state.
