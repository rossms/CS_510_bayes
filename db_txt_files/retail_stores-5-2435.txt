I loathe grocery shopping! However, when I visit Whole Foods/Fresh Fields Market I love it! Staffs always super friendly and extremely knowledgeable. Even when busy, I feel customers as well as staff radiate a positive attitude and energy. Plenty of hugging going on! This market is a virtual think tank of good for you ideas and concepts. And, at least at the store in my town, a gathering place for some of the healthiest, fittest, hottest and friendliest young women! I wish their prices were lower. However, it seems, that to be healthy exacts premium prices. But, it s worth it!
