I just don't get it. Any of it. First of all, how does this guy end up with Courtney Cox? Does she have a thing for annoying, talentless men? Second, why is this guy in the movies? Really, what am I missing? I understand that there's a need for someone to play oddball characters, but can't they choose funny, entertaining actors for those parts? I've heard David Arquette interviewed a few times, and he seems nice, so I'm not giving him one star. But until he does some decent work I don't even think this guy is an average actor.
