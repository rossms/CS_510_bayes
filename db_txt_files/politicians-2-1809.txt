Ed Rendell has not impressed me. He seems to be the average tax-happy, big government socialist liberal. (By the way..I am NOT a Republican!) I will commend Gov. Rendell for cutting SOME government waste, and for supporting motorcyclists' right to choose on helmets. He needs to keep up his end of the deal and push for property tax relief! He fought hard for the income tax increase, so I know he has it in him. I would most likely choose any respectable independent, Libertarian, or Republican to replace him in 2006.
