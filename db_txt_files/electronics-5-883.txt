Owning one of these myself, I like the practicality of these phones. There is a variety of accessories, and you can even change the face plate on them. These phones are very reliable and the battery life is terrific, ranging up to 11 days with Pacific Bell service. They're also small and compact, and comfortable to hold. I know my phone will last me for a while.
