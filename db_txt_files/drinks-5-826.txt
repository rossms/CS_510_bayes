Amstel Light is in my top three along with Heineken. They might even count as one beer since Heineken makes Amstel light and they taste very similar. Amstel has become my safety net. Like when you go up to the bar, and the bartender asks what you want but you haven't thought about it and haven't had a chance to see what they have, well, Amstel is what I say when I go blank. It is a great way to start out the night. It is light so you don't get too full and bloated. Another all time favorite beer of mine.
