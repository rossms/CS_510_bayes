I love Favre and the Packers. Brett still has a gun and can make all the throws. He doesn't move as well as used to but that matters little because that has never really been part of his game. Brett still makes too many stupid mistakes; ie throwing into double coverage. Still one of the best and he's one of the reasons why the Packers have been solid the last 10 years. Future Hall Of Famer without a doubt.
