I hate commercials in general...I think they are stupid and very annoying, but I absolutely love the Sierra Mist commercials. They make me laugh out loud. And I love the taste of Sierra Mist. I believe that it is Shockingly Refreshing. I always have some in my house. Everyone I know drinks it now. Thank you so much for the wonderful product and marketing of it.
