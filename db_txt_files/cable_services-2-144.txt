I was having a terrible time getting through to customer service. It takes minutes in the voice tree to talk to somebody. Just got a rate increase. I have HD service but will not recieve FOX or NBC in HD in the SF area in the foresable future. Which means I pay for HD service and equipment but won't be watching Superbowl in HD.
