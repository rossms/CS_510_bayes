I had this at a friends house, who raved about the quality and that it's the best pinot grigio. I thought it was good, but when I went looking for it at the store and it was selling for $24.99 a bottle here in Michigan, I thought the price was ridiculous. There are other pinot grigios for less money that taste as good if not better than this brand.
