Lebron has been impressive so far. He is scoring better than he did during the preseason, and i wonder how he will be over the long haul this season. But he has been rebounding and giving out assists as well, and looks to be the real deal. He is lightyears ahead of where Kwame Brown was at the same time two years ago.
