If Bias was at the time the greatest hoops prospect since Jordan, then it begs the question why the Cavaliers picked Brad Daugherty instead. While centers were and still are still highly valued, Bias could have been as much, if not a better player to build around. Also does anyone recall if Bias was a good 3-pt shooter?
