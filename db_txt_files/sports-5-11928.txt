Probably the greatest offensive lineman in the history of football. When talking about the prowess of Pace is when I first heard the term Pancake, as in he would hit a defensive guy so hard that he would be flattened on the ground. Goofy ESPN even keeps stats on pancakes. Pancake reminds me of the sociologist in the 1970s whose main thesis was that football was fraught with latent homosexuality with terms such as gang tackling, sacking the QB, etc. I guess getting pancaked has a similar connotation.
