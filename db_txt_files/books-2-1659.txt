The fact that this strip is so popular depresses me more than anything else. It reflects office culture of the '90s the way Cathy did in the '80s... because of that, I feel Dilbert only appeals to a certain sector of society... unlike really great comics such as Calvin and Hobbes or the Far Side, which draw humor from human nature.
