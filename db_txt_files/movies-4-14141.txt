A wonderfully original plot and an interesting departure for Jim Carrey make this movie more than worth your while. The effects with the various tiny cameras were very cool, and Carrey played his trapped and desperate persona with perfect ease, topped off by a glorious and poignant ending. Go rent it and have a good time tonight.
