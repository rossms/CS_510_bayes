I got my 1998 Nissan Altima GXE in 2000. This has been the most trouble-free car I have ever owned. The biggest complaint is some road noise, but it is slight compared to some of my other cars. This car has consistently had better gas mileage than the specs stated. And there are so many standard perks on a Nissan; things that you actually have to pay lots of extra money for on other cars. This car could have a little more leg room in the back seat. This Altima has served us well. We will likely drive it until it falls apart, which will be many years to come.
