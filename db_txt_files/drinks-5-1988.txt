If you don't prefer the High Fructose Corn Syrup in most commercial green teas (like Arizona or Sobe) you'll loooove this tea. Green tea is supposed to be good for you and taste good - this one is just that! Get one right now - you won't regret it and you'll never go back to an unhealthier version!!! I want to buy it buy the case now that I've tried it :)
