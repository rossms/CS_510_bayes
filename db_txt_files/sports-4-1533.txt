Beat Atlanta twice in the '02 Division series. Should have won the deciding game of the World Series(pulled in the 7th with a 5-0 lead after giving up just 4 hits)if Dusty Baker hadn't thrown it all away. Don Sutton said the Angels players he talked to were stunned with the move. They were also thrilled with it. A .604 winning percentage in San Francisco, he is emerging as the ace of the Braves '03 staff. Control has always been a problem. Above average hitter for a pitcher. Giants fans will miss him.
