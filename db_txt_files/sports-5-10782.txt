I know of no other coaches who would buy fans camping out for tickets pizza as a show of thanks for their support for his team. Those of you who say he has done nothing without MV clearly don't understand. VT has gone from an afterthought at best in football when he arrived (at the start of probation caused by previous coach) to a conference champion in the BE and hopefully soon in the ACC. Ask Miami what sort of team FB puts on the field year in and year out.
