The best candy bar out there. I've loved this ever since I was little, when my school bus driver would hand me one each time I debarked from the bus. I think he did it in apology for forgetting to drop me off once, but a kid doesn't remember much when given a Reese's. I love these things, especially eating around the edges and then eating that creamy middle. . . Mmm, I might have to pick one of those up tomorrow. . .
