Saw this movie as a kid when it first came out. LOVED IT. Even my dad, who never saw movies twice, asked my sister and I if we wanted to stay in the theatre to see it again. He liked Gene Wilder's performances. We used to make little Oompa Loompa chocolate candies and sing the little song.... "What do you get when your child is a brat? Acting just like a Siamese cat!" As far as being mean spirited, Wonka wasn't mean to any of the kids, they did it to themselves, that was the point. Personal Responisibility.
