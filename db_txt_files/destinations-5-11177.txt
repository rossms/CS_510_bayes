Manteca was the best vacation that you can ever take. Its even better than going to New York for the first time, i've been going there since i was three not i'm fifteen and want to con. what i've started. Me and my cousin wanted to go last summer of 2004, but they told us it was closing that made me quite sad that we can't go no more.
