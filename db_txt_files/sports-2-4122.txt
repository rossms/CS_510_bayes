Diddle is great only when measured against the second tier of coaches and teams. Western Kentucky managed great success under Diddle but due to its cross state rival never achieved national prominence. He loved WKU but having coached there his entire career limited his talent level and ability to win the big games. On this list he cannot hang with the big boys when he failed to get even on NIT or NCAA title.
