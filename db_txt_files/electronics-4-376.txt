The DV-434 is the best among the DV series offering a progrssive scanning feature. Has an unbeatable price, MSRP for $450 (I found it for $280 online). Usually progressive players range anywhere from $500-$3000. Includes all your basic features (composite video, component video, S-video, analog audio outputs, fiber optic and coaxial digital audio outputs). Only bad thing is that it has no THX certification.
