The Chevy Lumina was a crappy car. It was designed to be bigger than Cavalier. Its biggest credit is with the Monte Carlo, for helping to ruin it. At the time, Monte Carlo's used to be nothing more than 2 door Lumina's. Reliability is bad, and interior materials were crappy. Resale values are low. Engines just couldn't compete with the rest of the class. In time, it was replaced by the much better Impala.
