With the U.S. vs Iraq 2 looming overhead, Powell was the first to seek diplomacy to find a solution to this conflict. He has since changed his tune (under extreme pressure from the administration no doubt) I still believe he desires a peaceful solution to this problem despite what he says on television to the American public and I commend anyone who chooses diplomacy before aggressivness.
