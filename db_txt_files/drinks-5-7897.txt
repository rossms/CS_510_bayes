I have never had Crown Royal or not that I know of but this weekend I had a Crown Royal and coke and it was delicious. First I saw the, oh so classy purple sack that it comes in which was a little intimidating. It is very smooth. I usually opt for a Gin and Tonic but the Crown Royal was so tasty that I couldn't resist. I don't think I would ever bust out at a bar and request a Crown Royal and coke but if it's there, why not?
