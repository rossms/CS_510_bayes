Nick Collison is going to be one of the greatest COLLEGE basketball players to ever play. He knows the fundamentals and isnt a showoff. About the NBA, he could surprise me but unless he starts taking steroids to make him taller he may not be as great as he's hyped up to be. But hey, it gives Kansas another great guy to brag about.
