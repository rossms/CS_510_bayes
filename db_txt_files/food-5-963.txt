Target had this unbelievable deal on this the other day - something in the neighborhood of about $3 for two boxes and some exercise CD. I thought, oh well, sure why not; low cal and tons of it so I threw it in my cart. I tried it and it really is good! It has a somewhat sweet taste, is very crunchy and doesn't go soft after the first 30 seconds. I'm not a big cereal fan for the most part, but this one already ranks up there with my few old favorites.
