One of the better Bond films to come out in some time. A lot of action, it never really stops. The cars are great as are the gadgets. Acting is not bad but it is a Bond film so who cares. The worst part of the movie is the opening credits with Madona's terrible theme song. It has to be the worst Bond theme yet.
