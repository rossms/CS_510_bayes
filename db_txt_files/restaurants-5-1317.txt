Arby's is the Rodney Dangerfield of the fast food world, it just can never get any respect. The chicken sandwiches and the curly fries are great there. It's good to see that they have something more than just fried foods here. The market-fresh sandwiches are pretty good. The sides are also decent as well. The jalapeno poppers with the raspberry sauce is good. The mozzerella sticks are also great as are the chicken fingers. All around great food, although it's a buck or two more expensive than Wendy's or McDonalds, but it's worth the price.
