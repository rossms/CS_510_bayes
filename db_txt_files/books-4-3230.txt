Very well done dystopian tale of the future: or is it a parable of the present? He wrote it in 85' if I remember correctly yet today in 02' it is more true to the state of our culture then ever. A tad negative so stay away if you don't like it when the Olson twins don't get what they want. Fantastic man against the system type of idea!
