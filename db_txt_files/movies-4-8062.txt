This film was amusing and worth the price of admission. There was something in it to entertain all ages. I saw it twice, the second time to try and figure out what I must have missed the first time that makes it worthy of the cult status it has achieved. I didn't figure it out the second time, either. It's a cute film, but not cute enough to become a classic.
