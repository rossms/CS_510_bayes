Burger King edges out past McDonalds for several reasons, but that's not to say it doesn't have its downsides. First, their chicken sandwiches and tenders are good and not processed like McDonalds. Their french fries also beat McDonalds and are very good. Fountain drinks are good as well as other food. However, their service is typically slower than others. Another good thing, however, is their expansive 99 cents menu for chompers on a budget :)
