A definite rating of 5! A wonderful store with a great layout. They might be large, but everywhere you turn a map is there to guide you. The sales associates are always helpful, courteous and informed. They have an effecient gift wrapping - customer service department. Not to mention, that they also have clothes for every member of your family including the hard to please teenager all the way to the weight challanged aunt or uncle. Oh, and their sales are to die for. A great place to shop if friendliness and a good deal are important to you!
