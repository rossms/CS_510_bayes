Motley often gets overlooked as a hair band which is really unfair. The only reason there was a hair movement is because every label wanted the next Motley Crue Although Shout At The Devil may not be their most succesful album, it was the album that set the standard for which heavy metal is measured. It made heavy metal commercially viable, while keeping intact it's dangerous side. A lot of today's popular bands credit that album for inspiring them the way yesterday's generation credits Black Sabbath. Truly a timeless metal album!
