Not the best, but seems like the trendiest. I went in a A F store for the first time at Christmas and I think I was the oldest person in there! I liked a couple of thier items but when I looked at the prices, I remembered that when I was in highshool that the prices are set that way because the kids love the clothes and the parents have the money. Anyway, the moral is don't take your kids to A F unless you have money to burn! Sorry.. not worth it.
