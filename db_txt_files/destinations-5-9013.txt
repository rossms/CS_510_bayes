They say that man fears time, but time fears the pyramids. Built during the 4th Dynasty (Old Kingdom) in Egypt, the pyramids of Giza include the oldest and sole surviving wonder of the ancient world. How could anyone not want to see these fascinating buildings, testaments to man's (some say) obsession with death and a possible afterlife, with the Sphinx to boot (the origins of which probably predate the pyramids).
