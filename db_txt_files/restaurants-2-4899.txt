Like many slow food, sit down dining chains, this one is drab, boring and very slow. The inside of the structure is dark, drab and lifeless with very few windows to be found. Also, you have to wait 10 minutes to be served and another 10 to get your food! (Compare that to the typical 2 minutes from order to serving of coolicious fast food!) As with all sit down chains, the prices are insane. But, at least, the chicken fingers and french fries are passable (but, of course, can't compare to the masterful chicken that is Chick-Fil-A!).
