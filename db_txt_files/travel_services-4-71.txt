Pros: Excellent low fares, nice leather seats, freindly staff, several destinations Cons: Worst frequent flyer program - miles expire quickly (after 1 year I believe)! Miles really don't add up compared to other frequent flyer programs (I rank Alaska Airlines program the best). I use Southwest primarily for the $39 one-way fares (if choosing to go to other cities during vacations).
