as of right now jack's very good at what he does....[what he does= he takes roles and fills them to the gills...busting out even making something out of nothing]....shallow hal was crap without him then qwenith paltrow...totally carried the film. Yeah, he's type cast but he's given some responsibility with the soft spots.....like romance in hal and teaching/molding minds in school of rock! I dislike comedies but it takes genius to capture me his acting/type cast roles certainly do!
