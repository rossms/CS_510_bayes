OK, to start i drink heavily, and borderline constatnly. Therefore price matters, yet i still like my alcohol to be pleaseing. For the price there is no better vodka period, you can;t deny that. There are better vodkas: Grey Goose etc but whith heavty prices almost 10$ more in most circumstances; I can honestly say 3 olives is well worth the 10$ saved.
