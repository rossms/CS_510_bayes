This movie came at me in SHOCKING 2-D. The elements of a masterpiece were at the fingertips of director Friedkin, but he fumbled. Jackson and Jones were too intense for their own good, since nothing else going on could match or even counter their shouting and rage. My favorite scene, which I thought showed the most development and excitement and humor was the scene in which the two heros get into a drunk fight. That was tasty.
