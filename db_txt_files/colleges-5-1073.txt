Outstanding university, but there's no laxitude here -- you work, work, work. Still -- you learn, learn, learn, and every job you'll have in the future will seem like a cakewalk, and every boss will be easily intimidated by your knowledge and confidence. Conrell is a great place, but it's not for the faint of heart or the lazy of mind. If you want to sleepwalk, go to Harvard instead.
