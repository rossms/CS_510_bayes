The Bucs have proven they are the team to beat. Thier defense is the same great defense we have seen for the last couple of years but the offense of Sean King and Keyshaun is making them the elite team in the NFL. Instead of winning games 14-10, they are now blowing opponents out of the water. King is playing like a veteran QB, and not forcing the stupid mistakes, becuz he knows he has the defense to back him up as long as these errors are avoided. The only question is who are they going to play in the Superbowl.
