Basically agree with ryper. First book is as good as Sc-Fi gets and it went steadily down from there. However, this is not a rating of the series but of the book Dune itself, which can only get the highest rating possible. For an even faster pace, but probably a little bit less of the religious aspects of Dune (which helped make it great) check out the prequels. The House Atreides, Harkonnen and Corrino are tremendous and the much earlier in time Butlerian Jihad, Machine Crusade and Battle of Corrin are just good.
