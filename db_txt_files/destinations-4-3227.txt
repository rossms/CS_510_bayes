San Diego is a nice city, but it should be noted that most of the interesting stuff to see and do are in the suburbs of the city. The city itself has nothing much to speak of. The climate is perfect, average temps. are about 60-70 every month; it never gets too hot or too cold. It has nice people as well. You have the mountains, desert, and beaches all very close nearby. I wouldn't mind moving here.
