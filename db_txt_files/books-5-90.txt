This book took a little time to read, but it was worth every second. This book is really well written and gives you great insight into Mick Foley's life and his wrestling career. Mick Foley was already my favourite wrestler before I read the book, but reading Have A Nice Day! gave me a new appreciation for him and all that he did throughout his career. This book also gives you a behind the scenes look at pro wrestling federations and just how much of it is real and how much of it is fake. Definitely worth the read.
