Potential is another way of saying it hasnt been done. Rutgers has potential being a State school in a State chock full of div-1 caliber players. The facilities are good and they play in a high profile league. This should add up to much better teams than we've seen from them. Best to lay the blame on the AD's and the coaches who were hired by them. What a shame. It could be so much better.
