I've always liked her. Unfortunately, her choice of material has rarely equaled the potential I see in her. She is very good in everything she does, but I thing some of the unchallenging roles she takes are holding her back. Very singular beauty, although she did seem to resemble Helen Hunt when she was younger. but now she's developed her own very fetching look. Not to mention one of the sexiest voices of any current actress. After a very prolific period these last couple years, she seems to be taking a break. Let's hope she comes back with something amazing.
