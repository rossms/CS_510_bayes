I'm at Fort Riley, KS. When we got back from Iraq, my buddies and I got broadband for our barracks rooms. I'm on the 3 Mbps plan, and everything worked great for about a month or so. Then about 4 weeks ago the connection fell to dial-up speeds. Only during certain times of the day will we get fast connections, then it's back to 49-100Bps connection. Charter has done ZERO to fix the issue and continue to change their stories. They won't refund us and they're the only service provider here on Post. These guys are screwing a lot of people over--including soldiers returning from Iraq!
