Word on the street is that this guy's back in the office. He's a bright guy and modeled his strategy after the great Billy Beane (not bad footsteps to follow) but I was surprised at his exit this Halloween. He left Fenway Park in a gorilla costume because he didn't want to get mobbed by the media. I wonder if he will play second fiddle to the two guys who took over for him. I also wonder Luccini will step out of the picture a little, because that seems to be what drove him out in the first place.
