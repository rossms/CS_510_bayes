United will probably always be my favorite out of the group. Not only are the ticket agents really down to earth and polite, but I almost always have great experiences with the flight attendants. Very helpful, and are always sincere when it comes to safety...which is a huge plus. I am always offered at least 2 beverages during a 4 hour flight, where alot of other airlines barely give you half a can of soda during a long flight ! I have always left and arrived on time every time I have used United. They are a little expensive, but totally worth it. The best American airline available ! Superb !
