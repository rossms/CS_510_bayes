I was surpised how much I liked it when I visited. It isn't really a city in any traditional sense, but it is a nice sleepy town in an awesome setting if you like the outdoors. As a visitor, I was impressed by how nice the people are and how safe I felt. Great skiing nearby in Park City. I'm not sure if it is really a city, but it definitely deserves a higher ranking on this list- seriously, the outdoor setting alone puts it well about 90% of the cities on this list.
