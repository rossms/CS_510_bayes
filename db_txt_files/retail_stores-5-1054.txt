Although Abercrombie seems so mainstream and overrated, I think their style is revolutionary (in terms of casual clothes) - if you ever take a look at one of their catalogs, it is almost like an art magazine - the outfits are almost crossing the line (in terms of color groupings) but not quite - thats what makes it revolutionary.
