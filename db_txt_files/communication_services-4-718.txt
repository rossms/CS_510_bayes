I have been w/ sprint 4 years now and I like the phones and the new plans but the customer service is horrible. Sprint has made a lot of changes for the better but they need some new service people and watch your bill for overages they seem to have issues with that. One thing I can tell you is have patients with them because I didn't and was hung up on quite a bit. LMAO The sanyo phones are the best I had a lot of trouble with the samsung phones. Flip phones are worse the the others they have more issues. I have the 8200 and I love it.
