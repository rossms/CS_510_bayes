It took a while for me to fully appreciate my time spent at MSU and Bozeman. Comparing my college experience with others I believe that MSU stacks up with the best. This includes colleagues who attended Berkley and Harvard. I want to add that hands down Bozeman is one of the coolest college town ... I would give my left leg to go back.
