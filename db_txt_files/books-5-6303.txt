A book with tremendous insight and thought. The humor/satire adds much as well.I find it interesting that the people who are so outspoken against Rush and his book are the very ones who demonstrate what true evil and abuse of power is. Civil Rights apply only to their ideals, freedom of speech is only applicable to their voices and insensitivity applies ONLY to right-wing extremists .....go figure.
