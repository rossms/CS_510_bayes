Say what you want about Spurrer (arrogant, cocky, etc.) but he played by the rules and he won with style. I didn't go to University of Florida by I always respected their team because they had fun playing football. Yes, they were cocky, but that was awesome. In the 90's, what game would you rather see than FSU-UF? That was THE GAME. That is just my opinion.
