Ok I love golf so much that I go at least three times a week. My roomate and I just recently went to Las Vegas and golfed on some of the coures. The courses were awesome! I found this site called www.vegasfreedom.com and they have info and a brochure on all of the Las Vegas golf courses. Check out the site and let me know what you think? Have you ever golfed in Las Vegas?
