WHENEVER I TOOK ANY OF MY NIECES OR NEPHEWS TO CHUCK E CHEESE, IT ALL WENT THE SAME EXACT WAY: THEY HAVE A GREAT TIME RUNNING AROUND PLAYIN WITH ALL THE KIDDIE CRAP THE PLACE HAS TO OFFER. THEY EAT THE FOOD, BUT AS SOON AS CHUCK COMES OUT WITH THE OTHER BAND OF ANIMALS, THEY WERE FRIGHTENED BIGTIME TO THE POINT OF TEARS. THINK ABOUT IT, WHO'S IDEA WAS IT TO MAKE A GIANT RODENT A MASCOT FOR A KIDS PLACE? LOL
