Yep...he was on some bad teams, but we're not ranking teams here. Throwing no-hitters is the single greatest individual effort a peron can contribute to a team win (as long as one of your other 8 guys crosses the plate). He not only PLAYED through THREE DECADES, he FIRED BULLETS through them! Great competitor, athelete and gentleman.
