The Ateneo MBA is coming up with a subject that shall encompass ethics and social philosophy with the aim of producing a graduate that is distinctively Atenean ..... We could guess that the core value shall be MAN FOR OTHERS for the GREATER GLORY OF GOD - a teaching the Ateneo has been known since 1859..... Note: Jose Rizal, the Philippines' national hero, graduated from the Ateneo.
