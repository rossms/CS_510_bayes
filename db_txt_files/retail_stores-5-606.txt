They are really great. The Company really cares about costumer service and what the customers want. I can always find something a little different and fresh at a good price, compared to A F and other retailers. I enjoy the Clothing especially the jeans and some great kinda rock and rool meets Western style shirts, Great shoes and also comfy tees. AE really lasts, I guess you get what you pay for, or don't- only at A F.
