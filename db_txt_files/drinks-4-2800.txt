Folgers-Classic Roast instant coffee is decent for being 'instant.' The granules are natural looking: small, dark, and fresh. Notwithstanding the slightly cereal flavor, the taste is full and rich and dark and the aroma is great. Also, a decent caffeine 'high' for being instant. Recommended along with Nescafe's instant types. Steer away from Tasters Choice and Maxwell House sh*t.
