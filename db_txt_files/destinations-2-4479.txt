I used to like living in the area. The area has little in the way of personality any more. Lots of business transient workers come and go, and there is lots of uncontrolled sprawl. Just a lot of highways and the same chain stores you seen anywhere. There are still some unique and colorful spots, but Atlanta is no longer Southern in character or demographics. Traffic is awful and getting worse. The job market here is not what it used to be. Apparently a magnet for homosexuals and for Third World immigrants who do not want to learn the language or American hygiene habits.
