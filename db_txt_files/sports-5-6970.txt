I'm an old-school LAKERS SHOWTIME fan (not kobe/shaq version - they're a joke & their 3 championship rings are a farce!!!) THANKS DETROIT! But anyways...back to the 80's....BIRD was INSANE....hated him then (can't blame me). He shot the ball like he was unconcious. Mentaly, Bird was INDOMITABLE!!!He was 'FUNDAMENTAL' in the era when everyone was fundamental. ROOKIE B-ball fans today have NO COMPREHINSION of how good the BIRD-MAN was!
