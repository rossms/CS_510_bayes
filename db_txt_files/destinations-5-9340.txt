I LOVE BERMUDA!!!!! Beautiful place! Must visit Hamilton if you visit. There isn't much to do in the dockyard, but you can just take a moped over to the other parts of the island. It is easily accessible. There are ferries buses as well to transport you through out the island. It's so peaceful relaxing! Pink sand beaches. Like I said, I love BERMUDA!
