Bought a Dodge Ram 1500 quad door sport in 2000 and have loved it since day 1. Have had only one problem with it the entire time i've had it. The heating element died in the side mirrors but was after I had the truck for almost 3 years. Will NEVER touch a ford or chevy. The only trucks I will buy are dodge's.
