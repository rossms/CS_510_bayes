I may be more wrong than right but Lisa Kudrow seems like a one dimensional actress. Her role in Friends as the ditzy Phoebe seems to have solidified the audience's perception of her as an airhead in REAL life. Perhaps that's why the characters she portrayed in such movies as Romy and Michelle's High School Reunion and Lucky Numbers bore striking resemblances to her TV persona. I don't think any movie director would consider approaching Lisa for a serious movie role in a drama. It would be nice if Lisa could show us her intelligent side, don't be shy!
