Hey i aggree burgers are good. I say the spicy chicken sandwich aslo good, its pretty equivalent to wendys when maid right. The fries are ok, but noone can beat mcdonalds. The only con is they could be a little cleaner so thats why I gave them a four star and not a five. All in all definetly come back if you havent been in a while, their new menu has some pretty good stuff!
