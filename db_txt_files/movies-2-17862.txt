Based on a truly terrifying novel, a wild and excellent performance from Mr. Nicholson, thats the plus side. Shelly Duvall Scatman Crothers gave two of the WORST performances ever captured on film, hysterically bad !! Kubrick tried too hard to make an artsy film, almost worked, but mostley made it look glossy fake. A few genuine scares, but the bad out weighs the good in this film.
