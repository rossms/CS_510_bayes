I'm a soda freak! This is my favorite soda! We don't have it at the theatre, so I always go down to the Subway for a large Dr. Pepper! Everyone's always like, Why do you go buy soda, if you get it here for free? I'm like, Duh.. because we don't have Dr. Pepper! If it's not DP though, I settle for the Pink Lemonade at work!
