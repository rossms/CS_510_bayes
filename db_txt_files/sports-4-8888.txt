Peja is always one of my favorite players, esp. since the Kings are my favorite team. I love his past and what he's done. He left his home b/c of war and didn't start playing basketball at all until like 13 i think... and ended up playing professionally at age 16. He's incredible, even if he did leave me disappointed in this year's playoffs.
