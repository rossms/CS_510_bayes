Despite minor quibbles over the years, I've enjoyed most every meal there. Sometimes you just need a good down home dinner with the kinds of comfort food that is Cracker Barrel's specialty. I especially like the fresh biscuits and delicious cornbread that accompany dinner. For sit-down service, their meals are among the better values you can find.
