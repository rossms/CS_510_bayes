Definately one of the best passers in college basketball, great shooter from beyond the arc, and creates for his teammates if his shot isn't on. Stepp had a rough tournament shooting but still created offense for his teammates with his pinpoint passes. Probably the best player to come out of Gonzaga since John Stockton. Will most definately go in the NBA Draft probably late first round or early second.
