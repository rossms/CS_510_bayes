A very dangerous weapon. May be the most exciting QB in the league, because he'll hurt you in so many ways. He has a power arm, and can take off and run if he's in trouble. At this stage, though, he's more physical than cerebral. He struggles to read defenses, he'll lock onto his primary reciever, take too many sacks, force passes. Once he becomes acclamated to the NFL, he'll be very scary.
