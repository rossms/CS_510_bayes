Michael Jordan - the quintessential Bball player of his time. Compare him to Wilt? You really can't do that. Wilt was great for his time but he never had the quickness and agility of the more recent players. If you love Bball, I don't have to give you a list of the best. But Mike was just a touch above the crown! He was wonderful to watch and always gave us something to cheer about!
