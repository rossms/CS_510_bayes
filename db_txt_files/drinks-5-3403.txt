I love Twisted Tea! I have been drinking it for about 3 years now. I hate beer, so when Twisted Tea came onto the market, I thought, maybe I will like that. And sure enough, I love it! The half & half is my favorite, but the regular is just as good. I hope they keep making it. It has become very popular here in Maine.
