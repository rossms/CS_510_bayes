The pier accommodates three giant cruise ships so that about 4500 new tourists can visit about a hundred tourist shops every day. The scenery is dull, as is the whole chain of Keys. One truly good reason for visiting Key West is to take advantage of fishing, diving, and water sports. They have lots and lots of beautiful clear tropic water. The warm winter weather is suitable to being totally idle. That's about it. The local high school teams are The Conchs -- I guess they admire persistence rather than speed.
