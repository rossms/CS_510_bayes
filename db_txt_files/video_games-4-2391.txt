Well Lucas Arts took just about the only good thing out of Episode I and turned it into a video game. When I got the game I could not put it down and even after beating it I still play every now and then. The graphics are great, environment unique, and the controls are adequate. It is one of the best racing games next to MarioKart and Wave Race.
