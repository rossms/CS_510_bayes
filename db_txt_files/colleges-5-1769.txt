I spent some of the best years of my life at Virginia Tech. The school has it all-- great academics, hard working students who also know how to party, and a beautiful setting in a college town. For those reading the negative comments, don't worry. They're just bitter UVA grads who will never give VT the credit for what it really is-- a great school!
