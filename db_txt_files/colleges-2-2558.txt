A campus that looks like Disneyland (no two buildings look alike) and a staff that engages in way too much public infighting. They had a basketball coach who proved to be the most corrupt in NCAA history. And they scraped some of their professors from the bottom of the barrel. But if you work hard, you can be a big academic fish in a little pond. Free advice: Find the best prof in your department of choice and become his/her indentured servant. Quality is scarce in a lot of places and here is no exception. But a savvy student can make it work to advantage. That's what I did.
