No, she's not Britney Spears. Which is a good thing. But she's also not spectacularly good--she's like a lower-content version of Alanis. Which might give her somewhat more staying power--as opposed to the new 2000 version of the 80s mall girl. But there are a lot of people out there who're better. On the whole, she's going to be forgotten by her adolescent fans when they grow up. And the person commenting on not criticizing should probably stop looking at rating sites. At any rate, it's a passable listen, but not worth the money. Download the MP3s instead.
