This is a series which has continued to improve with every release, starting with a fairly trad comic fantasy approach, particularly in the first two and quickly becoming a mirror of the modern world. This is where the discword gains the majority of its humor and this coupled with Pratchetts imaginative plots, easy writing style and superlative cast of characters makes for a brilliant series.
