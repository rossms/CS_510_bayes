I dont know what wins5238om is talking about I can see why he/she did not like the first 2 but the 3rd one was awesome and then the scoins of shanbara was even better. I love how he took the world of the first shannara trilogy and completly changed it. How I am not going to say for those readers that come on here to find good books to read. IF you are one of those people I think you chould read this series if you like SF at all and start at the first book it sets the other ones up.
