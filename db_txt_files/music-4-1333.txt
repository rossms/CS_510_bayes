I heard the song "Where is my Mind?" on a college radio station years ago and fell in love with it. Eventually, I hunted down this CD. I wasn't as enamored of the other songs on it, but it's grown on me with time. Particularly like "Bone Machine." Anyone who tries something a bit different as an artist, and succeeds on their own terms, always has a measure of my respect, even if I can't qualify myself as a "fan."
