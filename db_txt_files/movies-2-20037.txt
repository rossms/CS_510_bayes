A very bad and very overrated movie. I can't believe it isn't down at the bottom of the pack. There was very little fright in this movie and there were no funny scenes to speak of. When I see a horror movie, it gets added points for comedic effect and this had none. Turned out to be a dud of a horror movie, so typical of the last 5-10 years.
