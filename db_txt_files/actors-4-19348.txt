Yes he is a GREAT actor in FRIENDS he's my second choice (NO ONE CAN BEAT MATTHEW PERRY!) on FRIENDS he is VERY funny and cute! his stupidness is what makes people laugh and that's great acting! but in his movies...lets not go their cuz it ain't to good!...ANYway I just have to say FRIENDS rules it's the best show on TV, and long live Chandler Bing!!!
