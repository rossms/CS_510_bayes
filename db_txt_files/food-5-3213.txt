These meals are terrific. They provide choices others don't and they taste like home cooking. I just finished the honey roasted chicken and it was finger licking good. The price I think is reasonable also especially when compared with McDonalds junk. And convenient- you cannot beat them. You can stock up and when you don't feel like cooking or stopping for take out you can go straight home kick off your shoes and throw one in the microwave. Bone appetite!
