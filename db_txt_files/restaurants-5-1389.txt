I went to the sonic in bonham tx when they were really busy the food came fresh although it took a while but they appologized for the wait. Plus the manager is really nice. If you have a complaint, she'll make the food fresh, free of charge, and if the order takes more than ten minutes and you ask about you'll get it free also. The only problem i had was they didnt salt their fries.
