Siesta Key, a barrier island adjacent to Sarasota, is one of the best beaches in America by general acclaim. I spent a week there and certainly agree: the whitest and finest sand you will ever see plus little overcrowding most of the year make this an excellent place to vacation or overwinter. And nearby Siesta Village has good restaurants, friendly people and fun gift shops.
