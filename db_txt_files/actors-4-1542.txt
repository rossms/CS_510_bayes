I like Morgan Freeman but I'm somewhat ambivalent about him. He's a terrific actor but most all of his really substantive roles, with the exception of Lean on Me, have been in supporting parts (Glory, Unforgiven, Se7en...). I'd love to see a great film built around his character. I don't know if he's done any stage work but I'd like to see him in a stage production as well.
