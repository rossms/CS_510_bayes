Coming from an Italian family, I know good pasta when I taste it. And the pasta at the Olive Garden is hand-made, never frozen. I love the breadsticks and the salad, with a tangy Italian dressing that is perfectly mouth-watering. The environment is relaxing and maybe even a little romantic, the food is excellent.
