Taco Johns has excellent food, and I have always had excellent service while there. No matter what time of day I go there, I am greeted by friendly people who seem to care about their jobs. My favorite item is the Super Combination Burrito. It's got olives, tomatoes, Sour cream and lettuce. Really excellent. Some people say Taco John's isn't any good, but I think it's way better than most of the greasy burger places.
