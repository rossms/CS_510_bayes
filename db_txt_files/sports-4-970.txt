I like Edmonds a lot. He is a great center fielder (even if he does milk his diving catches to make them look better). He has proven with the Angels and now the Cardinals that he can hit for average and power. The biggest knock against him as always been injuries. He seems to break down every season and this has cost him a lot with his teammates who think that he is a very selfish player. That may be true, but he is an exciting player for the fans.
