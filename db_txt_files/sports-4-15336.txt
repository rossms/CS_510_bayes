Once the best QB in football, injuries and a lack of recievers have taken a toll on him. He's got a real rocket of an arm. He'll squeeze it in small gaps and make big plays. He's great when on the move. He's at his best when in a sandlot-like situation, where he scrambles, freelances, makes plays. His mechanics and footwork have gone to hell in recent years, so he's much less accurate than the MVP years. He's also too impulsive, he'll try to do too much, and he'll force throws at times.
