I had one of these a couple of nights ago and even though I know I've had it before I must've forgotten or else I would've ordered one everytime I've eaten Mexican food. Quite tastey. Smooth, amber, not nearly as light as a Corona but not to heavy either. Really a very pleasant and enjoyable drink. I was quite surprised.
