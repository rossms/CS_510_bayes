Regardless if it was based on a fictional tail of a meteor hitting and destroying earth, it had too much drama and suspense. It posted a 2 for just the effort. The movie had no science fiction basis, but more of a symbolic love story. You cannot replace a fantasy setting for a dating game; it's just not right. The movie should've given a more imaginary and adventurous sense.
