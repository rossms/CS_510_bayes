This vid has a nice touch! The meaning of the song is sweet. I like the scene with the little tower thingy and the whole viddy has a nice misty feel to it. I like that song and I did hear a different version to it that sounded cool. the part where he was in the water was a good extra to the vid too. I like the vid and the song, a very nice mix of the real meaning (his baby)and a fantasy world.
