Not their best, not their most punk, but they still ROCK and Staring At The Sun is an awesome song. Anyone wanting punk might not like it- they should get Ignition or The Offspring instead- but stop trying to make it fit into a punk stereotype and just accept it for what it is...VERY GOOD MUSIC!!! ;)
