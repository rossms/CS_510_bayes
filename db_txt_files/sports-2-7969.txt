Iverson gets an extra star because he is a good player. However, he needs to learn when to pass the ball. Several times I have seen him waste time charging to the basket, trying to score over big men. What an idiot, he's like, 6'2 or under! He could be so much more if he had more Bball IQ, but his attitude shows he is more of a liability than an asset. CWebb is a small help, but he's not what he used to be...in college.
