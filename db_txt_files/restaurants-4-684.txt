I've never actually attended this place, but I've had a doughnut from there. I kid you not, it melted in my mouth! Like cotton candy! SOO delicious. I hear that people drive an hour and wait in line to get these doughnuts. I'm waiting for the day that I can get the full Krispy Kreme experience, and I'm not even very into doughnuts.
