Good TITANIC/PRIVATE RYAN hybrid. To tell you the honest truth, I really liked Pearl Harbor believe it should be given alot more credit than the critics have been doing. It may not have the emotional jolt it should have, but still it has some juice in it. Alot of people argue that there are too many typical Hollywood cliches in the film, but let me ask you, what film DOESN'T have typical Hollywood cliches these days? I don't care what anyone else says, I think it's a good movie!
