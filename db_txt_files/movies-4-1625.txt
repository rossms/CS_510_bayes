Very good movie. Very disturbing movie. If you are one of those people that gets a little queasy when watching movies that have some gruesome scenes, be ready to cover your eyes for a couple of parts of 'Seven'. I think that Brad Pitt, Morgan Freeman and Kevin Spacey all did great jobs in the movie. The plot was not really intricate, but interesting enough to make you want to keep following the twists of the movie to see where it turns next.
