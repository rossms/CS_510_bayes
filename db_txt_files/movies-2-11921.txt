If it weren't for Goldie Hawn, I'd give The Banger Sisters one star. It's simply a bad movie on all levels. The plot is slow, depressing, and trite. There is a lot of sleaze and crummy behavior, and it lacks the humor that can sometimes make that combination bearable. The one high point was Goldie Hawn's performance, but that alone does not warrant seeing the movie. This one's not even worth renting.
