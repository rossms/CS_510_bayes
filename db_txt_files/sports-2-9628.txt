The Heat are nothing more than an athletic cast thrown together-much like the Yankees of baseball. Shaq is hurt half the time, and teams like Detroit have already proven they can handle him. Sure, the Heat have other scorers like Wade, but the rest of them are no better than any of the other starting five in the league. Scoring AND defense wins championships,and frankly, I don't see any D on the Heat. Flashy, yes, but prone to burnout in the long run. Not much to fear from Miami these days.
