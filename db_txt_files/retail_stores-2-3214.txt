Never have the movies in your queue. Went over a week without receiving a single movie. Wrote customer and made a complaint that I was going to cancel my membership because of poor service. All of a sudden 4 movies are sent out (my membership is for 3). Still leaving. Very slow to ship, if you can't get any movies in your Q. Same day a movie comes out it's listed as short or long wait.
