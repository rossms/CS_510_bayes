America didn't deserve a great man like Jimmy Carter. One of America's greatest champions of human rights, this country blamed him for circumstances beyond his control: inflation and interest rates caused by high foreign oil prices (encouraged by Henry Kissenger) and a bunch of lunatic Iranians. At least he will be remembered as our greatest ex-president.
