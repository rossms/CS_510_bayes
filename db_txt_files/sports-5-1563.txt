As dominating a pitcher as there is in the league. His delivery is effortless, and his fasball seems to speed up as it approaches the plate. He rarely seems to catch more than a corner of the plate with a pitch, as his control is absolutely awesome when you consider how hard he is throwing.... and then there is the curve ball. Javy Lopez struck out on a pitch tonight that must have bounced ten feet in front of, and 2 feet to the left of the plate. A scary, scary pitcher.
