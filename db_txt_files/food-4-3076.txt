A cookie is just a cookie, but Newtons are fruit and cake... well, I still see them as cookies, but they're good cookies. Well... I suppose the main question is, do you like fruit in cookies? If so, perhaps you'd like these little treats. Otherwise... well, just get regular non-fruit filled cookies.
