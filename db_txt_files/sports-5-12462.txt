In the last 4 seasons no one has a better record than Miami. That success has not translated into championships. The BCS format has hurt Miami more than almost any program over the past 4 seasons. 46 wins and only 4 losses. Playing in the Big East means most of those wins are gimmes but Miami has beaten the better teams when they did play them. Slightly over rated given how many easy wins they had each season.
