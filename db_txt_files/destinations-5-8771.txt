After about a year of trying every dip on the market, i have found the best to be copenhagen. I used to be a skeptic of copenhagen because it had no variety of flavors like skoal, which is what I used to dip. But after buying my first can of Cope, i will never dip anything else. Great buzz, great taste, great dip.
