Of players in the 90s, I'd put him just behind Pippen and just ahead of Jordan. I know, Hakeem and Pippen couldn't win a title together, but: 1) Both Hakeem and Pippen were a little past their primes at that point. 2) It was a shortened season which doesn't really count. 3) No two star players have won a title in their first year together (West/Chamberlain, Pippen/Jordan, Frasier/Monroe, Shaq/Kobe, etc); star players need at least a full season together to learn how to play off each other. If Pippen had stayed...
