Grant Hill is a very likeable player, and a very fundamentally sound player. One of the elite players of the league, he is not. There has been a lot of talk in Philadelphia recently that Allan Iverson isn't enough of a leader to make the Sixers a contender, and that they should get rid of him and try and get Grant Hill. What has Grant Hill done? With arguably a better supporting cast (and definitely better scorers), the Pistons are perennial first round casualties. This is not a knock on Grant Hill, this is praise to Iverson.
