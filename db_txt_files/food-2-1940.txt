Bit-o-Honey good lord I don't think I've had one of these in at least 10 years! Thinking back they were pretty good but a little too much of a nutty, almost peanut buttery, taste for me. Sticky and chewy they really worked out your jaw but now they conjure up an image of tooth picking on par with a candy such as ju-ju B's (sp?)Which are just too demanding for a candy.
