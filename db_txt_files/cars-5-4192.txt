Got it to replace a Suburban. The Honda EX-L is not quite a big inside, but the seating is more versatile. The vehicle has less than 1500 miles on it, mostly on a trip across WA state and back. On the 800 mile round trip we averaged 28.6 mpg one way and 25.6 mpg the other way. This was through the Cascade mountains and through Seattle at or above the posted speed limits. The Suburban would have got a little under 15 mpg for this trip.
