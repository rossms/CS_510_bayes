The key to a successful New York City visit is planning. The Access New York Guide is the best I have found! Allow enough time for each attraction! For example if you are going to the Statue of Liberty allow at least 4-5 hours. Purchase Broadway tickets months in advance to classics like Les Miz, Phantom and Lion King.
