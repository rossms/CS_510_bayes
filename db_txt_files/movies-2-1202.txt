This movie was violent for no reason and the whole plot was violence. In this movie, killing people was supposed to be funny. But I didn't laugh at one thing, not even when they shot the guy when they went over the speed bump. It didn't deserve to win or be up for any Oscars. This is an over-rated movie about people who think murder and violence is funny.
