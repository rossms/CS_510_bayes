This movie continues to be a genuinely great movie to watch. It's a classic because already there are so many generations who've watched Grease and have loved it. The singing and dancing in the film is enjoyable. The lyrics are fun and memorable and often I catch myself singing Grease Lightning with friends at parties. The acting in the movie was terrific. John Travolta and Olivia Newton John rock. Grease is a classic time period. A musical that transcends trends.
