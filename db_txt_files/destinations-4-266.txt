Perth is a great town - Neat, tidy, orderly and without any big city hassles. Has an almost perfect climate throughout most of the year and some of the best urban beaches in Australia. Suffers from monotonous suburban sprawl, and downtown dies down after dark, but has a bit of everything to appeal to most tastes.
