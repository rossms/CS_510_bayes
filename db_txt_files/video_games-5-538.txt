The ultimate board game for budding capitalists. I started playing this game when I was in grade school, and over twenty years later I still enjoy it. Of course, somewhere in between, I had several encounters with 'Drinkopoly,' which is Monopoly's evil cousin. If you remember how a game of Drinkopoly ends, you're not playing right.
