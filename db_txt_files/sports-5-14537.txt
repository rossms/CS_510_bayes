This is my guy. He along with Dickerson has the best start of anyone in history for running backs. His first 5 years, he was simply unstoppable. But he simply ran out of gas. If you give me the choice of choosing any running back in history, i would take Earl Campbell in his prime. I know it was short but this guy put fear in the defense with his power. Not only that, he actually had speed too. He could run inside or outside.
