was a very very diappointing movie...i thought this movie wud give x2 some challenge..but it just didnt live up to its expextations..first of all the hulk came out too late...secondly the presentation and the split screen didnt work for this movie..thirdly the last fight between the hulk n his dad was very badly done ..no one had any idea what was goin on... i thot ang lee wud do a much better job..
