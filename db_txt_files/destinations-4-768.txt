Look real closely at that line dividing Canada from the USA. You will will realize that there is a really thin line between the sane and the insane. Notice how the roads suddenly become smoother and people are actually living in peaceful co-existence with one another. Some of my fellow Americans will say "It's too cold, up there". But that's just what it feels like after coming out of the cave you have been living in, for so long.
