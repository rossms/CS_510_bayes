I like any team that has a great history. From Teddy Ballgame to Yaz to Boggs to the World Series Champions, there is a rich history here. Heck, the left field wall in their park has more charecter than some teams have on their roster. Plus, we no longer have to hear about the Curse of the Bambino after last October.
