i think that she AND jennifer aniston just exist to make women feel bad about themselves....isnt the average female size really a size 16. women KNOW this skinny bitchy looking people like courtney cox are unattractive....gimme a woman any day who has trouble finding clothes in Old Navy and i'll be happy. PLus---Cox cant act--she's horrible and she screeches like a poor man's Margot Kidder when she talks. ooh--bashing the Friends cast is fun--Bring on David Schwimmer.
