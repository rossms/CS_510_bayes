Ok first off I have to tell you I work for Little Caesars in South East Michigan. Worked for little caesars for over four years. The pizza has changed alot, for instance, no more small medium extra large or giants. But the quality of pizzas (at least the ones made at my store) are well above average compared to any competitor in the area. A heaping 8 ounce cup of cheese, 30 pepperoni on every pizza. Only thing i dont like is they dont have the Pizza Pizza bags anymore, those were awesome!
