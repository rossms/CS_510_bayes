This guy should be at the top of the list. In three years he has turned the ABSOLUTE WORST TEAM IN THE NFL (from 1991-2002) into a SERIOUS contender for a Super Bowl championship. The Bengals are GOOD (and very watchable again). Coach Marvin Lewis has done a wonderful job. In fact, his new nickname is "Marvelous" Marvin Lewis.
