As a fellow Aussie, I suppose I should, perhaps, favour Crowe, but there's something about him I just don't like. His cockiness and self-importance really annoy me and I don't see what the fuss is about his acting abilities . He's okay, but there are much better Aussie actors who have got half the recognition of Crowe and deserve it. Crowe is nothing to crow about.
