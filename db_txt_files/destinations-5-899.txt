Today, 01/04/2002, the three most rated Western Europe attractions are in Madrid, Barcelona, Granada. There must be an explication. I'm far from being Spanish...and nevertheless I do think Spain (maybe also Portugal...) is the only country a non-native could fall in love with, because it's full of magic. Magic in the real meaning of...feeling the magic around you, and in you. And in the middle of all this, you find some of the most beatiful attractions the entire world has to offer.
