Figs=Fruit=Healthy. None of these things should be found in a cookie. Today, however, I am feeling generous, and I do remember a few years back when I got on this health kick and did buy one package the strawberrry low-fat ones. I actually ate the cookies. That's why I'll, generously, give two stars.
