As his character ages from high school age through adulthood, Tom Cruise is great in this movie. Watching this movie, I couldn't believe the conditions at the VA hospitals and how much the Vietnam vets were hated when they returned. This movie had a great impact on the univerally positive reception that the U.S. troops received upon their return from the Persian Gulf.
