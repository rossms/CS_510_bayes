I've only been to Scotland once (Edinburgh), but I absolutely loved it. It was gorgeous, and I just loved the atmosphere of the city. Everyone there is so nice, and I had an awesome time visiting the city. I love the way Scottish people talk, (ex. Would you like a bit 'o whiskey? or Do you need a wee bucket of ice?) it's so cute!
