By far the most consistantly better quality FFR in my area. (The menu is so simple; how could you screw THAT up? ;) I have always had above average quality product in any Krystal location I have visited in the state of Georgia. Sometimes the service rendered could should have been more efficient, but, compared to other FFR's available, this organization seems to have most (but not quite all, yet) of it's priorites in place.
