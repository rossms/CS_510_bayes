I cannot believe that you people talk this way about Wards. I still strongly believe that, as the slogan said, you couldn't have shopped smarter. Wards provided extraordinary value and affordable quality to those who ordinarily wouldn't have been able to afford it. The Wards Card made it easy for people to purchase things, and I'll be damned before I see another department store that provides the value and service that Wards did. Not to mention their excellent store design. Sears needs to get off of their Windows XP-wannabe store design kick. Sears, Where else? WARDS!
