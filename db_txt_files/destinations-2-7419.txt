Hmmm, personally I don't know what all the fuss is about. I spent two days down there and perhaps that wasn't enough but it was enough for me. Yeh, I like the club scene but don't you find it a bit too youthy? I found it dirty and claustrophobic - the pier is now closed and the only highlight was the pavillion. Sorry fellow Brightonians but I would recommend Bournemouth any day.
