If you really, really love pizza, don't go here. As the old saying goes, There's nothing like a great piece of pizza. And this is NOTHING like a great piece of pizza . I'm surprised they don't have more grease fires....but then, the price is about the same as a quart of motor oil....maybe there's a connection......
