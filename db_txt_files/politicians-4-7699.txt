Unlike Washington and Lincoln, Jefferson was a president that performed below his capabilities. The reason for this was that he was perhaps the most intelligent president ever - in terms of IQ. He did many great things for this nation at a critical time. He was a staunch advocate of states superiority over the federal gov't. Would take him in a second today though.
