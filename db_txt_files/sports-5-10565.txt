Has done something that no other coach has ever done. Take a crapy team to a national power house. You may not like him because you are fans of another school but you can't disreguard what he has done for the program. I garantee you he makes College Football Hall Of Fame and when that happens you can no longer say he sucks. Because you you know it's not true. You may not like him as a person but he is one hell of a coach! And if you still want to say he sucks, well that just goes to show you how little you know about football and how narrow minded you are.
