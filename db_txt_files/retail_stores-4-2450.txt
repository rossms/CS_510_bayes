Great store to shop at. Unbeatable prices and great service. The newer stores are beautiful and well kept, while the older ones could use some reconditioning. They have no problem with long lines and most often have more then enough lanes open. They have a good mix of everyday products and exotic hard to find premiums. Nice place to do your frequent shopping, at least at the newer ones.
