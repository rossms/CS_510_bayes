I'm not really into flavored cigarettes like cloves or methols, but these are really good! They have a nice, somewhat subtle mint flavor...it kind of tastes like you're smoking a stick of Wrigley's spearmint gum. I got started on them after bumming one from a friend, and before I was even done smoking it in we were in the car to the shop down the street so I could buy a few packs. Very classy, dinner party type of smoke...even non-smokers think they're kind of cool. Very high quality smoke to boot.
