Sorry, I don't litmus test my past president's performances based on one issue, be it race relations, personal habits, military service, etc. To do so is the sign of a closed mind. The fact is, while Wilson was a known racist, the things he did to bring about good and prosperity to the United States and the rest of the world are not only very progressive, they're darned right legendary. I'd expect someone who supposedly attended graduate school to realize that.
