these are awesome! great, lingering taste. the smoke is very thick and the smell stays on you for awhile but i love these things. only reason i wouldnt give them a 5 is because i couldnt see myself smoking them consistently. i bum these from my friend all the time, and i enjoy them, but i couldnt see myself finishing off a pack by myself without getting bored
