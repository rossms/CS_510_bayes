Renee seems to be a nice girl and a down to earth person, and she's getting 2 stars because she's from Houston (where I'm living now). However, as an actress, she lives A LOT to be desired. Her characters are so unbelievably underdeveloped and bland, and I really can't tell the difference between her role in Nurse Betty or Me, Myself and Irene . There's no difference at all to me. Unless she shows me that she can seperate her personality from the role in which she plays, she won't be regarded highly in my book.
