When I was young, McDonald's appealed to me. But now that I am old, I am more health conscious, and wouldn't like to eat McDonald's any more. Even though McDonald's is trying to change their image, I still do not feel like McDonald's has a friendly environment. I would only go there to eat if I was in a hurry.
