We have banned Payless shoes in our house. The materials that most of them are made of don't breathe. So...if you want sweaty feet, buy their shoes. If not, go elsewhere. (This is aside from the fact that Starr Jones made some horrible comments about the character of Atheists recently. If I DID shop at Payless prior to her comments, I wouldn't now.)
