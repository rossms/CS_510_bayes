A barren landscape. Posion in the soil, with the garish metropolis of Las Vegas- which does not have the infrastructure to support the hordes of newcomers- which means it is one big botched up mess- this view is held by smart visitors and residents alike. Becoming vastly overpriced- the real estate market is being pumped up by greedy speculators. Not a bad place to live 30 years ago- it is not now.
