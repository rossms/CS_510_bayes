I'm one Mainer who doesn't care for Collins all that much. She continually turns down any increase in the minimum wage (check her record) and is more concerned about small business than diminishing worker's rights and the needy. She does deserve credit for opposing many of Bush's budget proposals to privatize Social Security and along with Maine senator Snowe, she pared down his enormous tax cut years ago that has primarily benefited the wealthy.
