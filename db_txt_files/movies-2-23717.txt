I never cared for this movie. I think it has nice effects but I feel it was way over the top. Brendan Fraser did an okay job but will not knock you out of your socks. I was actually pleasently surprised about Dwayne Johnson's (The Rock) performance. He did pretty good. But I just did not care for this movie at all.
