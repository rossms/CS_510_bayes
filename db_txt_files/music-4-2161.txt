Another good Wilco album, but in my opinion, not as good as the first Mermaid Avenue, or as Being There. I would agree with the user below who says that the Billy Bragg songs aren't quite as good as they are on the first one - and I also despise the Nathalie Merchant I Was Born song so much that it actually taints the album.
