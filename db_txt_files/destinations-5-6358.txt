Nashville is off the meter. It's so tight. They have tons of musicians performing on the streets. There are a lot of up-and-coming bands to watch. Rap is starting to get big here too with Young Buck, Eightball, MJG, and Three Six Mafia. Besides the music scene, the food is off the hook. The people are really friendly and helpful. I really enjoyed visiting Tennessee and would come back here anytime.
