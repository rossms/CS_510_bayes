11 National Championships. 7 Heisman Trophy winners. Effectively tied with Michigan for all-time winning percentage (within 3-4 games over a 100+ year period, changes every couple of years depending on trends) There is no greater team in the history of college football. Period. Not even close. All other ratings to the contrary are simply jealous of Notre Dame's success.
