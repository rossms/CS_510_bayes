Be sure and take the short footpath that takes you to the base of the monument for some really neat views you don't see from the viewing area. There is also a nice restaurant that serves a pretty good breakfast at a decent price and you dine with a view of the monument. Definitely worth going to see. You only have to pay for parking.
