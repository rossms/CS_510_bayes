Nice little town, but should hardly be the top rated city in South America. I spent some time recruiting at universities there, and the one thing I remember is the rain. When it rains in Belo, it rains hard... when I was there the streets were rivers, and the whole city was at a standstill. Belo is a mildly prosperous, fairly industrial town... kind of like Monterey, Mexico. Not worth a trip in itself.
