the sets, lighting and other visual aids were stunning. the makers definitely were trying to give it an old-classic-movie feel to it and for the most part they succeeded. it was a sweet and pleasant movie, overall very well done. although i wasn't quite sure about the ending. it sufficed but something about it seemed too abrupt. i dunno, i was half-expecting for the town to be so occupied with their new-found happiness they wouldn't notice her and her daughter sneaking off to fix the next town, like in mary poppins. other than that i'd definitely recommend it.
