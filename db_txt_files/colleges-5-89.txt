This school has a zero hype and simply the most outstanding students, both in terms of their charisma and in terms of their superior knowledge. I consider Harvard, Columbia and Wharton in the same league. All the other schools lack on some front or the others. Other rankings agree- the least volatile school in terms of ranking. Super job done by the dean!
