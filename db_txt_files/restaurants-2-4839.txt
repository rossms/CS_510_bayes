Getting progressively worse and worse. Is it me or are the portion sizes shrinking over the years... I don't think they're serving the meals on bigger plates I know that. Not only that it takes 3 days to get your meal after you order. There's always waits on weekends and it just isn't worth it whatsoever. Go to Perkins or a diner.
