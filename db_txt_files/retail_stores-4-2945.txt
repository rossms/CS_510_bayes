My boyfriend and I went to our local Kay's jewelers this past weekend to look and get ideas for an engagement ring for myself. The customer Service was wonderful. I told the sales rep what I liked about a ring and she showed me some beautiful pieces. I live in Maryville,Tn and this was located in Foothills mall. I believe that every store has good and bad things about them but I haven't seen that side from this Kay's.
