I remember reading this as a teenager years ago. because we had to. and then another 25 years later. It is a pretty good book about a teenager at a crossroads in his life. After being kicked out of yet another private school, Holden is on his way home with the dread of telling his parents. He is an unhappy teen not knowing what he wants with his life.A book written over 50 years ago can still stand today.I have a teenage daughter who just had to read this for her high school.{she thought it was boring}.Not one of my favorites, but pretty good.
