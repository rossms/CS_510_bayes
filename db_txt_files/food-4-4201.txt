Good and not enterily bad for you either. I like to put a little (not tons) grated cheese on them and bake them in the oven, my cousin calls them grilled cheese because he likes that better than actual grilled cheese sandwiches. I also like them on their own although they are dry. More or less, if you like hearty kinda crackers or cereal, such as all-bran, you'll probably like plain triscuit but if you don't then maybe you should stay away or pour on the toppings.
