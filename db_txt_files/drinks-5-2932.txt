Got those after noon, after lunch heavy eyes? Are you busy working at your PC and you look up to see page after page of the character your finger is sleeping on repeated across the screen? The solution is a can of XS Energy. WOW. Driving late at night I used to drink copious amounts of coffee. The coffee didn't keep me awake but the frequent stops to pee did. Now just one or two cans of XS and I'm good to go for 3 to 6 hours non stop. WOW (backwards that's WOW).
