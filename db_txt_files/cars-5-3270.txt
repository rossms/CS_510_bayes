I think this suv is a great on-road and off-road vehicle! Very comfortable ride just going to the grocery stores and the mall but really kicks ass when off-roading. Crawls on big rocks and bumpy mountainside rain or shine. Awesome performance! Jeep makes real off-road vehicles...you know, the real suvs. The others...well, sad to say, they're really just cars.
