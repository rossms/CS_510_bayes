Obviously since i gave it a four it isnt the greatest album of all tymes. but with songs lyke show me how to live, what u r, like a stone, i am the highway, and shadow on the sun i kant help but enjoy the great songs this album has. overall it is a good album but towards the end i didnt lyke how it all died down-way 2 much.
