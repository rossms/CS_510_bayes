I once though he was good but after seeing how he supported Bush he lost respect with me. Every time you saw him in support for Bush he looked so insincre and it was obvious that he was still angry over loosing the primary. He could Have helped George Bush get elected more clearly. But his half-harted insincere support' for Bush made me very disapointed in him.
