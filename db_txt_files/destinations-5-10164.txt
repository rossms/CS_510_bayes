Best cigarettes in the world. Can't go without one. Best compliment to alcohol. Some say it's too hard, and well, yeah it is, but not as strong as other brands. It stinks, but no one smokes to smell good. Never hesitate to throw money down for a pack o' Reds. Although it is getting steep it is still cheaper than other brands.
