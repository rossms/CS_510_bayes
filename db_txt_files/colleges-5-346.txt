A good variety of units to choose from in the elective stage, from the obvious (finance, HR, marketing) to the more unusual, (technology management, creativity, knowledge management). The courses are well written specifically for distance learning, rather than just being given a pile of set books. The residential schools are marvelous for bringing it all together. Gwyn Moses
