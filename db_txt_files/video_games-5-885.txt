5 stars only for an improved version (otherwise, its can be rather dull): My wife and I will play 2 colors at once (opposite corners). It is surprisingly more intriguing and requires some serious and occasionally kooky and brilliant strategy. Still you don't walk away exhausted--it remains an easy-going game. I could never play the original rules again.
