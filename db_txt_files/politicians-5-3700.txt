George W. Bush will be a great President. He was an extremely effective and popular governor in Texas and was re-elected overwhelmingly with 70% of the vote. George W. Bush is an honest man, a sincere man, and a decent man. He will restore honor and dignity to the White House. He will include men and women of all races in his administration and will break barriers by doing so. The country needs an amiable leader who has demonstrated that he can work in a bipartisan fashion for the good of both parties. George W. Bush is just that man.
