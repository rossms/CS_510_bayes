Britney Spears... not the greatest singer in the world, but I like a lot of her songs. In her debut album, ...Baby One More Time, britney has such hits as (You Drive Me) Crazy, Sometimes, and Born To Make You Happy, that made her famous. There is of course the title track, as well, that was excellent when it first came out, but is kind of tiresome now. If she just had a better voice, this CD would be so much better. Plus, while there are a few good songs, the rest are not too great.
