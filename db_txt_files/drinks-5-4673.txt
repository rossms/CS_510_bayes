Coca-Cola is the ultimate soft-drink. It has a very refreshing taste that gets me through hard long days. Coca-Cola is best very cold(ice cold if you will) in a beer mug with 2 ice cubs. It even gets rid of my headaches if I get one. This is an amazing drink and I don't think that I would have made it this far without it. (Better than Pepsi!)
