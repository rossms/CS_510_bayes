Haven't been to the very north of Finland- but have been to Helsinki and Turkku and will say this- it is a fantastic place- I'd love to live half the year in Finland and the other half at home (Australia) The most beautiful women in the world (I'm not kidding)- great beer fantastic food.. One thing- Finns don't smile much unless they're pissed- they don't say much either (in Finnish or in English) But it's a great country-
