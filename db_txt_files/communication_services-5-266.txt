Awesome Customer Service, and very friendly reps. Only have trouble with waiting during the Christmas holidays. Wonderful coverage plans for southern MN and northern IA. Great for non-roamers like me. The company is always trying to improve for the customers, not just for their pocketbooks like some cellular companies.
