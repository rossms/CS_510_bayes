This book was pretty good. I heard it twice in middle school. The author of the book warns you that the book does not have a happy beginning OR ending. It is about three children, Sonny, Klaus, and violet who's parents and their house died in a terrible. they were sent to live with a relative, who is accualty trying to get the Kids' family's fortune. all of the books in the series deal with the children and the bad luck. I have only read this and book 2 [Reptile Room] if you do not like stories with bad luck, this is not for you.
