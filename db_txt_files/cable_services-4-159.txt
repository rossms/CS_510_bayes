Excellent selection of channels including various history and science channels, movie channels such as the hbo channels, pay per view, and all those mtv and vh1 channels. however, the only problem is that some extra channels such as science channel only stays on out tv after we get our direct tv card reset than they go off and you have to reset the channel again.
