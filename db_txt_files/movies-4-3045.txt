The hispanic drug lord deserves some credit because the very real-sounding accent he had in the movie was, it has been alleged, put on. However, and by no fault of his own, he was in the movie more than his character really deserved to be. I gave Shaft a 4-Good because Jackson pretty much is Shaft. The ending wasn't the shocker that I think it was meant to be, though. In fact, I think a cross-examination/courtroom scene would have been a better ending to this street-wise storyline. We should cinematize capital punishment while it's still legal. I recommend Shaft to anyone who likes Samuel L. Jackson movies.
