Im amazed at the comeback...theres a big chance of winning the division but superbowl is a long ways off. Just don't be fooled and think that last year was luck. The panthers are good and they have been plagued with injury this year...the top rushers...kasay for a couple of games....Went to the bucs panthers game....it was awesome...going to the game this weekend too...Im all for the panthers ruling the world!! Don't count them out... Go Panthers!
