I just don't understand why, in this great country of ours, that there are actually people who don't like Funyuns. I am dumbfounded, and a bit disgusted...... Funyuns are without a doubt the greatest snack of our time, perhaps even of all time. If I were to be stranded on an island, I would hope that I would have an endless supply of sunscreen, drinking water, and Funyuns. If I were to go to battle in the War of All Snacks, I would choose only one weapons....a bag of Funyuns. And I would victorious, my friends.
