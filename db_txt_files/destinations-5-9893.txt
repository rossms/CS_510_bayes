Great smooth cigarette, Dunhills are different from any other cigarette I've ever smoked. When you take one out of the box and smell it, it smells really nice. You can tell that they use high quality tobacco. Dunhill is a name that's well respected in the tobacco world as well as cologne and mens accesories(?!) The smoke is smooth and sweet and It's my cigarette of choice. And to whoever said they "pad" their cigarettes with balsa wood is wrong, no cigarette company does that. Dunhill is one of the most respected names in the tobacco world.
