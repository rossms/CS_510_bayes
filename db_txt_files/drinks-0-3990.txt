I just came back from Puerto Rico after having been there for a month, and I got addicted to Don Q Limon. Does anyone know where I can buy that from online, I'm pretty sure that they don't sell it in stores anywhere. I will never go back to bacardi after tasting the Don Q Limon. Cruzan may be able to hold me over until I can go back to PR for more, but until then does anyone have any clues?
