A friend and I just got back from ten days in Oaxaca and Puerto Escondido and I can't rave enough about it. Sitting each day in the main square of this friendly city and people watching would have been enough, but we added side trips to spectacular pre-Columbian ruins, food markets and wonderful museums and churches. The churches especially took me totally by surprise with their wealth, art and general grandeur. Many of them were built in the sixteenth century! There was a special art exhibit in the modern museum of Oaxaca and I feel like I discovered a new artist in Francisco Gutierrez.
