I am a big fan of historical movies and this was a great documentary on what life during war is like. The brutality, despair, and hopelessness was wonderfully portrayed in the film. The storyline was good for demonstrating the coverage and bravery of soliders, and also for showing the audience the loss families endured during war times.
