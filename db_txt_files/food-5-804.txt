What's not to like about Total? Downing one bowl is better than taking a multi-purpose vitamin, and, with the right amount of sugar, it actually tastes pretty good. As someone who almost always eats food that isn't healthy, it's reassuring that a bowl of Total, even with a lot of sugar, is doing more good than harm. Lately I've been mixing Total with Life, and the result is damn fine if I do say so my own self.
