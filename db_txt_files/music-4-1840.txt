A real mix of music and idea's here. It's essentialy a combination of Adore and Siamese dream, With Billy and Co using the much loved heavy guitar chords and riffs with the electronic and machine (no pun intended) keyboards and synth work. I really enjoyed the album but feel that you have to listen to it quite a few time to really ge into it. Tracks to look out for are Heavy Metal Machine, A Power chord laden old stly rock song and Age of Innocence, which kind of sounds like Tonight, Tonight, with haunting melodies and great work by James Iha.
