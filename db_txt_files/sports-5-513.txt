Mike Piazza is the best thing that has happened to major league baseball. Football has always been my sport until I spotted Piazza. He is so sexy. Sorry guys but we women have a right to watch your sports even if it's just to look at the hot guys. Turnabout is fair play. Oh--he's a great player too....
