Only on tap--Don't bother with the imported bottles or cans. It has to be poured correctly, no short cuts please. We were able to get Extra Cold in Scotland. It takes an acquired taste, but it's worth it. Don't try to compare it with a Pilsner, That's like comparing apples to oranges.I once saw a poll: What is the best tasting beer? The correct answer is; the one YOU like best.
