I don't know why the hell all of these people are givin J-dub 5! Ya mabey every once in a while he can do somethin that looks hot, but his numbers how that he has no all round game. He may get fans to come and watch the game, but his defence is s***t, He can't shoot nothin, and he gets more turnovers a game then the rest of the Kings combined. All of these people saying he's got the best handel in leauge is a pile of s***t, what about J Kidd, GP, or even Starbury. J-dub is the most overrated player in the NBA ever! So J-dub, stop smokin weed and start playin ball for real!
