I am 50% of the way through my Marketing MBA at Capella. I find the instructors to be fair. You are pushed to excel and you get out what you put into it. A very good program. Capella is NOT a degree mill - see the US and News World report which states is both accredited and reputable. I find online instruction convenient although it may not be for eveyone.
