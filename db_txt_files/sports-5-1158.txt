Omar Vizquel is one of the best shortstops ever. The combination of him at short and Robbie Alomar at second makes the Indians a very good defensive team. Every year, Omar adds to his highlight film with some of the best fielding catches, impossible throws, and acrobatic plays in baseball. I hope to some day see Omar make it to the hall of fame. He is also one of the hardest charity workers in the game. He is always a gentleman in public, and is very nice to his fans. He is a bargin at the price Cleveland is paying him.
