Yummy. I actually like McDonald's better than Burger King. I love the breakfast. I like it so much, that whenever my mom goes out to buy me some of it, I pick a different meal number without even knowing what it brings. I think it's one of the best fast food places made yet! I think the breakfast is what makes it the best.
