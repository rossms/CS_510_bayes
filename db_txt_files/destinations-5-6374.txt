Tennessee's a fine state. Beautiful mountains, rolling hills, wonderful lakes and countryside. It has it's share of rednecks and uneducated hicks, but anyone with an ounce of intelligene will figure out that these characteristics can be found anywhere. If this were not true, then please explain the ghettos and inner city problems that run rampant in NY,LA, and Chicago?
