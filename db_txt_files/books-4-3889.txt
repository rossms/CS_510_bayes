This book is an awesome book for high school kids to read and discuss. It's got adventure, scandles, and contraversy topics. The 'nigger' word is said a lot, but the pompous asses who run this state need to get over it. In the times it was written (and even now) African Americans sometimes refer to themselves this way.
