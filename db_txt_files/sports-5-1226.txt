A class act. Even though he is a superstar, Sammy is still humble. When he and Mark McGwire were racing for the home run record in 1998, he could have said that he was a lot better than Mark, but was one of his biggest supporters, saying that Mark is the man. He has also given lots of money to his hometown in the Dominican Republic, and has taken the time to teach kids in his country how to play baseball during the offseason. In an age when players are consumed by greed, there should be more players like Sammy.
