I own a 2003 Ford Escape (bought it new). Since 5,000 miles I have been having problems with a NASTY smell coming from the vents. It was brought to Ford service 6 times before they replaced the whole system (was replaced in time for winter). Over the winter didn't use air/vents. Come this summer the nasty smell is back. Brought in to Ford and NOW they say that the smell is from my dog and isn't covered under warrenty. I'm sorry but that smell is NOT from my dog. It smells like something crawled in my vents and died. Anyone want to buy a used ford?!?!?? (only 12,000 miles on it)
