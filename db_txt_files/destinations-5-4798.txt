I fell in love with this charming city! I've had the chance to visit most capitals in South America and in my opinion Quito is definitely the most beautiful. The buildings and stunning churches, monasteries, and convents in the Old City are impresive. Forget Old San Juan, Old Quito surpasses it in history, beauty, and size! It's spring-like climate, the landscapes, panorama, and glorious morning skies were spectacular.
