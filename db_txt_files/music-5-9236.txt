This is my favorite song right now and probably one of my favorite videos (along with...WONDERBOY!)Roman Coppola did a fabulous job of having an ameteur, live, variety show type feeling to accompany The Strokes' laid back unflashy air. Did I mention that I LOVE this song? Well If not, I love this song and I'm glad that MTV2 has enough sense to play it as often as they do. If you haven't heard this song(which I LOVE) yet, or seen the video (which I love also.) Then I suggest you do so. Immediately.
