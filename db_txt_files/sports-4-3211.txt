While I wasn't old enough to listen to the Cardinals during his era my friend's father grew up in St. Louis. We were in the stands during Tony Gwynn's presentation of his last silver slugger award presented by Stan Musial. Upon hearing Musial was presenting this fifty something man teared up and commented on how much Musial meant to him growing up in St. Louis. That is what baseball is all about, youth and remembrance.
