Let me start by saying Vermont is one of the greatest states in the union, I'm so pleased my parents now live there. UVM however, has gone downhill a little since I attended in the early 90's. The education one can receive and the surroundings more then pass mustard. However the place seems to have become overrun with hippie wannabes who talk a good game as they drive in their huge Range Rovers which they got from mommy and daddy. This can be quite annoying especially to the in-staters.
