I love Tony. He has successfully brought Labour into the 21st Century and made it a PARTY that people can vote for. He is trying his best to get Labour ideals into the middle of the road, conservative by nature English and I applaud him for it. DON'T VOTE KEN. He is evil. Vote for anyone else but NOT ken.
