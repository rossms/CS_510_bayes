This is absolutely the best comic book movie I have ever seen. The storyline is pretty accurate. The action scenes were outstanding. Reminded me a little bit about the Matrix. It also let the world now about discrimination and some of the issues about it. So, it may have enlightened some people, or opened their eyes about it.
