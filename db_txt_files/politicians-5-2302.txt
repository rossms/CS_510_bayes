I for one do not know too much about Colin Powell but from what I know, I can trust him. I mean, Look at what he did during the Gulf War! He was a four star general before he retired, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and is the Recipient of numerous US.and even Foreign awards. This proves to me that he is a pretty trustworthy guy!
