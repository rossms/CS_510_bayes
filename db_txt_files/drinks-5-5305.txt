Sprite is a delicious, clear, fizzy soft drink that is perfect when you don't feel like cola. I find it thirst-quenching and the touch of lemon-lime gives it some flavor. Coke is my favorite cola, and Sprite, also a Coca-Cola product, is my favorite non-cola soda. -Guess the original company is still the best!
