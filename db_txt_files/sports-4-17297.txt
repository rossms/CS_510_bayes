Note to Fox14: Not all Eagles fans are horrible. But many of them ARE classless meatheads. I think deeming them rednecks is inaccurate. Call them classless meatheads with South Philly accents. Please don't group all Eagles fans into one category. That's not fair. There are really nice ones too. In life, you'll find rotten people. But for every rotten person, there's 10 kind ones.
