I dont' like this group too much but this video was very original and very outstanding and very talented to watch. How on earth could 3 people who were in the Psycho hosipitol be able to play their guitar, bass and drums. It is just pure genious if you ask me. I think it deserves to be one of the Top 100 best videos of all-time!
