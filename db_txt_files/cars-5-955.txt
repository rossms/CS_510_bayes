Honda Accord is definitely on top of the sedan list. The car has it all. It's really affordable, saves on gas, the engine runs like it never ends and it's sportier than ever. The new accord coupe outputs 240 horses, wow! Accord looks way more sporty than the Camry. But the most impressive thing about this car for ages has been the engine. You can never have big problems with this car, cuz the engine has no limits, i mean you could drive this car for your whole life and it wont break down. I must say that to buy an Accord is money well invested!
