This book is very near perfect. It does have some weak points (the action sequence when Ellie first discovers the Message) but is was expertly written by a man at the top of his craft. Sagan was dubious about the idea of God, and his agnosticism shows in this book, but he does treat religion with respect. However, he does mock the Pat Robertson-televangelist type, a fact which may offend some. Overall an extremely worthwhile read.
