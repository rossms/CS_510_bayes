I work part-time at Arby's in Fort Payne, AL and I have to say it is GREAT... Everything is kept very clean, we don't serve anything that we wouldn't be willing to eat ourselves. The fries are always HOT and everything is always fresh. I love working there. I have great fellow employees and a nice work enviorment. The people always come first in our store. And just for the record the roast beefs are not in liquid form or pieces of meat just thrown together it IS an actual roast.
