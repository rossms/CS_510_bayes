Not as good as the book, but I thought it was done well. So well in fact, that to this day I will sometimes get a little freaked out and tingly in my feet (I have that image of Gage under the bed slashing the old man's achilles' heal)..one of those freaky things you can't get out of your head..and then that innocent looking little demon saying I wanna play with YOU daddy yikes, something very freaky about that kid turned devil. King wrote a chilling book that adapted well to the big screen.
