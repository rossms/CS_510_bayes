TJ's rocks ! Definately a cut above the usual grocery chain. Great selection of cereal, juice, organic food, and really great frozen food section full of all kinds of treats. Also good for simmering sauces, try simmering chicken in TJ's mojito sauce (Cuban style citrus sauce).. Yum !! Great prices too, can't go wrong here.
