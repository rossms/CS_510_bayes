By far the greatest ballplayer of all time, no questions asked!!! People today don't realize the impact he had on the game. The way the game is played changes over time so the best way to compare players from different eras is to compare their surroundings. This sums it up--check the record books: In his 2 best home run seasons, he hit more homers than the total number of homers hit by any one team! Love ya Barry Bonds, but before I can compare you to Ruth, you need to out slug all the other teams in the league which is in the area of 150 to 200 homers.
