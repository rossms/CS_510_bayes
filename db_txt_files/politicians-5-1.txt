Diana was beautiful, gracious, compassionate, and overall, an amazing woman. What Prince Charles (and ultimately, the system) did to her was appalling. One can only imagine her torment and heartbreak at his infidelity and having him rubbing her nose in Camilla. In spite of all that, she stayed married to Charles for fifteen years, produced two beautiful boys, and left a mark that forever changed the Royal Family.
