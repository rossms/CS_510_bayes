Wow, there are just so many wonderful things to say about Colorado. Not only is the capital city, DENVER, the most beautiful city in the nation, but this state is so beautiful and pristine. I love the people, as they are almost always so friendly. There are great job opportunities here as well, and the schools are great. I recommend this place for living and vacationing.
