Great restaurants, shopping, atmosphere and so many wonderful old, well maintained mansions! I love this place! And for those of you who fondly remember Dark Shadows - this is also the home of the real Collinwood (Carrie Mansion and now part of Salve Regina University). Be sure to stop by the visitor center for a map and other information if you've never been there before. Can not wait to go back and see more!
