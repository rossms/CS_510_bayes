I really have to say, I have not had any problems with Netflix, as those reported by others on the site. I live in PA, and since they opened a new center in Southwestern, PA, I have been recieving my movies quicker. I am really happy with the service I have gotten so far! I really like the no late fees thing, so I can take the time I need to watch my movies.
