One word describes Jermaine O'Neal: Domination. Truly an NBA monster to be reckoned with, either this season or down the line. Unlike some other 7-footers, Jermaine dominates the court and has talent. I was impressed, reading an ESPN article about him of his days in Portland, about how he cancelled a vacation in Jamaica to practice in South Carolina upon hearing of a trade to Indiana. He's a hard worker, and it's paying off. Look out for him in the future.
