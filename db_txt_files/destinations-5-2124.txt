Beautiful country, AMAZING cuisine (I'm a sucker for good food), friendly people..I had some wonderful experiences there that I may never get to experience again, like riding a camel in Africa and seeing a real snakecharmer, and seeing belly dancers during my meal..the people there are very open, but I agree that it could be difficult from some western women, with clothing and all....I would never pass up another visit, though!
