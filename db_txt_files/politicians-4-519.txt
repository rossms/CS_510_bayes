Nelson M. a commie or a terrorist? Don't think so! Maybe the people who are spreading these incorrect, misinterpreted conceptions are referring to his wife? Please do not forget that it is indeed a very big step from apartheid to democracy. You will notice that this transition has been performed quite smoothly in such a short time! I consider Mandela to be of equal composure as Ghandi. He got peace where most people would have chosen revenge. Truly an inspiration to the nation, if not to the world.
