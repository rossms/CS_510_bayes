This is a DAMN funny movie! DeNiro and Stiller displayed such comedic talent. I thought Robert DeNiro was funny in Analyze This, but his blunt and dry sense of humor in Meet the Parents was hilarious. I have to admit that I got my hopes up a little too high after enjoying Ben Stiller so much in There's Something About Mary, but overall, I really enjoyed this film. I hope to see DeNiro in more comedies, he does such a good job.
