As mentioned below Illinois is the all American State. Chicago rocks! It's skyline is magnificent and Lake Michigan is a very stimulating body of water and makes a great setting for the city. Outside of Chicago lies the quintesential midwest and a lot of farmland. It's not a spectacular landscape but it is very pretty in it's own way and very peaceful. Illinois has a whole lot of friendly people as well which you don't encounter as much on the coasts.
