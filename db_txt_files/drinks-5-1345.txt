I know my wife loves me, because she got me a beer of the month membership. Abita Brewery's TurboDog was one of the first beer's delivered, and it was great. It has a great chocolate taste and goes down easy. It is a dark beer that I could drink regularly if it were in stores. I reccomend this beer to anybody who can get their hands on it.
