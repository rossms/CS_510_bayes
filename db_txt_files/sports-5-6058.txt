Pittsnogle is a tough matchup, because he plays like a shooting guard at just under 7 feet. If you put a shorter player on him, he just shoots over top of them, and if you put a big guy on him, he is just too athletic from out around the perimeter. He is a big reason why WV is currently undefeated in the best conference in the country. UConn/WV will be a big game.
