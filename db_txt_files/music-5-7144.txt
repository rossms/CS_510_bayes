the song is great and so is the video, but anyone who doesnt think the song was overplayed is kidding themselves. Kurt Cobain despised the mainstream, and Smells Like Teen Spirit basically made Nirvana mainstream. It was a cause of his suicide(he didnt want to be mainstream). the mainstream crowd ate it up and pretty soon the perfect little girl became the misunderstood depressed conformist teen.video was great, mainstream killed it.
