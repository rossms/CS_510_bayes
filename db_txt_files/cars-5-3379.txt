I bought my '98 Wrangler new and it has never given me a problem- never broke down once! I've had plenty tire changes, but that's because I drive it as it was meant to be driven! All I've needed besides new tires is regular oil changes and a new steering damper (75 bucks). She's never let me down- I'll keep her til she dies, then get another one. If you cant handle a few bumps and some noise, you shouldn't be looking at Jeeps in the 1st place!
