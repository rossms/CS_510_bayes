What can I say about his Airness ? Simply the most well-rounded player, and the best player overall. I view him as a man of no fear and a man of dedication that has achieved great skill. A player who is the perfect 10 (why did this rating only go up to 5?). He had the speed, the jumping ability, the shot, the dribbling skills and a clutch player that comes through when you need him most. Heh, I remember being told Never fade away when shooting... unless you have a 23 on your jersey ..
