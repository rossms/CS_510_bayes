Another pointless rant? Who's gonna take him out of office? What it takes to have a president removed is mind boggling. If anybody finds their faith in short supply, suck it up and wait for the next election or leave the country. Five million votes are a bit hard to fix and this removal talk holds little basis in reality. UPDATE: I'll believe that the war is for oil when I stop paying three bucks a gallon for gas.
