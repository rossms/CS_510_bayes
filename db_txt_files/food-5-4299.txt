I'm a big fan of Smart Food. Every now and then it's a great change of pace from chips. There's enough cheddar flavor on it to be good without being overwhelming. My only complaint is that there are usually quite a few unpopped kernels in each bag, so if you're not careful you can really nail your teeth on one.
