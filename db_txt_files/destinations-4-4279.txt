I have lived in the Richmond area for about 20 yrs now and I wish everyone who has just traveled through or has only lived here a few years would stop complaining. If you actually take awhile to look into things, Richmond is actually a decent place to live. And no, not everyone is snobby or redneck. Actually..Richmond is a far cry from both redneck and snobby. Not everything smells like tabacco and there is a night life in some parts or the city, you just have to know where they are. Richmond may not be for everyone, but I can tell you, it def. deserves a look at.
