Barry Bonds job is to play baseball and he is one of the best in the history of the game. If the Giants want help in the PR department, they can hire someone else. If Bonds were to try to change the way he behaved, what effect would it have on his game? Maybe nothing, who knows? And are Tom Cruise, Meg Ryan, Maddonna, etc. considered jerks if they don't sign everything put in front of them?
