I've decided update my comment on Ben Stiller and give him 4 stars instead of 3. He truly seems to be a good actor. His more serious role in Keeping the Faith showed that he could be a major player in other genres besides comedy in the future. His performances in Meet the Parents and There's Something About Mary were wonderful, not to mention his performance in Zero Effect with Bill Pullman. Ben Stiller, if he branches out into other genres, could be a major player in Hollywood. I think he'd do well in some drama roles.
