As a Jefferson enthusiast, I'd like to share a few quotes that you all might find interesting. Here's what Thomas Jefferson thought of his alma mater, William & Mary: We have in that state a college just well enough endowed to draw out the miserable existence to which a miserable constitution has doomed it. Also, how about this gem? To stop where we are is to abandon our high hopes, and become suitors to Yale and Harvard for their secondary characters. Hence, why he founded UVA. Great school, by the way! Oh yeah, go Princeton!
