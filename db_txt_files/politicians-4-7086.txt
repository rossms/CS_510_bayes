I would like to say to the Rev. Jackson, I am sorry the situation which you have put yourself in but remember that no man is a perfect being. For we all has come short of his glory. I admire you very much for telling your wife and family about the situation before hand.It's not up to me judge you only God can judge.The bible says; HE WITHOUT SIN LET HIM CAST THE FIRST STONE. The bible also says: I WILL LIFT UP MY EYES UNTO THE HILLS FROM WHENCE COMETH HELP; MY HELP COMETH FROM THE lORD.So hold your head up high and keep the FAITH my dear brother. GOD BLESS
