Several posters have pointed out that Smith took teams to the Final Four 11 times but won only two championships. Bear in mind, though, that 3 of those Final Four trips were in the late 60's when UCLA totally dominated with virtually unbeatable teams. If you look at the post-UCLA period, Smith's teams won 2 championships out of 8 FInal Fours, which is pretty good.
