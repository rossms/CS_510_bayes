I was a Kodiak user until the price went to High. started with Wintergreen in 1980 and swithed to Ice when it came out 10 years ago, Now that the price has gone to outragous I switched to cheaper brands Grizzly mint is so close to Kodiak Ice I swear it is the same, after all they are made by the same company.
