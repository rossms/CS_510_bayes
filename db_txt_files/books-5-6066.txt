I think that The Bear and the Dragon is a superb book, exceeding my expectations. Tom Clancy is truly a gifted author and has earned my respect as an exceedingly intelligent man. His indepth knowledge of the government and military are amazing considering he has never served in either. This book is up there with Sum of All Fears and Red Storm Rising.
