I've been a big Pedro fan for years. He's great, argueably the best in baseball. I've been upset with him lately however because he's been crying about the Boston organization. They're paying him millions to pitch. What they say to the media or what the media says to the public is out of his control. If he's not happy he can leave during free agency; no need to bring the team down.
