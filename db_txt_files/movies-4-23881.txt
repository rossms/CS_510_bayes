A child is born and is tested fior diseases that he may be vulnerable to. His blood goes into a national database that keeps him from getting the job he wants. A great and realistic movie about discrimination. Only it's on a genetic level. Uma Thurman, Jude Law, and Ethan Hawke are great in this movie. Danny DeVito helped produce this movie.
