Profound insights regarding any kind of conflict in this famous book (by the way, one of the most successful imports from a rather alien culture to the West, ancient China). As irishgit points out, get a good translation: it is easy to make Sun Tzu into a kind of bubble gum that can be stretched into any shape you want. Pay special attention to the chapter on spies.
