In my opinion, a truly underrated state. I had to drive through it once going to Cali and it was one of the highlights of my trip. The scenery is breathtaking and you get a true sense of culture here (unlike SD where everything has been spoiled by tourism). Didn't get a chance to do more than getting gas, but did get the impression that it would be a good place for outdoor rec.
