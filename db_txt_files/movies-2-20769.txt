This supposed cult classic is by far one of the least entertaining movies I've ever seen. To see Tim Curry run around as a drag queen, make a terribly directed and written parody of a classic novel that was beautifully written. It's stupid, the characters are disgusting and the songs make no sense. There are many better parodies made. This is the worst of all.
