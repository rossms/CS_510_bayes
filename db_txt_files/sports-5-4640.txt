I'm not sure how much I like Pitino and it sure was nice to see him get humbled with the Celtics, but there is no denying that he is one of the best college basketball coaches in the NCAA history. He will resurrect the Louisville program which probably would have been successful next year anyway (young team and good recruiting class). I think it's also kind of funny to see how Kentucky fans are crying that he is a traitor.
