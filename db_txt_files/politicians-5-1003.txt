Vincente Fox is to Mexico what Benigno Aquino was to the Philippines, Nelson Mandela was to South Africa, and David Ben-Gurion was to Israel -- the popular standard bearer of people who finally wriggled out from under an oppressive thumb. Mexico always had the ability to be a first-tier nation, and under Se ior Fox, they just might do it. Buenas suerte!
