I can't stand the Titans, as I'm a hard core Jaguar fan. But I will give them props; I was estatic when they started off horribly. Then Steve McNair and the boys started a run. Carlos Hall played brilliantly as Jevon Kearse's backup before he was hurt too. He has a lot of upswing, and may be a big name End in a few years. Hopefully my boys can take down the Titans next year.
