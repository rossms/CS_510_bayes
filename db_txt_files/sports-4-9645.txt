An above-average team. Miami has been struggling this year because Hardaway's been out. Even with Hardaway, however, they don't really have what it takes to beat the New Yorks, the Portlands, or the Lakers. They lost to New York last year in the playoffs, and didn't make any changes. This year, they have an older and oft-injured Hardaway..Best thing is to retool around Mourning, who, is the best defensive center in the league - and probably has more heart and soul than anyone in the league!
