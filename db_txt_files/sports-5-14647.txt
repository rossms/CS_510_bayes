One of if not the best defensive players of all time. Nobody hit like Ronnie Lott.Update: Sabasimba, you say Ronnie Lott did not dominate, then if he didn't who did? That was what Ronnie did, if he hit you, you went down and you stayed down. This man lost a finger because he wanted to stay in a game.
