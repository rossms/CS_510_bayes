Ontario is fabulous! The attractions, the way the residents act toward tourists, the scenery...it all falls into place perfectly, like the pieces of a jigsaw puzzle. Toronto is a great city with a pretty cool baseball team, and you are made to feel welcome no matter where you are. Unless, of course, you are one of those nuts who thinks Canada is nothing more than a US colony :-( Oh, and by the way, find some chance to eat at Medieval Times! It's this great restaurant with staged knight fights...sort of like prowrestling only it's even better. Overall, Ontario is fabulous. Take care, everyone!
