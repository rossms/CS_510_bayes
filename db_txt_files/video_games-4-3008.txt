I loved playing this game on different levels, it made it next to impossible to beat on the higher ones (which is missing in the bulk of watered down games). The gameplay was great, the storyline had some minor flaws but nothing major. My only beef is that the dogtag collecting takes eight years (which is good), but the rewards seem kind of crappy and pointless for all that hard work (not so good). Other than that, great game.
