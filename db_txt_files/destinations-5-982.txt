I suppose we are to rate this country as a tourist destination, (not as a place of permanent living), And I would say if I had to see just one country in the world, I would see Britain. All right, slightly overpriced but so is the rest of the Europe. Rewards, best of the historical buildings, most fashionable streets, excellent public transport system with extremely good network, best of the museums, most beautiful country side, cities like London and Oxford and idyllic places like the Isle of wight and Lake district. Frankly I have enjoyed it each time I have been there.
