Lucerne is one of the nicest cities I've been to in Europe. Very clean, historic, the archetecture is beautiful. Its location on a mountain lake makes it even more beautiful and unique, definitely a different type of European city. Go to Mount Pilatus while you're there; the views are beautiful. The feel of the city is different than Zurich, that is much more urban, Lucerne has the feeling of a mountain town. During the summer, the city tends to get full of tourists, but it nonetheless retains its charms.
