"Take me back to Kathmandu" ... a place like no other and one that relies on tourism for alot of it's income so go if you can. As long as there are no travel advisories, get there if you like wonderful people, good food, awesome temples and architecture and of course, a few hours bus ride to the majestic Himalayas. Accommodation is abundant and cheap and this is the place to start a trek you'll never forget. I did the Langtang trek in 2000 and will take my wife to do Annapurna in the next couple years. And get a window seat as you fly into or out of Kathmandu, the pilot will point out Everest.
