I hate Stallone. I am not a big Kurt Russell fan either. This movie was still good. It was fun. Two cops who bust all the drug dealers get set up as dealers and arrested and have to escape prison to clear thier names. The scene where Russell has to dress as a dyke and ride off with Teri Hatcher on a Motor bike was too funny.
