North America's best city. The power here is amazing. We are all affected by New York if we love the place or hate it. People complain that New Yorkers are unfriendly. I have never found this to be the case. Get to know them and believe me folks, these are some of the nicest people you will ever meet. There are so many inventions and such a rich history here. Gotta love New York.
