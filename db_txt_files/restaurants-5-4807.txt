Red Lobster has improved to a great extreme over the past few years. Their food has become a lot tastier and healthier for you. I love their rolls here, they are so fresh and full of flavor. Their fish here is great, I love their haddock fish. Their coleslaw is great, with fresh cabbages. The fries are fine, what could be bad about a fry?
