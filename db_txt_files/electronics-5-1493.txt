Easy to live with sound - not harsh or brash - full range - no need for a subwoofer, although one is available from the same manufacturer - Excellent speakers for most stereo systems, the Vandersteens are made even better with the addition of a BBE ARSF3 (Audio Restoration System) available from SoundCity.com, which makes these speakers SING.
