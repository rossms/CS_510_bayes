Two words: blindfolded jetpack knife fights. OK, four words. As you can tell this beer is high level. Ive been drinking since 7 A.M. Ill be fine after I vomit. In all seriousness though, this is a great beer.Try the SA CherryWheat,mmmmm good stuff!! So put down the Heineken, or I will have no choice but to take matters into my own hands.
