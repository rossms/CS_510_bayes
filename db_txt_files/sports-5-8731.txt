A superior shooter who, despite being a bit soft on defense, is destined to make the NBA hall-of-fame. Usually averages a double-double for the season and, had it not been for Mark Cuban's ridiculously stupid idea to let Steve Nash escape (and then tell the world that he had improved his team's defense!!??) he would probably be plying his talents in the league finals for years to come. Some people just have no idea. It seems that Dirk is suffering from some racsist thinking by some of the reviewers in this poll. Either that, or they just know what they're talking about.
