Fathi gepril elgawo, who you can meet on the R.E.M page, are the perfect example of your typical friendly, hilarious Libyan. Sure, they were the old terrorist country, but who the freak could dislike ol' Fathi and Adel? Only real reason I took off is because I'm not sure how the Libyans stand the weather. It's in the middle of the freakin' Sahara, for God's sake! But the civilians are friendly, the scenery, though it's in the middle of the desert, is nice, and the camels here don't spit. Take care, everyone!
