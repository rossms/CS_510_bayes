Wow reading some of the reviews of this stuff you'd swear you could live off of it. Truth be known, it has the consistency (and in some people's cases the color) of phlegm and tastes like a sick and twisted coffee beer. Yeah, it's good, but damn it can make you hurl and dry heave until the cops pick your prone carcass up outta the ditch. Of course, I only HEARD that....
