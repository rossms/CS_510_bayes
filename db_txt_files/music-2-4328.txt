I would never deny the fact that Elton John is talented, but I just the find this musician to be way too whiny in his music and his onstage persona. He was and never will be one of my favorites. And to top it off, he is extremely overrated. As for this particular CD, it definately is jam packed full of hits, but they all pretty much sound the same to me, and after while, repetitive music gets boring...no thanks...
