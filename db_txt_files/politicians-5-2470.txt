I think Rudy is the best mayer that New York ever had. The city after David Dinkins became so bad that tourism dropped dramatically. Tourists were shot on the street, shoot outs on the subways. It was Dodge city!! I love the city of NY and Rudy was the best thing that ever happened to the city. Yeah!!!! Let's make Al Sharpton the mayor and maybe we can have Tawana Brawley assistant mayor -- the city would really go down the tubes!
