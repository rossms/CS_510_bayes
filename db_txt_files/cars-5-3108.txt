I wouldn't call this a sports car. For my first car, Im looking at a Sebring Convertible V6 or a Taurus SHO. I dislike the new styling on the Sebring, but the 95-99 model is beautiful. I do not know if I would buy a V4 or not, depending on how fast it accelerated. Actually, I wish this car had V8 options, like the SHO.
