Jen's early career was spellbinding, being as young as I was, as she moved in and out from one sultry part to the next (my eyes are still bouncing from CAREER OPPORTUNITIES and SOME GIRLS). She's since inched into A-list circles and, while I'm happy for her, I'll always pine for the scantily-dressed days.
