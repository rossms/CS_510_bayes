I wish I could tell you I like Heineken. It seems to be a great beer to like. Interesting tradition, brewed in Holland, has a slightly more sophisticated image than most other popular beers... But man I hate drinking this swill. I don't claim to have the most developed palate, so take this for what it's worth, but Heineken always tastes skunked to me. I have about four Heinekens in my fridge right now (a friend brought them over and didn't finish them), and I'm afraid they're just going to sit there until I can pawn them off on that same friend the next time he's over.
