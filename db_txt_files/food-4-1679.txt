They are definitely good..I love both chocolate and caramel..but the price you pay after popping a few of these in your mouth, isn't quite worth it. That feeling of trying to free your top molars from the bottom can be excruciating. Instead of extracting Wisdom Teeth, Dentists should consider feeding patients a box of Milk Duds, telling them to bite down on the caramel/chocolate epoxy for 2 minutes and then, when they open their mouth, the tooth will be extracted..
