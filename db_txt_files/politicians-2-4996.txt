Gore has gone absolutely nuts. Screaming at the top of your lungs and calling the President of the United States a traitor is a tad bit much for a former Vice President. It's quite amusing that back in 2000 people accused him of being too boring and now he's too fired up. Gore evidently does not know the meaning of the word statesmanship and is an embarrassment to the Democratic Party. He is nothing more than a political hack who is making an obviously desperate attempt to garner some attention.
