Well, I am sure I will get about 457 not helpful remarks, but this soundtrack is really NOT as good as all the hype it gets. The songs to me are really quite irritating. In fact, the movie itself is quite irritating. But, this is just my opinion (god forbid on an opinion site) so go ahead and say that it's not helpful when really it's just that you like it.
