I would love to rate Chipper as great but I think that it rests more on his shoulders then Bobby Cox that they keep lossing in the Playoffs. His production has not been as good since joining the outfield. I think that he should be moved back to third base, or first. He is one of the most consistent run producers in baseball. He takes the walk instead of swinging at bad ones.
