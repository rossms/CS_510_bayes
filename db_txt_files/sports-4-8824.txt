Probably the NBA's best pure shooter, Allen has beautiful form on his jumper, and his range extends to 25 feet easily. The best way to play him is to crowd him, get your hand in his shot pocket, make him force a shot or put it on the floor, but he's gotten better at catching and making a move to the basket, finishing hard. He's really at his best when they run him off multiple screens for his shot, and he will pull in a hurry. Quick release. I question whether he'll be the same guy coming back from injury, but as of now, when healthy, he's the best shooter in the east.
