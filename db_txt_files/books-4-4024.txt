I generally dislike George Orwell. I've read a few Orwell books, but the only reason I did myself that great disservice was because I enjoyed Animal Farm so much. Animal Farm was for me a dreadfully amusing look at Stalinistic Russia. Even if you don't realize that is the parallel to the story, it's still an entertaining metaphor for any modern nation.
