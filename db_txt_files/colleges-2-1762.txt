Back in the early and mid 1980s I was a mechanic at a gas station in Bronxville, NY which is very close to the Sarah Lawrence campus. A number of students were customers for both fuel and repairs. Almost without exception they were the most stuck up bunch of angry, cause driven, snotty women I ever had to deal with. The station I worked at closed down when Bronxville redeveloped that section of town. Good. Fix your own car, toots.
