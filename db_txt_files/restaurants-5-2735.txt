While you're ripping McDonald's, why not rip the good old US of A? Food quality is about a 4, but McDonald's stands for much more than just food: convenience, service, respect, fairness, baseball, etc. It's not my favorite fast food place, but it would be the one that would leave me the most sad if they went out of business.
