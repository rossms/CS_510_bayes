This book was funny! Fudge was my favourite character untill he ate dribble.Judy writes really good books! Theres another book after that one called superfudge and it's just as good! I don't think it's as good as the first, but there were afew good bits. Thanks Judy Blume! You write some wonderful stories! I would recommend this book for children and adults of all ages! *GO FUDGE*
