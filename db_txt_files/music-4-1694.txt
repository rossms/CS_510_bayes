A good,solid album from Chris Cornell and the very talented Musicians who made up most of Rage Against the Machine.Political,it's not- but packed with great music-yeah,baby!!!If you liked Soundgarden-this will surely satisfy.If you're a fan of Rage-check out how GOOD the Boyz sound with a frontman who can actually SING!
