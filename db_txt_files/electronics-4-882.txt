The design of the phone is probably best of all phones. Also, the phone has programs that you can run, such as games and stuff. It has a lot of other useful things like silent ring, a no hassel antenna, and easy rechargeable methods. It comes with inter-changeable faces so that I can change the color of the front part of the phone for a better style. The mic and ear piece is a little easier to use than others. The only bad thing is the vibrating battery you have to pay for.
