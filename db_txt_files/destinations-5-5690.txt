I cannot believe some people! Minnesota is a great place to live! It has several beautiful lakes. It is uncrowded. Has places to see like the boundary waters. And it may be cold in the winter but it is actually pretty hot in the summer. It was in the 90s half of the summer. So anyone who thinks they can judge minnesota and say people are rude think again go visit northern minnesota in the summer or central to southern in spring through october. It is a great place to live, and almost the whole state is very safe. By the way minneapolis may be a big city but it is one of the cleanest in the U.S.
