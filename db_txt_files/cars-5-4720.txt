I have owned 3 S-10s now and they, like most American vehicles, have spotty build quality. My new S10, a 99 S10 Xtreme, is the best vehicle I have ever owned. no major problems, handles great, great ride, comfortable, and quick. i have VERY pleased with teh Xtreme. Normal S10s I woudl rate at just OK.
