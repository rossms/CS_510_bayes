A very good coach who won a National Championship. He wins and he's stuck around at SU, which makes him underrated. He has been able to recruit top talent and plays an exciting brand of BBall. SU has developed a number of professional players and are always good in the Big East. Boeheim gets major props as a ladies man as well. He looks like a dork, but he's got a trophy wife and is said to be a ladies man.
