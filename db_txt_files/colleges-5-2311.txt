Not very well known but a great institution. Almost everyone who goes there deserves to be there. Athletic teams have to meet almost the same requirements. For example this year the recruits for a girls team this year must have an average sat of 1310. Greek life is big. Parties are even bigger. Kids like to party hard, study hard (well before a test). Lots of nice kids who are always genuinely friendly.
