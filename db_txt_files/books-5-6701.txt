Simply the best ever. My favorite novel of all time. An excellent story with intense characters. Everyone should read this book. Unfortunately, I couldn't really get into the sequel books as much, but I still think it's cool that Orson Scott Card lives in the city next to me (I live in the Winston-Salem/Kernersville area of NC; he lives in Greensboro, NC).
