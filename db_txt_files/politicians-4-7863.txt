He put the nation ahead of opinion polls, his party, or himself. He fought for civil rights when that was NOT popular for democrats or republicans. He threatened to send union workers on strike into the army if they continued to hold the nation's production of coal and rail work. He infuriated many in his own party and outside. He didn't care. He wanted what was best for America. If the democrats were full of Trumans today then I would still be one. He is one of my favorites.
