Law school is what you make of it. Wisconsin has lots of opportunities to make it right for you. The students are genuine, but also tough competition. The faculty is impressive. Career Services helped me a lot - they made every effort to help me find the perfect job. Moot court was a fantastic experience. And Madison is a great town.
