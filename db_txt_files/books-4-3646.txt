This ranks up there with The Truman Show and The Matrix for me in the sense that it lead me to doubt every aspect of existence and wonder about so many things. It's extremely well-written with amazing concepts and a crazy plot, I just subtract a star because there were many instances where Orwell described everything and drawled on and on. Plus, it's not the happiest read. Not that I'd expect it to be after reading the first page...
