Athens of the north is a beautiful city filled with history and spectacular views. Has a great zoo and Princess St. is the place for the serious shopper. Their is also the Castle and Holly Rood Palace. Best place to see the city is from Arthur's Seat which is an extinct volcano, the only one in Britain. Lots of things to see and do.
