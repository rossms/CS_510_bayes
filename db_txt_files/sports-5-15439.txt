I'm expecting a Shaq factor this season with the Randy Moss trade. Just like Shaq's departure hurt the Lakers and helped the Heat, I'm expecting Randy Moss' trade to skyrocket the Raiders to the top of the AFC, while the Vikings take a fall. Culpepper is a great player, but he was helped incredibly over his whole career by Moss' ability to get down the field and dominate weaker cornerbacks.
