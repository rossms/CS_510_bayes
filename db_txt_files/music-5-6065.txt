Probably the only record on earth that sounds great that has only cover songs. Metallica is a good band. So they have the ability to make good covers, and they have. That's how they started out touring having a third of their setlis filled with british metal and punk cover songs. Metallica has done a great job giving some old classics new life. A must for al Metallic, and any rck fan.
