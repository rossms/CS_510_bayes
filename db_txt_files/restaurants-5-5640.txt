This was the best meal I ate in Orlando! Yes, it's expensive, but the food is excellent, and the view is beautiful. Go for a late dinner, and watch the fireworks at the Magic Kingdom through the windows, or out on the roof (they turn the music down and pipe in the music when the fireworks start, so it's a good show).
