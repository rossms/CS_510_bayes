this comment is actually about Al Gore.It is november 27th and I just listened to Gores speech.In the first two minutes of the speech I thought he made aterrible mistake.He said that one day every 4 years the rich the poor the black and white are created equal. Now i was always taught that all men are created equal. I didnt know that meant all men are created equal one day every 4 years. I couldnt believe he said that but none of the news media said anything obout it
