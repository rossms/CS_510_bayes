Ok here me out on this one. Wade is a great player no doubt. He is good in all areas of the floor. He gets everyone else involoved in the game as well. That can be a good thing but i think in this case it is not. He is the best player on the team so he really needs to realize that and step up. As seen in the Kansas game in the final four he did not take the leadership position that he should have. When he took a shot most of them went in, but he did not take enough shots. He would be much better if he played more for himself and took all the shots he knows he can make.
