The state is not cheap to live in- especially from Worcester and on east and Cape Cod. High housing costs- and rising. For sure there is much in the way of cultural amenities- plus excellent local services, good roads, and quick access to the rest of New Englands major attractions.Western parts of the state, including the cities of Northhampton, Springfield and Amherst are lovely, and much cheaper.
