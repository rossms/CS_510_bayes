I usually don't buy regular potato chips because they're so high in fat, but I read about Terra Yukon Gold Potato Chips in Cooking Light and thought I'd give them a try. They're lower in fat than regular chips due to their thickness and how they're fried, and they taste great. The salt and pepper version is the best, in my opinion, but the other flavors are good, too. If you've been avoiding regular potato chips, give these a try. They're a welcome change from the cardboardy, tasteless healthy potato chips out there.
