This movie is definitely not for the faint of heart. It is incredibly intense right from the beginning and doesn't really let up throughout. Ed Norton is brilliant (as usual) as we see his transition to becoming a skinhead and, then, as a reformed citizen when he gets out of prison. You need to be in the right mood to see this film and it is sometimes pretty gory, but I definitely recommend it.
