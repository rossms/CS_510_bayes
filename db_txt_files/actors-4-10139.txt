she's very versatile, tackling just about any kind of role with convincing depth and a good mix of drama and humor. like the ball-busting hero in the Alien series, the villain in Working Girl, the first-lady in Dave, the blonde sex-symbol in Galaxy Quest. I think she's underrated, even though she seems to have bad fashion sense and sometimes picks bad roles...why she ever agreed to do the third and fourth alien movies (especially the fourth one) is beyond me.
