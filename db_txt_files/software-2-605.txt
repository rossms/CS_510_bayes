Very good editing and audio. A disaster trying to write to DVD. If you want total frustration, lack of technical support, and a bug loaded piece of software try Studio 8. If you use it to create a MPEG-2 file to be burned with the likes of Nero 5.5, it works ok but transitions do not work nor do menus.
