Wisconsin is under-rated. It has one of the prettiest cities in the country, Madison, and the northern parts of the state have lots of rolling hills, gorgeous forests, great biking, and beautiful river valleys. Yes, there's a big beer, brats, and the Green Bay Packers element, but overall the state is quite pretty.
