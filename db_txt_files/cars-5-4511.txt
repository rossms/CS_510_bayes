We purchased our 1999 Windstar in March of this year. So far we love it, and it's nice to know that we are driving a van that has the highest safety rating. It is very roomy and comfortable, and especially convenient with the extra sliding door on the driver's side. It's easy to get in and out of, and as someone with arthritis this was something that concerned me. Accessability was definitely high on our list of priorities, some vans you have to almost climb into but this one is just great!!! All in all, we LOVE it!! :o)
