This game is superb. Superior to all other games with the exception of Final Fantasy 2. Started the whole collection of Age of Empires. Addictive and long who could ask for more. Unlike marijuana this is legal. The pure ecstasy achieved when you raze a building or mow down priests cannot be parralelled by any other.
