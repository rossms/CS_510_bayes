This school community college alliance program has offered me a chance at earning a bachelor degree in computer science that I may not have otherwise had. i have not taken any of the online courses yet as I am still finshing up my bridge classes but I have found the staff every helpful and willing to listen to my concerns. I have no idea how the staff on campus may be. But the ones I have dealt with through thier community college alliance program are outstanding.
