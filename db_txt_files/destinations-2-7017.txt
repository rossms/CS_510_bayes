Aaaaaaarrrrgggghhhhh!!!! Too Hectic! Did you know more people live crammed into London than in the whole of Scotland? I'm English, so London isn't just another tourist destination for me. There are undeniably loads of things to do there, but it's too overcrowded, overpriced, the tube feels more like a cattle car at times and most of the buildings are ugly. Speaking as an ENGLISH person, Paris is much nicer.
