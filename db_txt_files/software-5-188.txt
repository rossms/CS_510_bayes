By far the best! It is extremely stable, and lets you either open up a completely new browser, or simply open up a tab. Very stable--I have never had this crash on me, even with tons of other programs open at the same time. Very secure, and offers all the options that Internet Explorer and Netscape have. By far the best, even though it is little-known. It runs on Windows, Linux, or the Mac, so it is also flexible.
