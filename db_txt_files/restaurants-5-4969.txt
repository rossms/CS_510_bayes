I like OG, always a good meal there, I find it is the entire combination of the food that makes it great, the salad, the yummy salad dresssing (which they sell by the bottle), the breadsticks, and the main course..all good, well prepared food. Maybe I am not a gourmand, but I like the food here, nice atmosphere and usually friendly staff.
