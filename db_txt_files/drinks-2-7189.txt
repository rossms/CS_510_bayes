I agree, the french may be good at champagne and wine (by the way, b/c of a fungus, any french wine after 1958 is actually from a transplanted California vine. The french hate that when you remind them.) but they're not very good at vodka. Grey Goose (particulary the Citron) has a distincly metallic aftertaste that almost tastes like medcine or a strong vitamin. For the price, spend the extra 5 bucks and go for Chopin. Besides Grey Goose is too mainstream to be exotic so don't bother using it as a display at a party.
