Cooper was and still is the king of shock rock. I saw him last year and this guy still puts on the most amazing shows and his last three albums have been as good as the classic 70's material. Check out The Last Temptation, Brutal Planet, and Dragontown! However, let's go back to the Nightmare CD from 1975. This is the king of all theatrical horror based CD's. Cooper sounds awesome and each song contributes to the story. It continues everything you would want in a rock masterpiece, especially Steven. The tour for this album is still the most respected in all of rock.
