i lived in st thomas for 3 months. i think the beaches are beautiful ( i was married on Magens Bay) jsut be careful where you stay. we lived downtown in charlotte amahlie. it was fun but i never felt safe walking home without my husband, even though we lived 2 blocks up from the main st. forget shopping here, it is a rip off if you travel here go to red hook, this is a fun part of the island. duffy's love shack is a restaurant that ends up with people dancing in the parking lot. beautiful but be safe
