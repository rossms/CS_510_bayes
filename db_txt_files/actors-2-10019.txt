Liked her FAR better as a late-teen scream queen (where the volume of her voice was SUPPOSED to be one-dimensional and shrill). Let herself go downhill bod-wise, but at least she had enough intelligence to realize she couldn't stay 23 forever. I'd shake her hand at a party, but strike up a conversation? Maybe I'll go try the crab dip.......
