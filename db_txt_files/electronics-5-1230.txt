My new best friend. I don't leave home without it. It has made this year bearable. My favorite music--to go. And I stress music. No more having to hear vulgar anti-music (bass heavy hip hop and rap) blaring out of cars. I'm in my own world. And it's great there. I have actually LOST WEIGHT because working out gives me an excuse to use my POD. GREAT GOING APPLE! Let's get more mini-IPOD colors---fire engine red, bright yellow and orange would be nice. Plus, the ability to move songs from the POD to iTUNES. Maybe their next generation will have this feature.
