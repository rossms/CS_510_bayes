Merits are good cigarettes. They have low tar and nicotine. They don't taste like regular Ultra Lights. They still hit the spot. If you smoke cigarettes, you'll understand that last sentence. The only bad thing is the box is light blue and it makes me think that I am smoking chick cigarettes. They are good but not super strong.
