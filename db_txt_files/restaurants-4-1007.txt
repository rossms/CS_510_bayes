I like Boston Market, I don't like the rotisserie chicken, but the other main dishes and side items are excellent. The employees are very attentive and friendly. My city there are only 2 restaurants left, the others have closed, I am not sure if maybe the prices have something to do with it, it is a little expensive for a fast-food type restaurant, but I think it is generally worth it.
