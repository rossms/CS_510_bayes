In his prime, he was a legitimate candidate for the best comedian of all time. He can still deliver the goods, witness The Nutty Professor. I would strongly recommend Beverly Hills Cop, 48 Hours, and the all-time comedy classic Trading Places. Murphy was too good for Saturday Night Live, and proved it with his first batch of movies. I'd love to see him regain the consistency he once had.
