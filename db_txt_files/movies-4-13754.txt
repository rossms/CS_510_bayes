I was a huge fan of this book and thankfully this film only let me down slightly. The casting for Green Mile was really what set it apart; every actor fit his role to a T. Tom Hanks, one of the best actors of our time, gave a solid, believable performance again. Michael Clarke Duncan was specatcular; it was almost as if he was tailor-made for that heart-breaking role. While there was something I can't quite pick out that didn't equal the book, it was, in essence, as wonderful and touching.
