Like just about every Latin American capital, Quito is dirty and chaotic, and if you're coming from the U.S. or Europe, the degree of poverty may get you down. That said, it's a beautiful city. Ecuadoreans tend to be decent, the older parts of the city are charming, and the surrounding mountains are beautiful. When I was last there in the early nineties, it seemed quite safe, but I've heard that kidnappings have increased, so use common sense.
