A great American City. Lots of sports, lots of beer and lots of good people. This city may not be jammed packed with museums and other cultural attractions but it's still a fun place to visit and a great place to live. By the way the way browngirl saying that Milwaukee is more racist than the south is laugable. Where exactly did you live in the south, NEVERLAND?
