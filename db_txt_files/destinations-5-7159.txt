Madrid is a surprisingly nice capital city. I wasn't expecting much out of it when I first came, but it had a lot more than I realized. The archecture is really nice. The Prado is nice, the center town plaza has got a lot of little cafes where you can get some good tapas and booze for very cheap. The Palacio Real is beautiful (the royal residence of the Spanish Monarchy). The distribution of the city is great, not too big and not too small. The public monuments add a lot to the city.
