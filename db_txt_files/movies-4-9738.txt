Defintely a good movie. Bruce Willis is superb as usual, and the supporting cast is very good. Amanda Peet is just to hot and adds a female dimension which was needed. Probably not a movie for the kids, though not much profanity or violence, it does contain full female nudity and sexual content. For those of you who would be intersted this is a fantastic movie.
