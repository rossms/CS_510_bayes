Ok, I admit that he is not a complete catastrophe, musically.But what is realy bad is that he represents what is bad about music today: lack of originality,big image-little music,lots of publicity-no artistry.He and other products are stopping real artists to be at least heard.So, for all the Justins and Madonnas of the world: retire and let real music be heard.
