I really like Minnie. I was surprised by her ability to play Benny in Circle of Friends. The book describes Benny as overweight, and not the prettiest thing. Since I think Minnie Driver is very attractive, I wondered if she could pull this off. However, she did. Her acting ability overcame her looks and she WAS Benny. I also enjoyed her in Good Will Hunting.
