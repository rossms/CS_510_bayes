The second best film about a superhero. Tobey Maquire was perfect as Peter Parker. Willem Dafoe goes a little overboard as the Green Gobblin. Kirsten Dunst is wonderful as Mary Jane Watson. In his short time in the film Cliff Robertson is not forgotten as Uncle Ben and sets the stage for Peter to become the hero. Story becomes weak and silly in some parts, but still manages to entertain.
