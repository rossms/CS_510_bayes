I hated this car until my wife made me drive it. Most comfortable car I have ever ridden in. We have a break squeal that the dealer has tried everything to get rid of. The squeal is the result of semimettalic break shoes and there is nothing that can be done about it. I am an enginer involved with mass transit systems and understand this since we spent many hours trying to get the squeal out in Sna Paulo, BART and Wamata.
