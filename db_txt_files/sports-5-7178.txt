I must say:I am not MJs fan. But he deserve for the biggest glory from all sports fans.He destroyed my best players:first- The Magic , then:Shaq, Penny, Reggie, Karl- he killed all my best players.I hate him for this, but I love his actions, jump shoots and overall skills, I must confess,MJ is the best ever. Unfortunatelly for my Reggie...
