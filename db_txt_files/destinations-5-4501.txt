I think Atlanta is awesome. I mean a lot of epople from up north wanna trash Atlanta and stuff. Obviously though, they've never been to it. Atlanta has so much going on just like a city should. It's home of the Atlanta Braves who rock, also, the CNN center, Coca-Cola, home of SO SO DEF productions, and also site of the Centinnial Olympic Park.....plus a lot more. So before you people start to dump trash talk on Atlanta, I think you need to check it out and realize its a city like other cities....except New york has ruder people!
