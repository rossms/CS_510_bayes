You haven't really lived until you've gone on the Xtreme Skyflyer at PKI. It's an awesome park with great coasters. The Beast is by far the best in the park, and Flight Of Fear, Face-Off, Son of Beast, Racer, and Top Gun are all exhilerating. Delirium, the park's newest attraction, is a giant, spinning Frisbee-thing attatched to a swing that goes up 13 stories, and it's terrific. Just don't go on Vortex, because it will ruin your entire experience.
