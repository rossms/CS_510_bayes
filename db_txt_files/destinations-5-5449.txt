Rhode Island rocks. The beaches are awesome. The resturants are all great. I usually go every year. I like to go to Point Judith and go deep sea fishing. I also love going to Block Island. Rhode Island may be small, but it is a beautiful state. I live in NY, about 70 miles north of New York City. So a trip to RI is about 3 and a half hrs.
