I love the cap'n (especially Peanut Butter Crunch) but I just can't eat these. I find the crunchberries give the cereal this weird way too sugary taste and I love sugary cereals normally. I could eat Kellogg's Smorz's for the rest of my life and be fine even though most ppl find it too sweet so I was really surprised when I didn't like crunch berries.
