Not a very good movie. Maybe the younger crowd may like this. A high school kid wants to get into Stanford. the school counseler sends the wrong transcript and he does not get in. He comes from a dysfunctional family{so what else is new?] a pot head brother, a nice girlfriend, etc. the movie follows him trying to get into Stanford.with not very funny scenes. pretty predictable movie that just is not funny. tries to be but falls short. I never really found myself rooting for the main character,I did not care if he made it into Stanford or not.
