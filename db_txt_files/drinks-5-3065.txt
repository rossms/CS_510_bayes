A great energy drink, origionally from Europe. In fact I first tried it in Germany. Tastes a bit different; extremely sweet. But it gives a lot of energy. The first night I tried it I just burst out laughing for no reason while playing Uno. Anyway, I recommend it personally. As it happens, nearly all people hate the taste and just drink for the energy or as a mixer. I happen to be a bit different in that I like the taste. Give it a try.
