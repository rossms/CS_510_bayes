Gerard was truly an obtuse young man. Both an anal burn and noble head cashier who loved his position with rancor for the world, and a sensual poet. He was always pushing me to read Mann, he especially loved The Magic Mountain but thought one should start with Death in Venice. I still haven't read the The Magic Mountain and I don't talk to Gerard anymore.
