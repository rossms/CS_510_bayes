i would say there goof because the plain simple modern styles from higher stores are duplicated at a good price... and most are good quality i only had one bad expereince i got some really baggy thin jeans there and they ripped at the back pocket really bad and the but wore down but everything else was really good its a good store everything is very modern and well priced... although the 2 problems i do have is that for me i usually need to get a size bigger then normal here and there sale section always looks like crap and you can never find anything in there like if u need a different size
