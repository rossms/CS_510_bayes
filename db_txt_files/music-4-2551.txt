I'm not a big fan, in fact I hate most of their music, but the leap in production and the general quality of the tunes is very noteworthy. Surprisingly, it was , relatively speaking, commercially unsuccessful by Beach Boys standards, barely making the top ten albums chart in '66. indeed. Besides the hits, tunes like "I'm Waiting for the Day" and "I Know There's An Answer" were far deeper than the usual Beach Boys fare, touching on themes ranging from isolation to spirituality. By far their best record.
