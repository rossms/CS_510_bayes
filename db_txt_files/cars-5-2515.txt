I have had my Supra for a few months now and it is a fantastic and very reliable sports car. Mine is an 87 MKIII and people still ask me on the road what kind of car it is and I have even had a few offers from people to buy it on the spot but I just can't sell it. The car is just too cool. Toyota made a huge mistake not continuing to import them into the US and really need to start again and go back to the MKIII body style...
