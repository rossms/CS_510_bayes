I can't give Kerry anything higher than 2 stars, as he's turning what should be a cakewalk of an election into a real race. If I could lower both my rating for Bush and Kerry, I would, but I can't give Bush 0 or negative stars, so I have to give Kerry at least 2. The best I can say is hopefully with a split congress and white house, the lunatics at the fringes of both parties will end up marginalized. Summary: Bad, but how can you possibly be worse than abysmal?
