I was too young to see Wilt Chamberlain as a 40 PPG scorer (I saw him in his role as a Laker where he was more of a playmaker). But I can imagine his game must have been something like Shaq Diesel when he is on. He is just too big and strong for anyone to contain. Three rings for the Lakers; also got the woebegone Magic to the NBA Finals when he was a little Diesel. Shaq is a true mason (bricklayer) at the charity stribe; but so was Chamberlain (who barely shot over 50%).
