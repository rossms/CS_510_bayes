A very well done movie. The acting was superb, except for the fighting scenes. Stonewall Jackson and Robert E. Lee were the best of the cast. AAAron, how does the movie in any way depict southerners as arrogant, far right religous zealots? Actually, the southerners win all of the battles in the movie. If there is any bias in the movie, its toward the north. Every time a Yankee shot his gun, no rebels would fall down. Every time a rebel shot, like 10 Yankees would die. Other than that, and 4 rather boring hours, Gods and Generals is a good historical film about the beginning of the Civil War.
