This was a fun summer movie, but it really lacks alot of the excitement and high concept of the 1st one. (I've never seen Lost World). It seemed to me like it was just another dinosaur v. human movie that will make alot of money and generate some hype, but it just won't be hailed as a 'great motion picture'. And that is what JP III was. I enjoyed it, to be sure, but the concept was kind of weak.
