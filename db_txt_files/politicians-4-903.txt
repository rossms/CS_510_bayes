A fine and principled man, who unfortunately has a job herding cats. The organization he heads has a history of varying effectiveness--often directly related to how much support it gets from the United States. Kofi has done a pretty good job of keeping the various bickering members together in spite of the sometimes immature behavior of its most powerful member.
