These dinners have saved my life. Well atleast made me very happy and healthy. Every one I have had is perfect. They do not taste like a frozen dinner. They really do taste like homemade. Also great price and I have a small microwave and they fit perfect. As they used to say on tv in the 70's Try it you will like it!.
