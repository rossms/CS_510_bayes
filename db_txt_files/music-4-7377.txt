I remember being in 8th grade, sleeping over a friends house and staying up until like Midnight or something to see the first showing of the Thriller video. I think it was on Friday Night Videos or something like that. At the time it seemed pretty incredible and is still a pretty fun little short but the best part was definitely Vincent Price, that guy had the creepiest voice going.
