Curtis is one of the most durable and reliable backs in the NFL. He doesn't fumble and can catch the ball out of the backfield. Just put him in the backfield, hand him the ball all year and he'll end up with 1,200 yards. He is going to help the Jet offense put up some serious points this year even without Keyshawn.
