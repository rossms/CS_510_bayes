The fattest state in the country, literaly. I believe I read somewhere that about 1 in 5 of all obese Americans live in Texas. Houston and San Antonio are the 1st and 3rd fattest cities respectively. I wonder, if we gave it back to Mexico (which ia already essentialy reclaiming about 90% of it), would America be the fattest country in the history of the world anymore?
