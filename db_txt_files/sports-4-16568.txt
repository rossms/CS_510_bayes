I love this back. He is a punishing runner who rarely goes down on the first hit. He is a smooth receiver who can make people miss in the open field. He plays hard on the field, and keeps himself out of trouble off of it. For once it appears the Eagles made a good personnel decisiion by keeping Staley, and drafting McNabb and not Ricky Williams. I will knock his rating up to a five if Staley makes the Eagles competitive week in and week out this season.
