I had never been to a cheesecake factory before, so when I went on vacation recently, I planned on getting a slice of cheesecake. My husband and I didn't sit down, we just ordered cheescake to go at the counter. I had the peanut butter cup fudge ripple and I thought it was excellent. Very rich but very good.
