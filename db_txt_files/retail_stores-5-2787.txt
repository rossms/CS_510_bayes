I bought an engagement ring and a wedding band for my fiance at Samuels. The staff was extremely helpful, the prices could not be beat (and we sure shopped a lot of stores). I was impressed with the it's my pleasure service and the knowledgable personnel. I highly recommend Samuels. I purchased the warranty on both items. I do hope that if the need ever arises that I will get better warranty service than reported by others who have rated samuels poorly.
