Louisville is not the best city I have been in, but it is certainly not the worst. Louisville has a very nice downtown(new convention center and nice resturants, crappy library though), especially Old Louisville and Bardstown Road near downtown are just excellent. Louisville has some very nice three story houses and is kept fairly tidy. All and all, I wouldnt make a special trip to Louisville, but it is a very nice city for the region and suprisingly is almost as big as Indianapolis.
