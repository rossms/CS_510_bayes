I worked at a summer camp where Britney got a lot of air time and I was personally saddened that the children had so much exposure to this crap. Do people actually like her music, or did she just have a good plastic surgeon? Her lyrics are terrible, the music is noisy and unpleasing to the ear and the whole concept of Britney is degrading to women. I guess you can dance to it, if you're into pop culture and acting slutty.
