People sometimes forget what separates rock legend Alice Cooper from other hard rockers (saw the guy recently and he still has it). Cooper is a bonafide star on stage and on his best works it comes across on album/CD. WTMN is one of his finest moments. It is a truly brilliant conceptual piece with a variety of songs. It proved that Alice was more than a one trick pony and any serious rock fan would own this album.
