I love this crazy dude. His new faux mohawk makes him look like a malnourished, 6'10 bird. Those of you that are involved with fantasy basketball knows that this guy is God. Typical stat line for Kirilenko: 6/11 FGM, 4/4 FT, 2/3 3PT, 9 rbs, 5 asts, 6 stls, 4 blks. His stat lines are as bizarre as his persona. The fact that he lives in Salt Lake City and plays for the Jazz just adds to the surreal nature of it all.
