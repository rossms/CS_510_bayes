This is the first tape that I ever owned and I still stand by it. One of the most memorable bands, it is here to stay forever. With tracks like, Welcome to the Jungle , Paradise City , Sweet Child of Mine and many more, it's just great. If you like rock metal, you probably own it already. If you don't, what's wrong with you? Go get it!
