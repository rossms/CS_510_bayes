I think that Steve Nash proved during this year's playoff run why he was chosen as the NBA's MVP. Whether it was passing the ball, rebounding, or scoring, he did what it took to help his team win. They may still be playing if Joe Johnson hadn't been hurt, but the turnaround which he helped lead in Phoenix was impressive, and they have to be one of the frontrunners in the NBA again next season.
