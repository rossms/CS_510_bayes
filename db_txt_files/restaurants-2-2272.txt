I enjoy eating at the Captain D's in Fort Payne, AL. However I just ate at the location on Sycamore View in Memphis, #6107. The fish tasted like it was cooked erlier in the day and warmed over. The service was slow. I waited approximatley 20 minutes for my food. I asked to speak to the manager, but one never came to talk to me. The employees were basically friendly. I think they need some management and training from the franchize.
