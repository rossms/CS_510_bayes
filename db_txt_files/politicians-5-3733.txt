I have watched in awe the last few days of media mayhem led by Gore- and I appreciate the fact the PRESIDENT ELECT BUSH- has the humility to keep a low profile in the face of this feeding frenzy. I applaud the way that he has handled the entire situation. And as far as the way Jeb has handled his state- as well as Former President Bush- well is shows that this is a FIRST CLASS FAMILY. Which is something that this country sorely needs- a true family that shows true family values. Keep fighting for what is right- not what you WANT to be right and you will suceed.
