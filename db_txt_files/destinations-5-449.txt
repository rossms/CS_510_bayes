Barbados is ABSOLUTELY BEAUTIFUL (friendly people, wonderful music, beautiful weather and beaches.) The best way to experience the island (or any other country) is not to jump on the all-inclusive band-wagon.They seclude you and create a false luxury environment. Rather, stay in a relatively small hotel where you can step outside easily and experience true local cuisine, culture, and the lively spirit of the island.
