Mike Piazza only number 17 on this list???? You have got to be kidding me. He is hitting .370 and once again carrying an average Mets lineup. Although not even in the same universe defensively as I-Rod, Piazza is still the Man when it comes to hitting catchers-- or hitters in general. The greatest hitting catcher of all time should be ranked higher.
