Front Page is by far the best choice if you need to create a web site, have limited time to learn a program, and don't want to spend a fortune. I highly recommend it. It may very well be the best product Microsoft has ever created. Although Front Page has been my web editor of choice since it was introduced nearly 7 years ago, I recently switched to JP Namo Web Editor 6.0 which offers a more robust kernel, and allows for greater integration with third party components.
