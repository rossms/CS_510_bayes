Although you knew who would be the the survivor in the end it was still good. I thought that Geoffery Rush was great in it! This movie reminds me of the haunted Cresent Hotel in Eureka Springs, Arkansas. That was once a hospital and it is very haunted now. If you don't believe in ghosts, you will after you spend a couple of days there. Of course, nothing happened like it did in the movie, but I guarentee a spook or two.
