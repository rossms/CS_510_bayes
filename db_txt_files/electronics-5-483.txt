This model of portable, recordable mini-disc player is the only product I would recommend more than the Diamond Rio series, inportable media. The mini-disc recorder matches the Rio's small size and convenience, but surpasses the Rio by being able to record media from any available input, not just mp3's (which a MP player can record as well).
