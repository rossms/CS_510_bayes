I had seen this thing before and I knew how much it stunk. It actually lead to a tragedy! My dog, Fido, and I have a habit of watching televison. He and I were watching cable the other day and I was pulling on a few brewskis and rested my eyes. When I woke up, the credits were running on this turkey. I looked over at Fido, and his eyes were rolling back in his head. He got the runs so bad, I have to feed him cheese for a week!
