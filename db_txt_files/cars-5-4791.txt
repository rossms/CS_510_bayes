overall, great truck. yellow full edge plus package. milage 12,000 20-22/mpg, comfortable even with along drive. 3.0l automatic. smooth shift, good acceleration. suspension excellent. interior okay. maybe trays under seat. i have had chevy, dodge, and ford. ford best overall, and bang for the buck it would be hard to beat. after one month of shopping i could not find anything, even close. one more thing, this is a head turner, males and females alike.
