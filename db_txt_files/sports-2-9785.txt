First of all t-mac, they didn't get swept. they might as well have, though. LA's glory days are over. Jackson and Shaq are gone. Kobe might go because he's a level 3 sex offender:) malone is old and is gonna retire. That leaves payton and possibly kobe. Two guards won't get you anywhere in today's nba. And to top it off, since the lakers were in the finals, they got crappy draft picks. That means there isn't any room for improvement. They'll probably be average at best for the next few years.
