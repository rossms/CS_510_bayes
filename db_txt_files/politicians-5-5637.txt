A great politician and even better person! She has fought for children's rights, health care, education, and the environment. Just look at the reasons people hate her: she's sneaky (why? because she doesn't trust the press? Gee, I wonder why!), she's a lesbian (first of all, so what if she is, second...why? because she's a strong woman?!), she's a liar (as if she's the only one to claim that the Republicans aren't telling the truth!)...all anti-Hillary reasoning is completely illogical and sophomoric. Hillary for Prez 2008!
