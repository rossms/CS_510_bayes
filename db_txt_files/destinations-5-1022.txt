A naturally beautiful country with freindly people with very similar attitudes to Brits and Canadians. Countless unbelieveable beaches and many sunny days means a good place to holiday, and some very beautiful, modern cities with surprisingly big skylines (Sydney, Brisbane, Melbourne, Cairns and Perth are the nicest). The only bad things are bitey animals, and long distances to travel between places.
