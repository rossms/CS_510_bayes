We, French people, seem so stupid in this movie that it is chocking. Can you imagine seing a movie which takes place in The USA without seing one American? I know we owe you a lot, but please, Mr Spielberg, go back to movies such as Schindler's list . The one thing I've liked in this movie is the twenty first minutes, but what follows is really unbelievable!
