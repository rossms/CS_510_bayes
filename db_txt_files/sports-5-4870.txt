Coach Sendek is not only a VERY GOOD coach, he is a GREAT person.Do you packfans remember where our program was BEFORE he arrived.You ALL have VERY SHORT MEMORIES. Our best regular season since 74 and you are still unhappy.3trips in a row to the NCAA's. Get over it. Why don't all of YOU leave and become bandwagon UNC or Duke fans because Herb is the man.He SAVED NCSU's program.Without him, we would be Clemson.No offense Clemson fans.
