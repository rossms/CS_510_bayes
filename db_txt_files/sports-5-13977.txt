Quickest back ever and he never fumbled. He was a classy but weird guy and I don't think he really enjoyed playing the game. It sucked how he bailed out on the Lions but for a number of years he made them a better team than they should of been and if he'd been with the Cowboys he might have had a 3000 yard season.
