My bro had an A4, with the dealer sports package It kicked ass! He was the only one able to keep up with me in my FD! Of course it was raining and the Quattro helped him a LOT kick ass in rain (o: and is perfect conflict between sport and luxury But don't ride it too hard though cause you'll break it and Audi won't fix it undfer warranty )o: boooooh for Audi!
