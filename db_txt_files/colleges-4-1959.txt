This is a great university for serious students. A science/engineering students will benefit greatly from the breadth of research conducted and condition of lab resources. Education quality is very high for those serious to learn and both the campus and city are beautiful. If you come to party, you likely will, and thus will receive a poor education and a prolonged hangover.
