Tom Hanks is, as we have come to expect, excellent. He is very convincing as a man who went from manipulating time, to being a prisoner of it. The crash scene makes you question if you ever want to fly over water again . . . if at all! And the ending . . well, not storybook maybe, but not unexpected.
