Remember 9-11, did you think we would have gone 23 months without another attack? Do you really think Al Gore would have been up to the job? I find myself asking questions these days because I can't understand the bitterness of the democrats. I hope to never have a one term president the rest of my life. I am an American and always want to see our country do well. For one to do well personally I think you need to concentrate on the positive opportunities in youre life. Those that dwell on defeat become bitter isolated and dangerous.
