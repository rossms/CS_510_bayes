funny movie. Joe pesci and Marisa tomei are both great in their roles. vinny is a brand new lawyer who comes down south to defend a cousin who wrongly got arrested for murder. he brings his girlfriend Lisa with him.Vinny and Lisa are from Brooklyn NewYork, and are fish out of water down south in Alabama. Fred Gwynne is good as the hard care southerner judge who shows a lot of contempt for Vinny. A lot of real funny scenes.
