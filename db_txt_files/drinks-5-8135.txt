The Kendall Jackson Cabernet Sauvignon (1997 Vintner's Reserve) is excellent. I hate describing the taste of wine because I'm not very good at it and I think it usually sounds pretentious. So, here you go- this wine tastes great! I think you could serve it with almost anything. It's inexpensive, too ($10.99 at a discount liquor store), so you can't go wrong.
