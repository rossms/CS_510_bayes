Good book. It is filled with tragedy and some humor.Frank McCourt's autobiography of his childhood in Ireland. McCourt talks of his childhood of poverty, it has a lot of sadness since some of his siblings died very young. He was always hungry and his dad was an alcoholic.this is an honest telling of his life as a child, even though he had a lot of tragedy in his life, he also found some humor too. I would really give this about a 4.5, a good book.
