A great and profound psychological study; it is so realistic and precise in its insights that I find it extremely uncomfortable to read. That said, for some reason I have made four tries to get through it, and have never been able to finish, and I'm not sure why. I think I like the first half, but then when it becomes a solve the crime tale I lose interest. The inner dialog in Raskolnikov's mind during the murder and immediately after is unlike anything else I have ever read; amazing.
