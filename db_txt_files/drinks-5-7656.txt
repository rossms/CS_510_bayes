This is a wonderful sipping whiskey. I usually drink the 1.75 liter George Dickel, which is smooth enough for a very pleasant drink. This one is like sipping brandy. Whenever it goes to $20 @ BevMo, we buy a case and sip it over a year. We were reared on Old Crow and still love it for a mixed drink or with soda, but Geo.D and Knob Hill beat all for simple coddling in your glass over debates about politics and books..
