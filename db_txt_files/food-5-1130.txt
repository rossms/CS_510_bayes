If they were good enough for E.T., then they're good enough for me. How could you resist that thin candy shell that melts away to unleash a unique peanut butter taste? M M tried to come out with their own version of Reeses Pieces but nothing compares to the original. Only downside is that one must consume by the handful (at least five or six at a time) in order to achieve maximum satisfaction. Not always a pretty picture --but the deliciousness that is a Reeses Piece definitely makes it worth your while to look like a starved candy fiend!
