Mention the name Jane Fonda and you stir up a hornet's nest of controversy. Her political views have offended millions. Ms. Fonda is first and formost an actress. That's how I choose to see her. she is a very talented oscar winning actress. I always find her performances believable and satisfying. I admire the fact that she is so versatile. Whether it's a comedy or drama, this lady gives it her all and it shows in her performances. That's good enough for me!
