Does my heart good to see someone vote their conscience instead of the strict party line. Democrats think it's a major sin that Miller spoke out in favor of the president, but condoned it when Jim Jeffords switched parties, calling him a national hero. Hypocrites! This nation needs more good, southern democrats!
