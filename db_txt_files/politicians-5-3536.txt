I believe that George W. Bush was destined to be president right now because God knew he had the moral fiber and intestinal fortitude to take care of the evil that's going on in the Middle East. It's not just a physical war. It's also a spiritual war. We all should be praying for him instead of knocking him down. God bless our leader.
