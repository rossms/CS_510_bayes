Cool clothes, but I wasn't allowed to go in because I was supposedly too skinny . What the hell?!?!?!?!? I take a size 9 and I'm accused of being anorexic! Jeez! So I was really angry because not many stores are made for very busty girls like myself and I had been looking for stores that were. So I wasn't exactly pleased. Plus, All of the plus size models weren't plus size. I've seen Versace models with bigger hips.
