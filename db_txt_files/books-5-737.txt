This is an imaginative little adventure, featuring a humble little cricket who endears himself into even the toughest of hearts. I remember reading this when I was seven, and even then I appreciated the attention to detail and the fun and gruff characters who live in this little world. I'm 22, and I still have my worn and ragged copy of that book. This is something that I think many children can enjoy.
