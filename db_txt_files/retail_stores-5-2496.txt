Safeway is consistently a good grocery store - much better than the other big chains. I generally hate it when you have to get a membership card of any kind to participate in discounts, but since Safeway's card takes the place of the even-more-annoying coupons, I was happy to join. Now I just give the card to the checkout person, and I end up saving something like $5-10 on an average grocery store trip. Not bad. And Safeway always seems to have the stuff I'm looking for, while places like Cala Foods (here in California) or Winn-Dixie always seem to be missing things.
