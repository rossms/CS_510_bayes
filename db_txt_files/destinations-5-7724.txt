On the Washington DC site, people commented on the National Mall as being patriotic and how wonderful it was. But, it's man-made, long after the fact. The Freedom Trail is history, yours and mine. It's a place to walk and to experience how America grew to become a country - a great country. You see landmarks that are landmarks not because they were built to represent history, but because they are history. It's as American as any 2.5 miles in the US. And, it's there because it happened.
