Glorifies the discredited Jim Garrison and his crack-brain theories. I suppose the illiterate morons who watch this drivel consider it to be gospel. The jury on this case was out about one hour. I would assume it took that long to elect a foreman, everyone to use the john, and the smokers to have a break. It probably took the jury 10 seconds to decide on the facts.
