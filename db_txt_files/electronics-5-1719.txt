Receiving it for my Birthday, I am very pleased with my new VCR. My previous VCR (a Sanyo) went on the fritz by everything I recorded looked like the vertical alignment was messed up. JVC wins here. The automatic tracking feature is a charm. Although the clicker is small, it works fine. Programmed recordings come out clear and the pause-recording feature works great for cutting out commercials! It also has great inputs for a satellite unit or a video game system. Highly recommended!
