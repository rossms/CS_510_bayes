Mine has been a good performer for four going on five years now. I dig the function that lets you locate the peak volume on a particular track, which is important when assembling mix tapes. However, the basic skip forward or back should not be buried among the special functions (you program which ones you want easily accessible). That makes it tough for visitors to figure out.
