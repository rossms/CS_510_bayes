I really believe that this CD is for those who value stong, meaningful lyrics. It's certainly not a party CD, but it is best listened to on a rainy day or long bus ride. I find I enjoy this CD the most when I'm in a relaxed, pensive mood. Apple goes from really fast, mixed beats, like in her Fast As You Can track, to her sullen yet hopeful track of Crowbar. My favorite line on the whole CD is in the song, that I think is titled, Not Baby Anymore and she says, nobody sees when you are lying in your bed and I wanna' crawl in with you, I want your warmth but it will only make me colder when it's over....
