The great Jimmy Foxx was a fearsome slugger who had the greatest combination of power and hitting average. Often referred to as the 'Right-Handed Babe Ruth', Jimmy Foxx and the Philadelphia Athletics brought havoc in an era which was dominated by Ruth's Yankees for American League supremacy. Unfortunately, Double-X would be largely forgotten when he died in 1974 of alcoholism. But not even Babe Ruth could be called in the roll of Triple Crown winners, of which Jimmy Foxx figures most prominently. Modest and down to earth, Foxx was simply one of the best to ever play the game.
