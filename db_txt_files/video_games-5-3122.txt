I haven't played Tony Hawk 4 yet, but Tony Hawk 3 was the best yet when it came out. Smoooooth graphics, manuals, reverts and more help this game blow the first two out of the water. I can't even play the first two anymore because they're just too damn slow compared to THPS3, and the lack of manuals and reverts is extemely frustrating once you've already gotten used to doing them in the newer game.
