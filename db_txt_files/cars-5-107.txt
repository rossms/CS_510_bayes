I don't think it will ever walk a built banshee, but that's only becase banshee's are 2 stroke. the 450 is great and I have never ridden a better quad. Yamahas just seem wierd to me. a banshee has nothing on the 450 R when it's doing anything but a straight line. not to say that the 450 is slow, it's just not a 2 stroke. If you want to smoke a banshee, build up a 2 stroke 250R, or put a suzuki 700 cc engine out of an arctic cat m7/f7 and build a drag quad
