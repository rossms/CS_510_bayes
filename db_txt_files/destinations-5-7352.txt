Not only is it an attractive and charming small city (pop. 120,000) in its own right, it's also probably the best home base for spending a few days in Switzerland. The Bernese Oberland, the most popular mountain area, is an hour away by train. So is the eastern shore of Lake Geneva (more worth visiting than Geneva itself). So is the similarly attractive but pricier city of Lucerne. You get the picture.
