This is a new version of Cinderella with Drew Barrymore as Cinderella. I really liked this movie. I thought it was a good story as a little girl and then seeing the story re-told, I liked it. The costumes were great. Drew did a wonderful job, same with the wicked step mother (I forget her name but she was great). It is a great movie to rent during the winter.
