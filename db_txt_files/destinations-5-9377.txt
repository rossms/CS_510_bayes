Mexico is both exciting and wonderful and Chichen Itza is at the top of the list of sites in Mexico I would like to see again. We stayed in a hacienda not far from the site, once owned by the University of Pennsylvania,and at night walked along a jungle path to a sound a light show at the pyramids which suddenly loomed in front of us. I'll never forget that moment and the feeling of being part of another century.
