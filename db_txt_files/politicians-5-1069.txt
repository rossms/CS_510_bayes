Mr. Sharon is the man of the hour. He is a needed element in gleaning peace from the quagmire that Mr. Barak got his country into. A nation can only gain peace through strength. The U.S. would surly not survive long if we decided to get along with every other nation, at all cost. Mr. Sharon has proven himself a strong and willing leader of Israel. My hope is he will continue to lead unfalteringly and with wisdom as his predecessor led with uncertainty and little good judgment.
