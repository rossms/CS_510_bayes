Are the Jets the team of destiny? They are 4-0 against some tough teams, but have yet to play a good or complete game. With Testeverde struggling, Curtis Martin has been incredible and the defense has been tremendous. And, Al Groh seems to be pushing all of the right buttons. Maybe, their good luck will catch up with them and they won't continue to be as fortunate. But, if Vinny begins to play better, they won't need the good luck and they'll begin to win games convicingly. As a result, without a dominant team in the AFC, the Jets could be headed to Tampa come the end of January.
