I did get a wonderful options package which might be a deciding factor, but I had a mechanical Dad and a picky daughter along for the original test ride, and it was a very quick concensus that - this is the car! It was smooth, comfortable, great to handle, and nice to look at too! Oh yes, economical was another factor.
