A good movie that is almost, but not quite, great. I like Harrison Ford in just about everything he does, and he's excellent as the wrongly accused doctor who hunts the one-armed man. There are some great action scenes (the train wreck is especially impressive), and there's enough suspense to keep you engaged throughout the entire movie. Not to mention Tommy Lee Jones, who is especially good as the U.S. Marshall who chases Ford. But, while this movie does everything well, it's not a movie that sticks with you when you leave the theater. Just good entertainment - nothing more or less.
