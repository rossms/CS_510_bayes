I was looking for a software that would allow me to down load information from my different accounts (e.g. 401s, 403s, credit unions, brokerage accounts etc...) automatically. Unfortunately it appears that Quicken does not support most of my financial institutions. If you are looking for this feature and have a complicated financial picture you should look else were. A spread sheet software with a Morningstar subscription will be better in tracking your overall financial picture.
