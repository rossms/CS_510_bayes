Underrated. Cleveland has all the museums and big city stuff you could ever want and the best Polish food in the country. Columbus has a massive university, a stable economy and is without a doubt one of the liveable cities in North America with the beautiful tree lined streets. South-western Ohio has excellent hiking with the hills.
