It's tough to say that he gets overlooked when folks talk about the best player in the NBA, but I think he does. If he isn't the best all-around player in the league, he is damn close. His offensive skills are tremendous (he can shoot the J, lead the break, take it to the hole), but what separates him from the rest of the non-centers is his ability on the defensive end. Defensive is all about effort and smarts, two areas in which Kobe excels every night.
