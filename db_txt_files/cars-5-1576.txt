Rented one for a week in Houston and I must say this is one great car. Had the 280hp v8. Good looks, extremely fast, quiet very luxurious interior with an awesome sound system. Great handleing and power. Interior was top notch with real wood and great leather seats. Love the chrome dual exhaust tips. Just love this little Lincoln.
