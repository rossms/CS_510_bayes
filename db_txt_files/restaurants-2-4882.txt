Another places that practices discriminatory hiring. Usually you'll see only white preps working there, or minorities that fit that mold. The food is pretty much the same as the rest of these clone restaurants, but I feel their hiring practices are disturbing. Famous Dave's is an excellent restaurant that hires fairly, and I actually get great, friendly service. I wish a lot of the restaurants of this sort would stop the cliqueish hiring.
