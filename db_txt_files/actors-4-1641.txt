Denzel Washington is one of those actors who I liked a lot better before I heard him interviewed. As an actor he's very good, I don't think he deserved the oscar for training day, he's done better, the bone collector was great, much better. In the several interviews I've listened to with him he comes across as arrogant, a real jerk. That's why I don't read People or watch Entertainment Tonight. I'd rather know them as their characters than as themselves if they're going to act like egotistical jerks.
