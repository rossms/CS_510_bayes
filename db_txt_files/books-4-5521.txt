Rich with metaphor and symbolism, Blindness is a contemporary peer of Albert Camus' The Plague. It is disturbing, ugly and accurate. I used to be blind. Saramago has captured the affliction well. The final quarter of the book is a disappointment after reading the first three quarters. All in all, it is very intriqueing book.
