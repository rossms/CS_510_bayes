I'm a Yankee fan, and I really don't like this team, but they really are one of the most up and coming teams in the league. They have arugably the best outfield in the MLB with Huff, Baldelli, and Crawford. Their infield is great, being led by Marlon Anderson. Their manager is, well, a legend. Their problem lies in their pitching. Zambrano is pretty good. In a few years, this might be the team to beat.
