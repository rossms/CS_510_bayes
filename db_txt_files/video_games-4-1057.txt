This is one of the few strategy games I enjoy. I usually try to honor agreements and hold to them, and I try not to be duplicitous about being an ally of someone. But when it comes to self-preservation, then unfortunately it becomes no-holds-barred for me. I never enjoyed being Italy; I always wanted to be the Russian Empire or Great Britain.
