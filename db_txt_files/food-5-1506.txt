I have to smile when I see old traditional candies like this are still on the shelf. They take me back to the age of 10 when we cashed in soda bottles at the grocery store and immediately ran to the connecting drugstore to spend the money (no holes have ever been burned in my pockets!). More times than not it would be on candy and much of the time one of my selections would be Sweet Tarts. I still buy a pack now and then because they're still the best sweet and sour combination in the world of candy.
