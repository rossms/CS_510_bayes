A serious strip is not such a bad idea in itself, but Mary Worth isn't even interesting! Trying to follow the long, boring plotlines is dreadful! I don't know why the cartoonist continues to put this out; there doesn't seem to be anyone who really enjoys it, and most people just skip over it as they read the comics anyway. I tried to follow it once, for a few months, but I got so sick of it that I vowed never to read it again, unless it was a choice between Mary Worth and Family Circus or Hi and Lois ...
