I got one for X-mas, and it's unbelievable. Awesome capacity - mine's 20GB - great sound, plenty of neat features, the list goes on and on. You synch not only songs, but also your address book. It's the perfect extension to iTunes. You can access your songs by playlist, genre, band - the search capacity is awesome, and it needs to be when you're dealing with so many songs. Highly recommended.
