I didn't even vote for the man. I voted for McGovern. But by ending the war in Vietnam, Mr. Nixon put the interests of young men like myself who had been drafted into the military ahead of the money interests who financed his campaign and wanted a profitable war to continue. A courageous decision in my book. Say what you like about Nixon's paranoia, but after thirty years I am still very grateful to Mr. Nixon for ending the Vietnam War.
