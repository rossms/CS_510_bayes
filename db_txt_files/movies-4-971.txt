Pretty damn scary when you're in grade school. I remember being terrified of almost any body of water after seeing this movie, including the public swimming pool. Even years later, swimming in the ocean, it was hard not to flash back to scenes of people being dragged underwater by a freakishly large Great White. I doubt that kids today, raised on special effects movies like The Matrix, will be very impressed with the mechanical shark, but in the 70s that thing was high-tech.
