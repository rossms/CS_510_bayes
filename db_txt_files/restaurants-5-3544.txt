Some of the best take-out pizza that I have ever tasted. Nice thin but tasty crust and lots of toppings. I usually like pizza with everything best but Donatos is so generous with their toppings it seems like it has everything when it may only have cheese a pepperoni. I have never seen a pizza with side to side pepperoni like theirs. Another nice touch I haven't seen elsewhere is the way they somehow to get the pepperoni kind of crispy on the edges. Mmmmmmm!
