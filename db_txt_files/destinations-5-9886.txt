PURE tobacco, PURE is the best word to describe it, no flavour added and taste just as natural as it can possibly get, although sometimes you have to relight it, somehow that makes you happy also because pure tobacco is not suppose to keep burning unless you've added certain chemical element like most mass produce cigarettes.
