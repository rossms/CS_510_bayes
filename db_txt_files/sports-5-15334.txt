The heart and soul of an entire franchise for more than a decade. Confidence, enthusiasm, toughness, and leadership define his game. Blessed with a tremendously strong arm, great accuracy, and a highly underrated release. Has become an outstanding decision maker on the football field and still has the knack to make big plays when the scheme breaks down. Unquestionably, the most durable qb of our time...oh, 3 consecutive league mvp's, a Super Bowl win and counting. One of the best ever. May go down as the best; give it some time.
