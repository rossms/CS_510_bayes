The only reason I didn't give Wal-Mart a 1 is because the stores seem to vary greatly in quality from state to state. Here in Denver, the Wal-Mart stores are like dumps. They are filthy and disorganized, and the lines go on forever. The most annoying part is that they never have what you need. Of course, it takes a long time to figure that out because there are no Wal-Mart employees on the floor to help you look for things. I think you could die in Wal-Mart and people would just roll their carts around you.
