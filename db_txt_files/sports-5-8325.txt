I'm embarassed to admit that I didn't know this guy existed until this year's play-offs. I had long ago considered San Antonio to be dull, but watched them this year to see if they could beat the Lakers. What an impressive player - he can do lots of things so well and is great fun to watch. He sounds intelligent during post-game interviews too, unlike some players out there.
