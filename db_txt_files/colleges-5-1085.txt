You either love this school, or you hate this school. It provides great academic opportunities and great social opportunities. If you can take advantage of one or both, you will love it here. If you can't take advantage of either, you will hate it. Obviously those that go here and hate it have few friends and are not doing well in class. Thats a VERY legit reason to hate a school. But I love it.
