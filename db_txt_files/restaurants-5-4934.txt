The orange freeze is magnificent. Table service can be scatterbrained or fantastic - we have more good experiences than bad. One night there was a crowd of drunks swearing in one corner and finally the manager spoke to them, but it took way too long to do something and the weasel kept trying to make the waitress do it. However, 9.95 times out of 10, it's worth the visit.
