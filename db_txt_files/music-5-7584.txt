The unusual outfits worn by the band is amusing. This is another Queen masterpiece. It really is a great song. I don't know whether or not it is really paying homage to radio, but it is great nonetheless. You made 'em laugh, you made 'em cry, you made us feel like we could fly, radio. All we hear is radio ga ga, radio goo goo, radio was new, radio, someone still loves you. If you haven't heard the song, I emphatically recommend it if you are a fan of Queen.
