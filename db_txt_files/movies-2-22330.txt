It's really dull for the most part. The only thing that I like about it is the portrayal of Luthor by Hackman, who went against type by playing Lex Luthor as more of a smarmy wiseass than a diabolical genius. Not the worst superhero flick, but not the best either. I heard Brando was paid for this in Twinkies.
