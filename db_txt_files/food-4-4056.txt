Cheez-Its are good, no doubt about it. They have a rich cheddar flavor, and they're nice and crunchy. I especially like the spicy Cheez-Its because they have a bit of a kick, and the white cheddar and reduced-fat versions are also tasty. Cheez-Its are great tossed into a bowl of tomato soup, and they make a pretty good snack. They don't have as much fat or as many calories as a lot of junk foods, so I don't feel bad about eating them. Overall, you can't go wrong with Cheez-Its.
