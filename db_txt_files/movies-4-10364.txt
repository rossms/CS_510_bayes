I loved this film - until the ending which in my opinion ruined the whole thing. The relationship between Sandler and Nicholson really worked, a very good dynamic there. But then to have the whole film boiled down to the girlfriend set the whole thing up so he'll kiss her in public and they get married??!!! Very poor....
