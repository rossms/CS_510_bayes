This is proof that Ford can build a good car, for all of you haters. Fold flat 3rd row, move together 2nd row buckets, and excellent reliability are the ups for this one. Power was increased a few years ago when Ford brought in the Taurus's great 3.0L DOHC, giving the van 200hp. Its smaller than most vans. If you need something like the Oddyssey, but not as large, get the MPV.
