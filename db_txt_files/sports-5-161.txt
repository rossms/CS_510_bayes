Vlad Guerrero is the best all around player in baseball and he is proving it now in Anaheim. He has the combination of both speed and power, hits for average and does not strike out. He's got a cannon of an arm and doesn't miss games...He is a carbon copy of the great Roberto Clemente but with power! A Perfect 5!!
