I am still surprised at how much I like this beer. My husband picked it out on a whim, and I said, Okay, but if it's terrible, it's all yours. I was scared because it is American, and I have had so many bad American beers. Not only is this delicious, it is also much more reasonably priced than the other (import) beers I drink. Yeungling Black & Tan is not sweet, not bitter, just dark, rich, savory and smooth. A definite repurchase.
