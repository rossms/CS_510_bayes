Right on the water, Lisbon is a very pretty city with a lot going on. One tip-When planning on where you are headed for your next stop, keep in mind that there are multiple train stations. I was looking to take a day trip to Sintra (there are many cool places which are only a short train ride away) and ended up at the wrong train station.
