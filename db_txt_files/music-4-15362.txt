Personally, I'm a huge fan of dance and techno, and anyone else who feels the same would love this CD. Yet, the lyrics aren't exactly perfect, and there's a ton of repetitiveness in many of the songs (like in Blue). Truth be told, though, Eiffel 65 isn't a one hit wonder. Their song, Move Your Body, went number one in seven countries, and another song on Europop, Too Much of Heaven, made it number one in their home country of Italy. So if you love dance techno music like Blue, you'll probably like a good portion of the album.
