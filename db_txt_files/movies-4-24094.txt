Lets face the facts...with all the new marvel comic movies that are out this one hasnt lived up to the expectations like others such as spiderman and xmen....but it is good. The CGI (computer animated imaging) is amazing and this makes the film worth watching. I am personaly getting a bit bored of the comic book hero films and this one isn't anything special from the recent buntch. Overall its enjoyable to watch and the fight sceens are extreamly well created so i rated highly for it...all fans of spider man should go see this film but if your not, then you should maybe give it a miss.
