LOL -- all you losers that are getting down on Starbucks are probably instant coffee drinkers. Starbucks -- and I have drunk a lot of coffee in my life -- is the best coffee out there -- hands-down. Especially their store-brand available at supermarkets. Keep drinking your Nescafe and Folgers while those of us who appreciate the finer things in life and don't nickel and dime everything enjoy our Starbucks. At their stores, it is made right, it is hot, and delicious -- and at home it is the best store-bought brand and worth every penny.
