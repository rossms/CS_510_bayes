I'm a long suffering Bears fan. 2001 was a miracle season, 2002 was a nightmare. Offensive coordinator John Shoop needs to be FIRED immediately; every time I watched the Bears this past year, Shoop would call a two yard pass play when it's 3rd and long. You simply can't win football games like that. The Bears need alot of work but they have alot of excellent young players on defense to build around. I really REALLY hope they don't go after Kordell Stewart; unfortunately they probably will since the Bears have the worst taste in free agents.
