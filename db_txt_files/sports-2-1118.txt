Not a good pitcher. Plays for the Yankees, which gives him a good winnig percentege because of run support. Has a good pickoff move because he is left handed and is looking right at the runner. Hanging curveball and a cut fastball that doesn't seem to save him from getting hit all over creation. Usually high ERA and gives up more hits than innings pitched. Very overrated.
