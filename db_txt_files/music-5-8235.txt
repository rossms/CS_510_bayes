Another excellent video, this time done by Stone Temple Pilots, which is an original song from the 60's, although I can't remember who sung it. It's basic, the group singing and playing their instruments. There is a 70's feel to it with the Brady Bunch squares and the flowers and hearts. The two monkeys dancing is a plus too!
