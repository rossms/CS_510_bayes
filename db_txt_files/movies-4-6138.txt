We watched it as a family last weekend and enjoyed it thoroughly. I've seen many many Draculas. Frank Langella and Gary Oldman give it the old college try. But Bela Lugosi IS Dracula. He just seems so damn out-of-this wordly. Watch Ed Wood and it simply proves Lugosi was as much out of his element in Hollywood as Vlad the Impaler would have been had he time-traveled to the 20th century. Legend has it, Lugosi was buried wearing his cape. While newer versions of the movie may be a bit more gruesome, the original stands as the best.
