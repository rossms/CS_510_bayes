I give Subway a perfect 5 out of 5. I love subway and eat there usually at least 2 to 3 times a week. My favorite sub is Southwest Steak and Cheese with lots and lots of southwest sauce, lettuce, tomatoes, salt and pepper, onions, oregano, paresan cheese, oil and vinegar, mayonnaise, and bannana peppers. Mmmm... want to go get one now!
