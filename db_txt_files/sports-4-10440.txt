He is the best coach all time. He is starting to lose his touch though. His team always plays with a lot of heart. Very classy. Needs to do something about the officials though. Penn St. keeps getting screwed. He competes with teams with a lot more talent. A GREAT COACH. I M AN LSU TIGER FAN BUT BECAUSE OF HIM PENN ST IS MY 2nd
