This is a great store... the produce is good quality at the best price around here and like the other said they also have name brand food and not just crap. By the way... the quarter for the carts is so not because the carts get stolen but it is so they don't have to pay someone to go out and collect all of the carts, and you get your quarter back anyway when you return the cart... That is the whole purpose.
