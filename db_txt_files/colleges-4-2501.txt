Loved the campus life. One of those schools where people have to party like crazy, because there is absolutely nothing in the world to do in Durham. Beautiful town, just beat. Academics are fine, nothing too crazy, I was a business major which is basically a bull sh degree no matter where you go. If you play baseball and join a frat you'll have a revolving bedroom door.
