Another restaurant with decent food but gives bad vibes with its hiring. Usually, only clean-cut, preppy white kids with a bad attitude work at these places. Can't they hire decent, normal people? Anyway, as these places all have the same food, so I'll just say it's decent. Clean up the hiring practices or I'll just eat at Famous Dave's, Denny's, the Texan or Chinese, or at one of many places that don't hire people like it's a club.
