Made the playoffs last year and probably would have despite the injuries the QB's have faced. The Eagles are a great team. Philly has lived in the shadows for too long, but much like the city, they're on the rise...Without injuries, look for the Eagles to be in the playoffs next season. E-A-G-L-E-S Eagles!!!!!
