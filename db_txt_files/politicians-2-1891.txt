Don't worry fellow Floridians. His term is soon ending and there's a list of candidates for his job next year. He keeps pushing for private school vouchers as if that's the solution to overcrowding in schools and making kids smarter. I think there will be a major reform of the FCAT testing system with the next governor. Many of you are right, the counties in South Florida have received more money, but that doesn't mean they support him;whereas the counties to the north support him and he ignores them. Go figure.
