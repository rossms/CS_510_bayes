Rustlers Rhapsody - 1985: Definitely a humorous play on the Old Time Westerns with some great actors. Tom Berrenger as the good guy played his roll well and the supporting cast fell into the character of this spoof on that era of film-making. G.W. Bailey added to the fun as he played Rex's sidekick adding to the humor. If you want some clean laughs then rent the Video, get some GOOD popcorn, and snicker the night away.
