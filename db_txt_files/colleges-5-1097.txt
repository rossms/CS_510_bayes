cornell is absolutely amazing. it's so petty when people who have never been to ithaca or been to the Lord's land that is the Cornell campus, put it down based on what they have heard. the fact that they can't think for themselves is the reason they don't come here, or maybe they go to harvard( i have taken classes at harvard as to not speak without personal experience--great grad schools, but dissapointing undergrad, but hey i'm not complaining it was a lot easier than cornell)
