I'll lay it out for you all like this..... Reeves as a FBI agent. Swayze as a dirt bag bank robber who leads a gang of bank robbers known as The Dead Presidents. He loves to surf, as does his cronnies and girlfriend, whom Reeves moves in on to get close to Swayze so as to catch him. Busey is Reeves' partner. Now you know the story. The movie is fun, not too serious, yet entertaining, regardless of all the negatives the film appears to have in it's cast. It is the type of movie you enjoy but never tell anyone you like.
