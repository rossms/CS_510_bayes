A darkly humourous films with many very funny moments particularly Ed Norton's characters's monologue about his sad IKEA lifestyle. It's not as violenmt as it's reputation and there are one or tow gross out bits e.g. when Norton and Pitt go salvaging for human body fat for Pitt's soap business. However, it's the ending that spoils it for me and loses one star. Too much of a wierd David Lynch type cop out for my liking.
