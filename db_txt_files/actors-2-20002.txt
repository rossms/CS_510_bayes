I love her in the American Pie movies, but I absolutely hated her character in Buffy. She was so dull and whiny all the time. And spare me with the big finale that one season where she was gonna destory the world, she was very unbelievable. Buffy went totally downhill as soon as UPN took over. It would probably still be on the air had the WB never sold it to them.
