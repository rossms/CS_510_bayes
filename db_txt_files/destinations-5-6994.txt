The greatest city in the world, the true Urbi et Orbi. This city is not only the capital of the British Empire, but the captial of the world. All the world pays it homage and tribute. There is no other place in the world that compares with it. I just wish they would do something about their transportation infrastructure, particuarly the decrepit overpriced tube!
