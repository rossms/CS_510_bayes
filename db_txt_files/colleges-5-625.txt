Wherever you decide to go to grad school, make sure that there is a faculty member who you want to work with and who wants to work with you. The right faculty can get you the right things. I have gotten funding repetedly for my research, and I have had a lot of support. It would not have been possible if I didn't have a faculty member interested in my work!
