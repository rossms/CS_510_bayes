Ho Chi Min city is lawless. . .look out for pickpockets. But Vietnam is cheap and friendly with decent Buddhist temples. If you can handle less-than-stellar hotels and washing your clothes in the sink, it is a cool place to visit for about a week. Food is underrated in Asian cuisine (sp.?) although Thai is better. Go to Vietnam if you happen to have a week to kill while visiting Asia.
