Starburst leave something to be desired. They have a strange texture to them that just feels weird in your mouth (and that's IF you can get them unwrapped in the first place--those little wrappers are hella annoying!). But anyway, they really don't taste that good, and they have an aftertaste. And the Starburst-flavored jelly beans are just disgusting.
