Heavily damaged during Hurricane Charley earlier this year, Fort Myers-Sanibel has been slowly recovering over the past few months. For a laid back vacation, this is the place to go in Florida. Very nice beaches, good weather. The area doesn't have the best nightlife, that's for sure, but these are some of the best beaches in the state. By next summer, they should be ready full blast.
