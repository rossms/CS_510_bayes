His personal life aside, Bill Clinton is very probably the consumate politician and campaigner. If there is a question about anything other than his personal life, I trust President Clinton as much, perhaps more, than any other politician. I doubt there will be a smarter, perhaps sometimes naive, President in the 21st century. There wasn't in the 20th century.
