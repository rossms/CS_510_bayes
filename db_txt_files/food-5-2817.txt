This soup is great. There is a great variety and many are even low calorie and fat so you can stick to your diet. Even the low calorie ones are full of flavor and loaded with tasty meat and veggies. The sodium is high just like with most soups, but id recommend this brand. Try the cheese-tortillini for a low cal treat.
