Can anyone tell me which one has been around longer: Coke or Pepsi? I really love Coke ,and its got a flaver like no other.I have to agree that Pepsi is an over-rated waster of aluminum. I really have never liked Pepsi and their advertising does , indeed, stink. I will always and forever support Coka-cola and I advise yoy to.
