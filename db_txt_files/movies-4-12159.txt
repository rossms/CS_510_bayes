An above average comedy movie starring SNL Alumnus Dana Carvey and Star Trek: The Next Generation's Brent Spiner is a recommended movie for families. Celebrity cameos are delievered in a clever way, some politicians are spoofed and there are some quality gags, and even the gas gag was well executed, which is very rare. Look for a very cool credits sequence also!
