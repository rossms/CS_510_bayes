I received an excellent education at the GSB - especially in finance, options and accounting. I've used these skills extensively in my investment banking career. The professors are very smart, earnest and hard working. My only complaint is that I found (most of) the student body to be very competitive, and the forced grade curve didn't help. After reading a review below, it sounds like the GSB no longer discloses grades to recruiters. This is a great development and hopefully will lead to more cohesive, supportive and team-work focused students.
