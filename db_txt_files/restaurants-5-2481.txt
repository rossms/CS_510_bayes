Church's chicken is the absolute BEST fast-food chicken! It's crispy, tasty, not overloaded with pepper in the batter; tastes like homemade. I don't know where the deja... person went, but I have been to Church's franchises in several states and have always been treated very well (quick, caring service). The prices are good, the side orders are really good, and the honey biscuits are great! The only reason KFC outrates Church's has to be that people haven't tried Church's chicken!
