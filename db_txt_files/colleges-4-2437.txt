Ithaca is a great school, academically. A lot of really great people go there. The buildings are mostly pretty ugly, but the setting, geographically, is beautiful. The makeup of the college ismostly white, and upper class, which can be bothersome to those seekign a more multicultural experience. Regardless, Ithaca is a pretty great place to be.
