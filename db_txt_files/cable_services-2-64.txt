From my experience with Comcast, I believe they are committing fraud; they offer you a special with no specific time limit and once you agree to take advantage of the special they tell you after you've had the service for several months that it was promotional and the promotion is over so you're now required to pay a signifacant increase for your service to remain the same. Sounds like bait & switch to me.
