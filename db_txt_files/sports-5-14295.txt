Simply the best ever. He made everyone else around him better. 47 straight games with a TD pass. He invented the 2-minute drill and the west coast offense. Called all his own plays. Was probably the toughest QB to ever play...always played hurt. He held all the passing records until they changed the rules to protect the QB and eliminate holding on WRs. But he still holds a few. Elway, Marino and Montana are great, but they wouldn't have come close to Unitas had they played under the same set of rules.
