Celebrate diversity, just eat at a Wafflehouse after 1AM. Truckers, transvestites, travelers, homeless people, students, and imagine this; everybody seems to get along, well at least MOST of the time. And oh yeah, ask for your hashbrowns scattered, covered and smothered, you'll be glad you did...all in all a decent late night eatery, though they lose a star for a slightly overpriced menu.
