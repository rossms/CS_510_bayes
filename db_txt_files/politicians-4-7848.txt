Did little to slow down the ineffective New Deal programs of FDR and, overall, he was fairly weak when it came to domestic issues. However, his dealings with the Soviets and Chinese at the beginning of the Cold War were extraordinary in vision and scope. Every Cold War president that followed Truman owed him a debt. And he was decisive which was best illustrated by his decision to drop atomic bombs on Japan thus ending WWII. Truman was a better president than both FDR (his predecessor) and Eisenhower (his successor).
