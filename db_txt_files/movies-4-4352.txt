The first time I saw it I thought it was really good. The second time I saw it, I thought it was still good, but not as good as the first time. Of course, both times I did have REALLY annoying little children who sat behind me and my friend and would laugh at ANYTHING(or at least that's how it seemed). I would recomend seeing it, but I wouldn't resomend seeing it over, and over, and over again if you don't have to.
