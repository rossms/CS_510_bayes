Bob Evans is pretty good if you are looking for an affordable restaurant for the family. When my kids were small they had one of the better children's menu I have seen. they serve breakfast all day. At lunch time they have menu with reduced prices. they food itself is pretty good. They offer some homestyle type meals, Of course this is not one of your fine dining restaurants but the food is pretty decent and for a family on a budget it is a fairly good deal.they also offer a good variety of meals to choose from.
