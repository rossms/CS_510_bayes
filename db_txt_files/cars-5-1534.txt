Very Powerful Engine, with good torque. Gas miliage is 30 to 32 around town, and 37 on the highway (65 to 70mph). Great handling potential with better tires (the standard Firestone Affinity tires are terrible). I had the dealer put the SC2 tires/wheels combo (Firestone GTAs) on the car and it was much better. Squeeks and Rattles, and Brakes that warp in 14k miles are the only downsides to the car.
