Camel filters are the best! though recently they have changed to German manufacture (at least in Australia anyway) and now they taste like crap! I've tried just about every other brand avialable but none could compare to the good old made in USA Camel Filters, I missed them so much I might just have to give up :( To those tree hugging hippies: go and munch on your tofu salads and piss off!!!
