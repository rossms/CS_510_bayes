I support Bill Bradley 100%. He stands for the working people of the United States, and he is honest and fair. More politicians should look at him and learn from his example. I really blows my mind how people can vote for G.Dubya Bush for President, and not Bill Bradley. It makes you wonder why these morons are walking around free!
