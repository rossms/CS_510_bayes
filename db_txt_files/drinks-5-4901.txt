RC Cola is the Best. Coke is okay in a cold can, and Pepsi is the only decent fountain cola. But if it comes down to an ice cold Cola, or a fountain(if you can find RC tap), or from a glass bottle; RC is by far the best. And you've had Coke and Pepsi Slushies; but if you ever have oppurtunity to have an RC that way(can in freezer for hour), you'll never look back. If you opinion is based on an RC bottled in plastic, your opinion doesn't count. We all know that plastic destroys COLA and ROOTBEER.
