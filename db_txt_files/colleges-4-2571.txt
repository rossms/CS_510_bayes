If you're looking to get away from the city life for 4 years but you still want your school to have a heartbeat, you should consider UVM. The campus is large and very attractive. Greek life is fairly big, and the campus is right in the middle of Burlington so there are many bars closeby. It's also less than a half mile from the water which gives it a serene feel. And if you're under 21, Canada is a half hour away.
