Finally managed to dine at a Cheesecake factory and it was very good. The menu is a book with advertising in it, that is how big it is. If you can't find any thing you like on the menu well you have bigger problems. The place was very clean and the service was excellent. Lots of good food and the cheesecake is out of this world. Price were good and a great value for what you got. As mention the cheesecake is very good but it is not cheap.
