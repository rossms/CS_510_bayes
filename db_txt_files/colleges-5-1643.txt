Tulane was a fantastic experience! New Orleans is a beautiful city and the campus is in the nicest part of town. Classes are small, professors are friendly and encourage you to visit them during office hours. The student body is from all 50 states and quite a few other nations. Overall excellence is to be expected from Tulane!
