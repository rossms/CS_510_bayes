Once you get used to the taste you really learn to love it. It gives me more energy, clarity, and relief from morning blah's when I havn't had enough sleep - way better than coffee and you only need one can. It always gives me a boost when I need it. However, it is sometimes hard to find in the stores. Everyone I have introduced it to when they had the need for a pick up found it to be excellent and buy only it out of all the energy drinks as it seems to have the right mixure of ingredients to make you feel better.
