Denver is still my favorite city in all of America. No other city in the United States is more beautiful than this one. Denver has one of the most superb skylines, one of the best football teams (even though not my favorite), some of the greatest restaraunts in the world, a gorgeous, clean downtown, down-to-earth people, and just so many wonderful things ! Not too far away is some of the best skiing in the world. I honestly and truly can say that Denver is possibly the best city in the world. The day I move away from Orlando, Florida is the day I move to Denver, Colorado.
