Although David Selznick's constant interferrance didn't help allow Hitchcock to make the film they way he wanted it, REBECCA is certainly a good film. Good enough , it seems, for the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences to call it the best picture of 1940. Olivier, Fontaine and Anderson give great performances in this, one of the more commercially suspenseful films of Hitchcock's career.
