This stuff keeps me alive all night if I have enough of them mixed with Vodka. Occassionally use them as a pick me up in the day time too. But personal preference would be, with a double measure of Vodka and some ice. However, one wiff of this stuff the morning after a night out....EW! makes me feel queasy. You love or you hate it, there's no in between.
