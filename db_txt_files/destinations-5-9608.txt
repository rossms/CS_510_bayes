djarum blacks are pretty damn amazing. yes, they are bad for you, and they are worse than many other cigarettes. to me, djarum blacks are my depression cigarette. They don't exactly make you feel... happy, however, they make you feel calm and stable. I smoke Kool Milds, but every once and awhile throw in a few Djarums such as Vanilla's, Cherries, Bali Hi's, and Specials. Well all in all, my first cigarette was a djarum black, and I didn't find it too strong to be honest.
