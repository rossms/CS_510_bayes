If I remember correctly this was one of those whisky's that you would inevitably find at some high school party. A.) it was cheap and B.) someone was able to swipe it from their parents liquor cabinet not amazingly unnoticed considering the parents hadn't touched the stuff in years. Harsh, sour, get drunk kinda whisky.
