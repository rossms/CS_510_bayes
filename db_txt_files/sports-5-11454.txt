I think he is the best coach for the University of Florida. His game planning is unbelievable. His ability to make adjustments is crucial to UF's suCcEsS. He has great ethics in recruiting and discipline. I think he is a genius, as was Coach Superior. I hope he remains the Head Ball Coach at UF forever.
