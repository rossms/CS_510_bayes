I am a believer in the Cracker Barrel philosophy. Create a relentlessly down home restaurant, force your patrons to walk through a sweet smelling store with all kinds of quaint tasty things to buy on the way in or out, and line up rocking chairs on the front porch. I would live in a Cracker Barrel if I could.
