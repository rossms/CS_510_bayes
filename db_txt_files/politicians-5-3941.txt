This might be 1-star more than he deserves, but I have to counter the radical lefties on this site. But then again, I've seen the 2 1/2 stars given to Janet Reno, so most of the people rating these politicians obviously don't have a clue... GWB has a vision, good leadership and people skills and he has surrounded himself with good people. He'll be a much better president than his father -- and that will make him light-years better than Clinton or Gore.
