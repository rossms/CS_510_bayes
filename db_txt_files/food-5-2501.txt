Why is it called Butterfinger? What really is a Butterfinger? These were questions I asked before I tasted one. I didn't want to try it because of the yellow packaging, the name and what it looked like (an orange inside?) Well, now that I have actually had one, it is one of my favorites. It is this flaky, inside that is hard to describe. It is sweet, kind of peanut buttery, and what really gets me is the texture of it. It is definately worth trying and it doesnt' really matter what it is made of if it tastes good, right?
