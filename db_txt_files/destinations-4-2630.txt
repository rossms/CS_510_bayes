One can tour Afghanistan now with a group; it's relatively safe. Most Afghans, especially in Kabul, will be openly friendly to Americans. The culture is well-known to be the most hospitable in the world to guests of all kinds. The remnants of the Taliban are largely confined to remote mountains in the East, and don't pose much of a threat to tourists. (Don't veer off any main road too far, however, as exploding mines still tend to be a problem.)
