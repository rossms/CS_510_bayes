UPDATED: Whether you like him or not he is still our President. I've probably said this before but I encourage everyone to pray for this man. I personally like Bush and in saying this I know he has made mistakes. He is a strong leader and that is what our country needs. The other choices were not very good in speaking of Gore and then Kerry. No matter how upset you are he got elected, they did not, so lets move on and unite as a country.
