The Dolphins arent too bad, but they definitely did have a bad year. I think that the loss of Ricky Williams really changed this ball club around a little. The Dolphins hold many records though. They are the only team to be undefeated and win a superbowl in the same year. They had the quarterback that used to hold the most single season touchdown record, which was Dan Marino. I'm sure that the Dolphins will have a better season next year.
