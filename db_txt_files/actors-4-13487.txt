Saw her in Bound, which was an excellent film. Other than that she has had either small supportng roles, or been in truly weak and inconsequential flicks.... including a couple that were laughable messes and a couple that were disgusting in concept. Question: was Bound the one right role for her, or are we missing a good talent because she is a captive of bad flicks. Maybe time will tell, but she needs to find another good movie or she will be forever seen lurking around in the 5-nights for 99 cents section of video stores.
