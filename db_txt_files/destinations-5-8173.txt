Fantastic sites from every viewing spot (try the east side where no one goes), cool weather due to the elevation (even in the middle of summer) and the small town outside the entrance has reasonable motels for the night and the best Mcdonalds I've eaten in in 20+ years (makes you remember why they got so popular in the first place).
