I have had MetroPCS for over a year and think it is great! Sure, I drop calls every now and then but what company doesn't? I had the Sony first and it was below average; the new phones are great! (I have the Nokia camera phone). They also have a cool plan that has everything included for only $45 - text, picture messages, voice mail, all that stuff. You do need to check to make sure you have coverage first because it doesn't work everywhere.
