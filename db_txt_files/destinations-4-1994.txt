Okay, I feel horrible about what happened to buttebulldog's friend but that could easily just as happen in the projects of nyc or la. If a crime made a country so horrible then every country would get one star because no country is perfect. South Africa is probably one of the most visually stunning countries in the world w/lots of wonderful people.
