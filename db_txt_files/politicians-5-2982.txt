Enough with the insults, Ventura is a great guy. It's funny that most of the people here insulting him probably have never lived in Minnesota. I've lived there my whole life. And Ventura is one of a rare type of politician: one who speaks their mind and isn't beholden to others. Too bad he is retiring soon.
