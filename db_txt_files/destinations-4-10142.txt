No ciggerette is great but I'm enjoying a nice Marlboro Red right now. Sure, all smokes are bad for you( you light smokers out there can quit fooling youselves), but to me smoking is a luxurey so if your going to smoke you may as well enjoy what you like. Marlboro is the only nice smooth smoke that doesn't make your throat scratchy While you're smoking it.
