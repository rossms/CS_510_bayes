The Talented Mr. Ripley was not what I expected. The acting was good. The setting was beautiful but the story not only dragged but was just weird. It didn't sit well with me. There were a lot of undertones that led you to believe Matt Damon's character was gay which was a weird twist in the plot. I was confused at what Matt Damon's characters goal was. It was misleading, and weird. The only part I liked was the footage of Europe.
