The single greatest franchise in the history of sports...........and I'm from Boston and I can admit that. I get embarressed when Sox fans say the Yankees suck, because bottom line is they don't and never have. Big payrolls can't buy heart and I disagree that they don't have any. They are resilient and will do anything to win during a game.
