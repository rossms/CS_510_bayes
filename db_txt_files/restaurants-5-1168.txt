What negatives can you say about DD? Their donuts are legendary, and they offer Baskin Robbins ice cream, which is phenomenal tasting stuff for mass produced ice cream. And most importantly, DD's coffee is FANTASTIC! It actually is smoother and better tasting than expensive places like Starbuck's or Caribou Coffee. Whatever coffee DD executives use in all their stores, PLEASE DON'T CHANGE! Long live Dunkin' Donuts!!!
