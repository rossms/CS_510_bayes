A friend of mine recently shared two different tequillas with me which he brought back from Mexico. The first was touted by his father-in-law as the best . When I tasted it, I had to agree. It was the best tequilla I'd ever tasted. Then he shared the Don Julio Anejo with me. Quite honestly, if someone offered me a shot of the other tequilla, I'd throw rocks at them. Don Julio is absolutely the best.
