I find this movie a tad bit scary.. not tremendously so, but just enough to be fun. Sometimes its kind of ridiculous at times, which is at the point my kids and I turn into a mst3000 bunch, and mock it a bit.Always thought I'd grow out of this movie, eventually but always seem to be drawn to it everytime it's shown on tv. Also enjoy the sequels, which is a rare thing for me.
