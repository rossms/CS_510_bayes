This is a tough one. Bruce Willis is not that great of an actor. He is very good looking and he is fun to watch. But he plays the same kind of person over and over again and it appears that he has a hard time to show real emmotions sometimes. But he was in so many good movies that he deserves at least 4 stars. We all watched Die Hard, Armageddon, The Sixth Sense etc.
