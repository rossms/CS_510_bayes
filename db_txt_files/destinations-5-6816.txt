Probably travel to Oklahoma more than any other state. Mainly because most of my family lives there. It is a beautiful state. Farms lands, the plains in the south. The rolling hills and forest in the northeast. And a little fact, World's Largest McDonald's is north of Tulsa on I-44. Also, defintly check out the Oklahoma City Bombing Memorial. It is really well done. One of the things I like about it is that they have chairs with the names of every person who died in the bombing.
