Heres the deal, this car saved my life. I got into a *very* bad accident with it (100% not my fault, thank you) at 75 mph where i was hit three times. I walked away without a scratch. Other than that, I loved the car. Rode great, no matinence needed. I would buy another one in a heartbeat. Go Avalanche!
