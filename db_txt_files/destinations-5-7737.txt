You can not only see a beautiful view of the river or lake or whatever that body of water is out there, but you can grab a bite to eat and shop around Harvard Square. It is extremly hard to get parking, but most people walk there anyways, so join in on the fun, and if you're willing to eat a 2 pound tuna sandwich that you WILL enjoy, youn will love Harvard Square.
