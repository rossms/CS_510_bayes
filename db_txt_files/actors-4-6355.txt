He started off with a bang in the early seventies and even made the cover of Time. He was in M*A*S*H and that was his big early role. He even got divorced from Barbra Streisand and things were looking up. Then he became involved in a long series of turkeys in the mid to late 1970's and his career went into the tank. He has made a comeback, however, and he co-starred in "Ocean's Eleven" and "Ocean's Twelve," recently. A hidden treasure if you can find it is "The Silent Partner" (1968) with Christopher Plummer, Susannah York and even a young John Candy.
