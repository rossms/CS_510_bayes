Without a doubt, the best pre-packaged tea on the planet.... bar none. I totally love this stuff. I buy the big gallon jugs and they don't last a week. The only thing that helped me kick the Diet Coke habit. Not too sweet, not thick or syrupy, and just enough of the honey flavor to give it a mild taste.
