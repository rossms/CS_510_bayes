Keanu Reeves plays the good cop with one facial expression, tracking down a mad bomber with a thing for revenge. Violence abounds, and good special effects, but improbable events bring the quality down. Very suspensful climax. Riveting, though not good enough to pay money for. Catch it on network TV.
