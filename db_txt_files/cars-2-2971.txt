My brother has a Mitsubishi Eclipse 92', and I have to admit that this car has given my brother and me headaches all the time. We took this car to the mechanic and after two months of being parked on my garage, we finally got the car running. Also, just to check the car's computer (which most likely you have to check every time is in the shop) it will cost you some good $$$. Even to replace the Mitsubishi parts it's expensive because the car is imported. On a second note, it's gives you good mileage. The worst of all.... I think that I will eventually inherit my brother's car. What a dilemma!!!
