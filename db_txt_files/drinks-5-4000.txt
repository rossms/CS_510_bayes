First discovered in San Juan on cruise ship trips. Now discovered they sell it in Tijuana (Mexico BC) right at the Arch at North End of Revolution Avenue. I bring back a fifth on each Mexico visit, because this rum is smoooooth and wonderful. Yes, drink it straight, or on rocks, or with coke. It's the best.
