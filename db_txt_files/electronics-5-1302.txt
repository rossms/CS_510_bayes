I've owned two Nomads. The first Nomad I had problems with and returned it for a second one. It wouldn't connect to the computer. The second one worked fine, but when the Nomad II came out, I had to have it. It's sleek, comes with a radio, voice recorder, and has a docking station. The best MP3 player out there.
