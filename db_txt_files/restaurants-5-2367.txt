Great service, clean facility and awesome food. Some would argure if this is actually Fast Food. You order, get a number, sit down then wait for the food to be served (it also has a drive thru). The one I ate at was a bit crowded and was taking a lot of people away from the McDonalds that is across the street. A bit more expensive than McDonals but its worth every penny. The one I ate at even had a firplace with a fire going! I will be eating here again.
