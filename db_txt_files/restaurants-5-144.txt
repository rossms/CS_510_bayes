People sure like to rag on Starbucks, don't they? They McDonalds of coffee houses (you know your cup is the same from store to store.) You know what? GREAT! I LOVE being able to get a cup of coffee that I know I will enjoy; and if I don't, they'll give me a refund. As a devoted coffee addict (I used to dip coffee during the morning run in boot camp), I think I am a pretty good judge of the bean. Starbucks does a bang-up job of selecting, storing, and preparing all of their fine coffee drinks. Enjoy!
