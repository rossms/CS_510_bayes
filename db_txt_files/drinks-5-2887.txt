I really like this energy drink. I like it because it comes in a smaller portion than other energy drinks, I can just drink it fast and be done with it. Also, there's no crash like there is with other drinks. 5 Hour Energy Drink had a very consistent, comfortable energy level. I didn't feel shaky or that "over-caffeinated" at all.
