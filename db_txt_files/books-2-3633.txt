It's been said that 1984 failed as a prophecy because it succeeded as a warning. For a novel, it certainly did have an influence on society. To this day, people still use the expression Big Brother to refer to intrusive government. But as good as the message was, the novel itself was dull and the characters were tiresome. It seemed that the book would never come to an end.
