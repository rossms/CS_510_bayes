A really beautiful state - I'm surprised it isn't located higher on this list. It has all the beauty of California, but none of the crowds. One of the most stunning national parks, Crater Lake, is here. Portland is a beautiful city. The oceanfront is nice, with waves crashing on the rocks. The air is clean and the rain makes everything green. This is a gorgeous state to visit.
