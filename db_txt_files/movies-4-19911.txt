i thought the movie was pretty good. it could have ben better though. after the 2nd time watching it i then understood how all 3 sorda just made sence and came together. i dont know why, but for some reason i dont think the actors acted really good. neve cambell, dewey, and courtney did a great job though...as usualy. i dont think the killings were good either.the 1st one will always be the best. the killings in the 1st one were awesome. each movie just gets worse but the storys all come together for one big awesome story!
