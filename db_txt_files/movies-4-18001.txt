One of the very best in the mid'70's as this was not better than Halloween, but very close in those days. Scary and creepy as this girl in the first place was messed up by her mom. Despite that you have to wait 'til the end for gasps and screams, you will have to feel some sympathy for her despite that she is so crazy when she is provoked. It will teach some parents to be better after watching this.
