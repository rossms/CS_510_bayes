John Grisham returns to his roots. He leaves the sone of trying to tell nice stories and goes back to the legal thriller genre. Reuben Atlee is a backwoods Mississippi judge. He summonses his two sons, Ray and Forrest, to his chambers . They arrive - he's dead. Ray learns there's something fishy in his past. Not as fast-paced as The Pelican Brief or The Client or The Firm, but entertaining, nonetheless.
