Great game, the reason I bought an xbox, and I wasnt disappointed. The flood are one of the most annoying enemies you will ever encounter on a game like this. Played for 2 days solid and beat the game on every difficulty. Im not a nerd, just shows you how good the game must have been for me to do that
