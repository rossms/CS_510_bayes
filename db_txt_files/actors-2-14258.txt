I get her and Meg Ryan confused. Are they both necessary? Seems to me one of them is more than enough. With so many talented people that never get a shot, how is it these blond airheads keep rising to the top? Ridiculous. I guess if you're blond and have connections that can overcome any lack of talent in Hollywood.
