Good coach doing a good job at a good school to build up. RR's system works well for WVU and his success should be good enough to build off of for years to come. The weakened Big East is ripe for the picking by an up-and-coming team and RR is in a primo spot to take advantage of that. Team was overrated this year and true test will come when Louisville joins Big East.
