While this film is fun to watch,and has probably one of the BEST soundtracks ever,its message is muddled at best.Wonderful acting through and through-with a very young Jack Nicholson stealing his scenes with panache.A must see for chopper enthusiasts! This film preserves American Roadscapes well before every Highway looked alike with the same ugly chains and strip malls robbing localities of their uniqueness and individuality.
