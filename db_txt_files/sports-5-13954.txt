You will not find a guy with better moves then Barry. He pulled more Safety's groins then you can shake a stick at. Just getting a finger on him was a defensive backs worst nightmare. He had NO OFFENSIVE LINE and was still averaging over 5 yards a carry. Had of he still played he would of SLAUGHTERED all major rushing records.
