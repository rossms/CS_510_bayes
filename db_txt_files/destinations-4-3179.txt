Such friendly,hospitable people.Excellent accommodation,delicious food.Clean,modern,culturally diverse,in an attractive lakeside setting.Superb shopping at the marvellous Eaton Centre.The Art Gallery of Ontario,including work by the country's own Group of Seven, is a pleasure.And of course there's the C.N.Tower,and Niagara just round the corner.Warm memories, and definitely recommended.
