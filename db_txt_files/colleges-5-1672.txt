As a student at Notre Dame I can tell you it is all that it is cracked up to be. Yes, some of the alumni are a bit too proud and yes football is a big deal but this place is amazing. The education is top-notch and it is great because it is like a small liberal arts college during the week and a huge Big 10 school on weekends. It really can't be beat, look at the admissions statistics! It is hard as hell to get into this place!
