The decadent behaviour of Babe Ruth knew no bounds. He was a drinker a womanizer and hell on wheels in a bar brawl! Hit at least 50 HR in 4 different seasons. Quite a feat when you consider the dead ball era, the 54ft distance from pitcher mound to home plate (as opposed to 60ft 6in for todays game), and lest we not forget what must have been some hellacious hangovers. Overcame adversaries by shear will. Definetely worthy of his larger than life stature.
