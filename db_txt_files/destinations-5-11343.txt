I started making the 4 hour drive to Tunica back when it was just a couple of casinos in the middle of nowhere. Had to stay in Memphis because there weren't enough rooms, but still had a great time. Now its like a mini-Vegas, even has stuff for the kids to do, though I don't recommend arriving expecting 24 hr entertainment for the kids while you ignore them gambling. That's just sad. Vegas is too far to visit often, but Tunica is a perfect weekend getaway (or midweek, for that matter!)
