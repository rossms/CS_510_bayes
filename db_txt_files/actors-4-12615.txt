I wouldn't go so far as to say that she is the greatest woman who has ever lived as Ducktales seems to believe but she's pretty good. Easy on the eyes and all... as for her acting ability I'm going to give her a double shoulder shrug, I guess she okay. Considering Paul is her father she got pretty lucky I think, I mean he's a pretty hefty guy she apparently didn't get those genes.
