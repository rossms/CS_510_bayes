I was actually surprised at how good this movie is (I'm not a big Jodie Foster fan). The direction is taut and stylish--similar to David Fincher's Seven, but it doesn't go overboard on the gory details. Dwight Yoakem plays a terrific guy you love to hate character--up there with his stint in Sling Blade. Forrest Whitaker was good too as a sympathetic bad guy.
