After thinking budweiser was all there was out there i decided later to expand my tastebuds and they have worshipped me for it ever since. There are so many beautiful tasting beers to drink out there. budd is really nothing more than cheap tasting dish water compared, but its so mass produced it's like the coca cola of beers. I recomend you get out there and order a 4 pack of something other than budd and listen to your taste buds scream with delight.
