Last year was my senior ball and my boyfriend's senior ball. We had rented a huge party bus for after the dance and it was stocked with lots of liquor, but that night there were three bottles of Malibu and it was the first time I ever tried it. I liked it so much that after awhile it just tasted like coconuts with no liquor after taste.
