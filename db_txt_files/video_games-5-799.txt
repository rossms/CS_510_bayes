This is the best game ever invented. It's a board game you can play again and again and never get tired of it. It's always a new game with different players. You can form teams, make allies, and mess people up by not showing them the correct card. Also, the older you get, the better you are at playing the game. For example, instead of marking X's in the column, you mark what person gave you that card, so as the game goes on you can konw other people's cards without getting it shown to you. Some may say that's cheating, I say it's a good game plan.
