Set in an amazing location, on a steep mountain slope surrounded by 5 peaks over 20,000 feet. Culturally fascinating -- Bolivia has the largest number of indigenous people of any South American country. The better hotels have oxygen available in the lobbies, it's so high up. Like most Latin capitals, it's dirty, but it's well worth visiting.
