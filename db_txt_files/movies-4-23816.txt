Very good over the top satire of the Topps Company alien invasion cards. The story is, that Tim Burton wanted to produce a very serious SciFi film, but couldn't get funding because Independence Day had just come out. I heard he reworked the script and signed numerous stars and he got the funding. Very good large ensemble cast. Very early role for Jack Black.
