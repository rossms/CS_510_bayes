Her acting needs to be sharpen. I saw two of her movies, which the titles I forgot.. I think one is about her and a gay man, and I completely forgot the other one. I think she was just not into the characters. She can't make the characters live. She did OK with her role in Friends, but, personally, I got bored with her acting. It's just so superficial. She can make herself better if she wants to.
