This is tremendous effort by a first time author. The Beach is a well-written, interesting novel with likeable, believable and flawed characters. Garland's descriptions paint a beautiful picture and the predominance of dialogue make this a quick and easy read. Even though I'm a guy who would usually prefer to watch a Real World episode for the fourth time rather than read a book, I really enjoyed this one.
