This video I don't think does this song justice. Yes it is slick but it seems to have no aim, no real objective. Why are they in the club. Why do they wander around in slow motion. This video just drags. It looks nice for what it is and then it leaves us hanging. What happens next? Snoop and his posse walk up the stairs in slow motion? It could have been much better.
