Clint does it again with a terrific mystery wrapped inside an enigma, etc. etc. He's a Dirty Harry-clone tracking down a killer who appears to be going after specific people and to top it all off, he's getting it on with the sister of a victim whose heart was quite literally given to our hero. Suspenseful and imaginitive, Blood Work is easily one of the best films of 2002.
