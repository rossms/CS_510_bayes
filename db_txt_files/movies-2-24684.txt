Wow, this is just a bad movie. I have to confess that I rented it, in large part, just to see the bit part by Rhona Mitra, a stunningly beautiful actress whose name you probably won't recognize (she was on the TV show Party of Five for awhile, and that's where I saw her). Anyway, since I'd heard the movie stunk, I didn't expect too much, so I wasn't upset when the movie turned out to be uninspired, predictable, and essentially devoid of the suspense you'd expect from a so-called thriller. I'm giving the movie two stars, though, because the special effects are pretty well done.
