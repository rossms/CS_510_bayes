I don't know why, but I didn't care for As Good As It Gets. The romance was too corny and there was no chemistry between the 2 of them. The ending was extremly mindless with them staring at the bricks, and Greg Kinnear was extremly annoying. The only reason why you may want to catch any of this is to see Helen Hunt with curly hair.
