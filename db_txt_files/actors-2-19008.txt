Whether I think he deserved an Oscar for his documentary or not, Michael Moore should have kept his opinions to himself. The Academy Awards were no place to air his feelings in politics and war. Other celebrites who are known for being outspoken restrained themselves.Besides i felt sorry for all of the other people he dragged up on stage and then started in with his protests. I wonder how they felt?By the way some of the audience reacted, they did not like his speech either.Too bad he did not show more class like Adrien Brody did, just saying he wished for peace not matter what the beliefs were.
