A personal favourite... even when compared to my experiences with vintage Dom '90 and '96, it remains, inconsequentially, the less-pricey victor over my palatte. With respect to recommending it to others, I would put it on the same level as Dom, and in the case of the Grande Dame variety, slightly higher... reason being its more robust flavour.
