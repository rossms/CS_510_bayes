I just returned from my second missions trip to the Philippines and once again, had a heavenly time. I have still yet to meet one unfriendly filipino, the people there are so amazing, hospitable, and thankful. Almost every person I talked to is so thankful for America and their part in liberating them from the Japanese, but above all they said, they are so thankful for America bringing them Jesus. They said the Lord has made all the difference in their country. Please pray for the filipinos, the filipino pastors, and the country. God bless the Philippines!
