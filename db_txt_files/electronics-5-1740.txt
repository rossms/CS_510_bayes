I've always trusted Mistubishi products and their VCR's are the best. I've had a really old VCR made by Mitsubishi and it still works great so I bought a new one. This new one has great fast forwarding and playing value. When recording and playback, the quality stays original even after multiple replays, unlike Sony, which the picture quality was significantly poorer after three months.
