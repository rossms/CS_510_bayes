I have been a Subway eater, yet I have had better subs other places. I will give them credit for their variety, yet real cheese tastes a hell of alot better than the processed cheese that Subway puts on their sandwiches. And the bread is not fresh which doesn't make them the best. I like them still but they are not top choice in the sub sandwiches department.
