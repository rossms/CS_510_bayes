These are my main brand. I always said I'd never smoke Marlboro's cause everyone else does, but once I started smoking Marlboro Light 100's, nothing else taste the same. They are in my opinion the best. They aren't a harsh inhale, yet they are strong enough to satisfy the craving. I used to smoke full flavor and lights always tasted airy, but now that I am used to lights full flavors are too strong. I can see why so many people smoke these!
