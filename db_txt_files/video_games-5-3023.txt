The best,most realistic, racing game ever made. With the option of buying over 20 different brands of cars, modifying them, and winning some Formula cars; the game can be fun forlong time. I've spent hours on this game just to get enough credits for a better car. The physics of the racing make thegame better then any otherracing gameI've played and the real companies (e.g. Honda, Toyota, Dodge, TVR.....) make the game that much more interesting....buy your dream car. This game is also 20 bucks and deffinetly one of the best greatest hits games.
