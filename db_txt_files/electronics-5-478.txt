This really changed my opinion on Minidisc players, it sounds great, lookd great, and shows up Sony's beaming reputation. A real cracker, this, really recommended. It's also very small, compact, and stylish. I'd also recommend Sony's Minidisc Island site, use this link http://exclusive.proteinmusic.com/debut2064666/md.htm
