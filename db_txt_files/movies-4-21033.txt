It was a work of art. The metaphorical invisionment on what society does to people. Pink was trying to cope with the memories of his child hood that made him what he was, and what he did wasn't good enough for society. So, he became what The Worm wanted, and then he was ridiculed and judged... for being human. That we should allow society's thoughts and feelings have an affect on us, and by doing that they wanted to Tear Down The Wall ! I don't think that people should just watch this movie, they should concentrate on the message and think about it as well.
