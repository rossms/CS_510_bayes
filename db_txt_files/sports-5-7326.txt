Magic is the best player of all-time!If he didn't pull a hamstring in the 89 finals against the pistons he would have 6 rings like Jordan. Magic made everybody better and could score as good as any guard in NBA History but was just so unselfish, he was the best passer of all-time (no offense to Stockon) and was even a better rebounder than Jordan. But Jordan did shoot way more than Magic and shoot a lower FG percentage. Magic all the way!
