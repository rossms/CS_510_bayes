This airport is very clean and fairly easy to get to. It is a lot better than SFO which can be a nightmare. It is actually closer to the city of Woodland than it is Sacramento, your about half an hour away from downtown. If you are traveling to the central valley or the Sacramento area this is the place to fly to.
