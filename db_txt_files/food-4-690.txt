If you're looking for a nutritious, fairly tasty cereal, Kellogg's Raisin Bran is a good bet. I have a feeling it's ranked so high on the list because the raisins are coated in sugar (unlike Post Raisin Bran, lower on the list). That way you can get your sugar fix without feeling guilty about loading sugar on top of your cereal. If it's already there, what can you do? The flakes are crispy and flavorful (for bran cereal, that is), and the raisins taste great (discussed above). As far as raisin brans go, Kellogg's is the best.
