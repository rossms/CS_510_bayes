I absolutely LOOOOOOVVVVEEE Wendy's. They have the best tasting burgers and the Spicy chicken sandwich is heavenly. Actually I just finished eating a single classic sandwich (yummy):)I think the idea of making food to order as opposed to sitting under a heat lamp all day says it all about this place. Bravo. They are Simply the BEST!!
