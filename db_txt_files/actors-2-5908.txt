Nick Spicoli was a GREAT character. But I saw Penn in an interview acting tough. He ought to just be himself. For instance, Clint Eastwood acts tough, but it's genuine. Penn's not genuine. Maybe he's technically a good actor, but when he gives an interviewer a glare like he wants to kick his ass, he's just being a big f-n jerk! He's an overrated actor. Definitely not great.
