Roethlisberger will be a good quarterback in the NFL...probably a Pro Bowl level type of guy. However, he cannot repeat the success he had as a rookie in this upcoming year, and maybe not again in his career. He isn't as good as the Steeler's record last year would indicate, but he certainly won't be a failure in the NFL either.
