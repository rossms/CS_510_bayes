Do any other Londoner's here remember the school outings where you had to eat your packed sandwiches before you ran off and tested the milking machine, meant to represent a cow's udder, with your finger? Recently the museum has held very exciting exhibitions such as which genetic family do you come from (most Europeans can trace their family line right back to just seven(?) mothers) and what technical advances c an do to create new faces and bodies for us in the future.
