Donato's is possibly the best of the delivery pizza chains. They have a dynamite thin crust pizza and very high quality toppings. I'm also very impressed with the fact that their pizza is not greasy like Pizza Hut, nor terribly sweet like Papa John's. However, I'm saddened to hear that all the Atlanta area Donato's are closing shop. I don't know why. It has been my favorite and I hope it is only temporary.
