I am still formulating my opinion about this visually stunning movie. The characters sing there way through a storyline that seems secondary to the scenery and the fantastical costumes that seem to change every time the musical score changes ... and that is quite often. The movies lighter moments made the audience laugh out loud, while some of the more touching moments seemed unimportant as the creative backdrops flew across the screen. You probably don't want to miss it but I can't say why exactly!
