The high mark of his presidency in terms of exhibiting presidential leadership and executive control was 9/11. His response to that tragedy was truly impressive, and he moved the country forward in a sensible manner. However, the majority of his domestic agenda, as well as the incompetence his administration demonstrated in executing the invasion of Iraq, is not particularly impressive. Other than 9/11 and a few worthwhile policy objectives such as his efforts to assist Africa in dealing with the HIV/AIDS crisis, Bush has botched opportunity after opportunity to achieve anything of substance.
