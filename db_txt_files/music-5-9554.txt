This is one of my favorite Madonna albums! Everything about it is so upbeat and free! I must cite True Blue as one of the greatest songs ever on this planet! And I (while I love them all) do love Open Your Heart Where's the Party Jimmy Jimmy Papa Don't Preach , Love makes the World go Round etc. Madonna has GOT it on this one! The greatest female star of the entire decade (and millenium!) Madonna RULED the 80s, and with a very well-deserved reign! She only proves it again and again! True Blue, one of the greatest albums i own!
