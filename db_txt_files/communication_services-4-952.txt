AT T is a large national company providing digital service. Started in large metropolitan areas, they still provide the best coverage. However, AT T has affiliates in smaller towns such as Cellular One that can provide adequate coverage in small and rural towns. The AT T digital service can provide caller ID and Internet access, as well as call waiting features and plans that cover long distance anywhere in the states so one never has to worry about long distance charges. A credit check and one year contract may apply, so call a dealer.
