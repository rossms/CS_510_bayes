I love enrnique! he's a cutie pie! This song is my mom-n-dad's fave. the video is really emotional and I like the drama to it. It has that movie feel to it and my mom thought it was form a movie too, like I did.I still don't know how it ends becuse VH1 cut it off to early. sux how VH1 cuts off prts of the vids like that, they cut a great deal off the vids on ther countdowns. oh well. a really cool and beautiful song with a really nice vid!!!!
