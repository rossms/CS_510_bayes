These guys should really be in St Louis - the RAMs should be in L.A. and then we could go shopping for another team. AZ Razorbacks sounds good to me. Let's put em in Bullhead City or Lake Havasu so if they play like S__t we can go swimming (Lake Havasu) or swim to Laughton from Bullhead City. Then we could really try to get lucky!
