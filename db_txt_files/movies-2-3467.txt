I didn't like it. It made no sense at all. Like after what Sheridan did, murdring and robbery. Then Gerard just let him go. And every time someone gets shot in the torso, they live. Once Sheridan got shot in the left part of his torso and lived. And why would prisioners be taken on an airplane? And it did an emergency landing an a small road, destroying everything in it's path. It's comeplete crap compared to The Fugitive.
