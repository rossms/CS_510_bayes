After years of hiring no name coaches with no past (With the exception of Bobby Ross, that has been what the Lions have done), the Lions needed Mariucci last offseason. The man really knows how to coach, and bring a group of guys together. That, and some nifty moves made (suprisingly, I might add) by Matt Millen could make Steve's sophomore season in Detroit a suprise for the NFL.
