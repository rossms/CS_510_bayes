Keith is such a solid player. I think KU suffers without him, as was proved by their loss to Mizzou. He is good under pressure, and is the player who steps up at the end of the game. If there is anything to say agianst him, its that he is not the best freethro shooter, but he makes up for it by finishing almost every shot that he puts up from a drive into the paint. He's good.
