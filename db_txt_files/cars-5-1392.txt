Probably the best buy in the luxury sports sedan market. 200hp front wheel drive car. Packed full of amenenties that no other sedan can offer at that price (ie. BMW 3-series, Volvo S-40, Audi A4, etc). Absolutely cannot go wrong buying one of the highest residual value cars on the market (only 15,000 in production).
