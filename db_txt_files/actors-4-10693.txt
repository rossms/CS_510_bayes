Did a truly fine, charming job in You Can Count On Me, working well with Mark Ruffalo in a very overlooked film. But then again, she's such a good actress that she's likely to be underrated and denied choice roles that'll go to the no-talent darlings of the mainstream media propaganda machine (i.e., Roberts, Witherspoon, etc.).
