The Blob. I have family here and so visit a lot. At first I hated it, but learned to appreciate what it has, and especially the sublime desert and mountains that surround it on all sides: now I look forward to my visits. There is a surprising amount of cultural diversity here: don't be fooled by the apparent sameness of strip malls and evenly spaced six-lane arterials. Summer is pretty grim though, with frequent temps over 110.
