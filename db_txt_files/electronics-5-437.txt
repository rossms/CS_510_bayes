I love Tivo as much as i love going to see a movie and belive me, that love. It is the all time greatest invention ever invented for the t.v. I like it better then the remot. I NEVER HAVE TO WATCH COMMERCIALS. i record what i want to watch and watch it when its conveniont. I can slow-mo a nice catch a wide reciever makes when i am watching football. I can pause LIVE tv when i need to go to the bathroom. I do not know why they don't make t.v's with Tivo equiped. If you have the slightest thought about bying Tivo, do it. It has made t.v alot more injoyable. I'll never watch regular t.v again.
