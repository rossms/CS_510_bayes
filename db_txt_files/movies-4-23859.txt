I really enjoyed this film. The plot was intriguing and although it lacked some in spots, it was majorly a unique, interesting idea. It made me sit up in my seat and pay close attention and I love a movie that can drive that kind of interest. Some parts were particularly disturbing and caused plenty of gasps. Ashton Kutcher proved my previous support of him to be worth it. He did well with dark material that wasn't slapstick for once. Amy Smart, another upcoming actress, was surprisingly good also. I found it to be terrific but obviously not for every moviegoer.
