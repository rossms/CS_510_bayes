Ah...Everquest. Well its still very big anfter being out for about 2 1/2 years, that pretty much says it all but I'll go on. The game isnt a game you play for a hour then get bored and do something else, this game is really addicting. It cost about 10$ a month to play since its an online only game. You can join giulds, preform raids, and make friends. There's no end to the game, no plot, and no objective. Just have some fun. Like I said it's very addicting and still going strong and probably will go strong for another 3 years or so.
