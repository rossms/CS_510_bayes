Possibly one of the most fun and most enduring multiplayers I've ever played. Although the gameplay is certainly an FPS, PlanetSide shares the concept of an individual levelling character with the MMORPG games. This results in a good community and the feeling of having a goal in the game - getting up to the next level. It's no RPG grinder though, since you gain points when you and your squadmates kill, and killing is what the game is all about. Dying is a big part of the game too.. bit don't worry, you'll respawn with all your levels and certs at the nearest respawning terminal.
