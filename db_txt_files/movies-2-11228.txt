I probably wouldn't see this type of movie except for my son. The first was better than the critics gave credit, and this one wasn't. It amazes me that a movie team has a good group of actors, a promising group of characters, an open-ended immensely popular fantasy, all this to work with and they produce schlock. You wonder why some person didn't volunteer at SOME point in the production that this film just wasn't working like it could.
