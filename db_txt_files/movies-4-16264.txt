I admit I enjoyed this movie when it first came out, but how incredibly goofy is Ralph Macchio? It's hard to take Ralph seriously as a big-time karate guy when he's built like a weeble-wobble: wider at the waist than he is at the shoulders. My sister could beat up Ralph Macchio, crane technique or no crane technique. Still, Karate Kid tells a good story, and Pat Morita is great as Mr. Miyagi.
