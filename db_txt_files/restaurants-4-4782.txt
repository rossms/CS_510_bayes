For a chain seafood restaurant, Red Lobster does a good job, and those who compare chains with local restaurants in key areas (eg seafood in New England) just do not get the concept here and are comparing apples with oranges. The atmosphere at Red Lobster is pleasant, the menu is diverse, and the food is palatable. Of course the biscuits (as noted in other comments) are icing on the proverbial cake.
