This, the American version of the phoenomenal Japanese monster movie is really not that bad. The inclusion of Raymond Burr was actually pretty wise, considering the fact that the dubbing was horrible. The film needed an interpretor, and Burr was the right man for the job. This is good, but I implore you to see the original un-cut version with sub-titles. You do NOT know what you're missing!
