Vinatieri: 2 game ending, game winning kicks in Superbowls. Game ending, game winning kick divisional playoffs. The patriots have never lost an overtime game since he came to the team. The only kicker who has ever been signed to national endorsement deals. I'm not sure but I wonder if a kicker has ever been inducted into the NFL's Hall of Fame and he's a first ballot shoe in!!
