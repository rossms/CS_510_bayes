Not too impressed with their clothing. It is kind of second rate style and quality. Their ad Campaign featuring Death Row Inmates was rather confusing to me..but I guess they accomplished what they set out to do..get people talking about Benetton..However I don't think this was quite the right approach! They have their right to their opinions on Capital Punishment..however I think they are going to the opposite extreme..yes these are human beings, but these are human beings that have done heinous things, unmentionable acts of cruelty. Humanity is one thing, Ignorance is another.
