Good fun , even great fun, well written and engaging, an insight into how business works. Not useful or helpful, and not intended to be either, so it suffers by that comparison with the classic business books, but a good nonfiction book, not a helpful business book in any sense of the word. Should be put into general nonfiction, where it would earn a 4 from me.
