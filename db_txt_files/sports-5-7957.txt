I used to think he couldn't shoot but then I found out it's cause he takes to the hole so much and gets free throws. Allen's a winner, and he has the toughness so many little guards don't have. I'm amazed how many people still refuse to give him his due. How many seasons does a guy have to carry his team, still average over 20 ppg and show heart and hustle before he gets recognition?
