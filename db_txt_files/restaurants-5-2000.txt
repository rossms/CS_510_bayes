Every once in a while, I get a craving for a fast food burger. Well, that craving hit me today, and I stopped by Burger King for a Whopper. Believe it or not, it was the best-tasting fast food burger I've ever had. It tasted like a burger that was cooked outside on a grill, and the bun, lettuce, and tomato were fresh and delicious. Everything about it was just right. The next time I'm in the mood for a quick burger, I know exactly where I'll go.
