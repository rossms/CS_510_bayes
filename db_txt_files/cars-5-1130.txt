Lets get things straight, Dont compare a Hyundai ANYTHING to a Honda. If a Tiburon has 160hp im sure it will not go into good use. Hyundais are the most unreliable cars available. And the Honda Civic Si may have 160hp but still does not have as much torque to outlast even an early nineties Integra(which has 138hp and is also a Honda.)The Civic Si is the TOP OF THE LINE Civic, but pitted against the Integra GSR or Type R, the Civic is a joke. Though i own a Civic and have much respect for it, do not regard it as a fast car because Acura has that department locked down.
