Of course he gets a 5 b/c he is from the best state and played for the 1 and only Alabama Crimson Tide.He is leadin the league in rushing yards and the most TD's so yeah he is alot better than Tiki Barber though Tiki is good and had a GREAT game against the chief so they are about even though Tiki needs more carries.
