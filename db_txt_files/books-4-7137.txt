One of the most exciting writing styles I've read, the author uses metaphor at a new level. The wonderful perspective on cyberspace (the metaverse), future vehicles, and undertones of political and social satire make up for the incredibly bad plot and almost nonexistant character developement. Just skim past the completely twisted religious plot, which after figuring out I wish I had skipped entirely. Still worth reading, but keep your skeptic glasses on.
