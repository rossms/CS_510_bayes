I am in a hurry to get my camera for a trip and decided to do in-store pick-up to save time. I saw the product in the store, but decide to purchase it online for supposed savings. Online they said that they had it in stock at the store near me (and I had already SEEN it with my own eyes). So I paid and then they emailed to say that it wasn't in stock in the store. I checked again, pretending to buy it again and it still says that it is in stock. So I called the 800 # and I was on hold for about 10 minutes and the call was never answered!
