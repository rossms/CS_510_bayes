These guys here probably work for someone else like Verizon, AT T or Sprint. Everyone knows that 100% of 100% of the people who rate here would not be so critical about Cingular Wireless if they were just normal consumers. As you can see, Cingular is Fantastic in my eyes, it has does what they would say they would do. If you have a problem with them, make sure you do not work for the above mentioned services. LOW LOW LOW!!
