It is hard to beat California's combination of beaches, mountains, water and sun. N California quite scenic. SF, LA and San Diego are all insanely expensive and crowded, so dont move there, but visit all of them. Take a drive along the coast. Even the interior deserts are beautiful. I am far from a republican, but I get a kick out of the Gubernator. Just please dont let him run for prez.
