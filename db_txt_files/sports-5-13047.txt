Possibly the most underrated team in all of football. Despite a stumble or two, this team moves effortlessly through personel and coaching changes to year after year contend for their slanted conference title, while beating teams that they supposedly have business being on the field with.The Rockets will start of, yet again, getting no respect in the polls, but will end up in the Top 25. If they were ever given any respect early in the season, they would be Top 10 candidates many years.
