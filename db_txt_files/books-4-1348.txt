Maybe not on the same scale as Peanuts--but then Peanuts was on a long time and didn't hit a homerum every day. The loving relationship of the couple and the pets are enough to keep me coming back. It's not meant to be the sarcastic comic....can't we have ones that are charming and heartwarming as well as the ones with all the sarcasm and hipness of some current hit comics? It may not be a Chris Rock type comic--maybe more a Jimmy Stewart and that's fine with me!
