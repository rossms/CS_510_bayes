I ve been a directv user for a few years now. I can honestly say that they are very helpful and simple to set up and offer tons of channels in their packages. In my area the price and services are both flexible and priced competitively. I also enjoy the fact that I can log onto their web site, look up programming as well as change my subscription package in a matter of minutes.
