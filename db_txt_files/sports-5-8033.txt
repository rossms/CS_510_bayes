Allen Iverson is a great player and I'm glad he he was nominated Most Valuable Player of the Year. He does it all. He carries his team and also supports them in everything they do. No matter what Allen Iverson will always be the #1 player in my book. Iveron keep doing what you are doing and stay true. You are the answer to all my problems.He has the moves and he can shoot jump shots and averages more points than I can in one game.
