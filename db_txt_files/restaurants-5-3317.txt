Great pizza! Lot's of sause and loads of good toppings. I don't know about all of the other PJ's around the states, but in my area it's the best. It's better than Pizza Hut and Domimos can't even touch it. When PJ's came to our town, there were already 5 pizza places to eat at. Now there is only three. Now does Pappa John's rule or what? Goooood Pizza!!!!!
