I have the 1997 Valkyrie Tourer. It is without question the best damn motorcycle ever made.. If what you want is a big powerful smooth running heavy steel monster that has it's own look, you got to get one..! It has tree stump pulling torque and supersonic top end..! And it's a Honda, so you know is practically bullet proof. This may be the last bike I ever own...
