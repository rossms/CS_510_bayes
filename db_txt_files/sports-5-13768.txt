Mike Sherman needs to be fired immediately. He is an awful, awful, awful coach; in fact, he is almost as bad a coach as some of you are spellers. However, your combined intelligence notwithstanding, you people, thankfully, do not attempt to lead our beloved Green Bay Packers each week. If you can find a dictionary, please submit a cohesive plea to Green Bay management to get rid of Sherman. That's S-H-E-R-M-A-N. With an "S."
