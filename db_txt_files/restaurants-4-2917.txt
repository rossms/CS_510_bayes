Such great tasting ice cream in a variety of flavors! There isn't a Ben Jerry's where I live, but the local grocery store usually sells it by the pint. The only downside is that it usually costs anywhere between $3.39 and $3.99 for a pint of ice cream. I can buy a gallon of the store's brand of ice cream for less than that. I guess once in a while, when you're facing an evening home alone, it's a good idea to buy a pint of your favorite flavor, rent a movie or two, sit on your couch, and enjoy!
