He's an awsome QB. Although I love the Tampa Bay Buccanneers, I would love to see Green Bay do well in the playoffs. Brett Favre is a QB that has made some history and probally will continue to. He's especially playing well for his age (has been in the NFL for about 15 years). He makes some smart decisions on the field. Anyway, he has had about 40 or more consecutive games with one or more touchdowns (that record was washed away a few weeks ago by the Eagles).
