Nashville is one city I could live in (prefer small towns). Everytime I go there for one event or another I like it...except I will agree that due to non stop concruction (which is a TN thing, not just Nashville) traffic can be bad. I like country though Im not a die hard, but do manage to enjoy time in Nashville.
