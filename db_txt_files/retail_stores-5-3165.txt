Can I give a DVD rental place six stars? If so, Netflix would earn them. I have not stepped foot inside a video store in nearly two years. I was sick and tired of seeing entire walls taken up with copies of Scooby Doo, and NO copies of classics like Touch of Evil and Wild Bunch (both of which are available on DVD). Netflix's selection is great--if it's available on DVD, they have it. And not just movies. Great service and prices too. I have not tried the other DVD-by-mail places (like WalMart and --gasp-- Blockbuster), but I can't imagine their selection being better.
