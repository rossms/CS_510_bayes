Even with Gene Hackman, this film cannot help its self. First SAMs move much faster than they do in the movies and second, the dialogue is terrible and extremely unbelievable. The movie still could have been salvageable, but then, the movie ends with a big hollywood stile ending which is completely unbelievable. If you like military films, you may like this, but you may also hate it because of its unbelievable parts. Pass it by, and if you like Gene Hackman, rent target instead.
