Nightlife! The fresh air! SF is one of my favorite cities in the world. The costs of living is very high here. Parking can be hard to find in alot of areas. Food! There's plenty of great restaurants here. Most people here seem smart and outgoing. I feel I can carry on a good conversation with more people in SF than in LA. Lots of things to do, you won't get bored here! No smog. You can find beauty here. It's in the air. This city was rated highest in coolness by Forbes magazine. All the different districts in SF make it a great place for exploration. Diversity of people make it even more interesting.
