This is one of the greatest cities in the world, with a truly international flair. The people tend to be rude, the food is outrageously expensive, and the persistant hawkers of custom made suits on Nathan Road can drive you crazy. However, the city itself, with its vibrant activity, skyscrapers, and mix of modern and old/Chinese and Western, more than make up for these shortcomings. Take the tram up to Victoria Peak, climb up the hill to the top of the mountain, and marvel at the city stretched before you. Hong Kong is not to be missed on a trip to Asia!
