Keith is now KU's greatest player(with or without Roy)...He is quick, he plays smart, he so good that the officials had to call booty fouls to foul him out so that Syracuse could win a game. Any real Bball fam knows that Keith doesn't rarely gets 1 maybe 2 fouls a game. Also, he's always keeps his cool in tough situations. That's how good he is...and that's how good he'll continue to be. He isn't afraid to go in the paint to get his team two points...AND 1. I see him becoming as successful as Mr. Paul Pierce is when he enters the draft.
