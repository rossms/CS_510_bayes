Raiders fan since I was a kid. The Oakland Raiders were once a team to be feared and respected but time and idiotic policies have tempered down the once mighty men in silver and black. Now us fans make up for it with a vengence. F(uck with us and you'll get the sh!t kicked out of ya. Want to committ suicide?, go to a Raiders game with a rival teams colors on and head for the restroom, we'll be happy to put you out of your misery. RAIDERS RULE!
