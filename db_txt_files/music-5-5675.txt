The BEST OZZY album. Probably the greatest metal album. Definitely one of the greatest albums of all time which features one of the greatest guitar players of all time: Rhandy Rhoades. Every song on the album is a five, and the album flows perfectly from beginning to end. Ozzy and Randy were both great songwritters. No one is a true rock fan if they don't have this one in their collection.
