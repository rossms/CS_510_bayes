A nice book to read to your kids when they're really young, if you skip the cussin words. Actually it's a nice story but the movie was sort of a bore. The story itself would only receive a 3 star from me but he movie was even worst. This is a good one for the younger youngsters b/c of all what happens. Giant peach, talking insects, that kind of stuff.
