I read The Tesseract within a week of finishing The Beach and was expecting a similar story. That certainly wasn't the case. A tesseract is a 3 dimenshional cross and this novel follows three stories presented independently in three different parts of the book. Each story comes together at the end with the single, climactic conclusion. It was beautifully written and brilliantly narrated by Garland who showed an even more imaginative mind in writing this interesting and innovative book. It wonderfully expressed the truth that every story has many sides. I definitely recommend it.
