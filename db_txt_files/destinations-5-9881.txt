Camel Filters are great cigarettes as opposed to other types and brands. Why? Because the filters are made of cotton whereas most filters are made of processed glass and harm your longs. Camel Filters are safer cigarettes to smoke. Another reason I like them is because of the way they taste: great. RJ Reynolds used good, fresh tobacco.
