Several years ago, I spent three weeks backpacking around Spain and Portugal and Toledo was my favorite city. It is absolutely stunning and even though it is close enough to be a quick day trip from Madrid, I would recommend spending at least a night there. From the tiny, unbelievably narrow cobblestone roads to the incredible architecture, Toledo is really a site to behold. The city is small enough that there is no reason to rent a car, but make sure you have comfortable walking shoes because the streets are winding and, sometimes, quite hilly. The only disappointment was that there was no sign of Klinger.
