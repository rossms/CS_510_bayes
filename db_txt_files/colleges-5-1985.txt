I have attended several universities (including Emory) and I feel my 4 years spent as an undergrad at Clemson were by far the most well-rounded and happy of my experiences. I would recommend the experience to anyone and everyone. In the 4 years since, not a day has gone by that I do not miss walking across bowman on a cool fall day or studying/sleeping in the amphitheater between classes or seeing people I know everywhere I go. Go tigers!
