James Dean was a bigger stiff when he was alive. WOW was he horrible !!! smoldering ?? brooding ??? How about boring !!! I'm sorry that he died so young , but his short career has been glorified and over rated by his tragic death. Had he lived his career would have been as glorious as Luke Perry's , who I feel shares in JD's (lack of) acting style. I give Rebel 2 stars mainly for the talents of Natalie Wood.
