At some point in my life someone gave me a box of Folgers coffee in tea bags, yes tea bags. Apparently they now sell the grounds in individual servings in the form of tea bags. Well, I thought this seemed like an idea worth trying so I boiled up a little water poured out one serving size dropped in a bag, let it brew, withdrew the bag, added the exact amounts of cream and sugar and voila! A single serving of nice and hot home brewed really bad coffee all for me! No thanks.
