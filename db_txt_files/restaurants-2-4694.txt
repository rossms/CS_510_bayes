On several unfortunate occasions, I've found myself part of the 20-something crowd that gathers at Friday's afterwork. In a search for something edible on the menu, I've sampled quite a few of the options. I haven't had a meal yet that I would consider palatable. And with the hokey (mass produced)fake mememorablia , I can't figure out the charm.
