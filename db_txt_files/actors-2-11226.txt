This girl is blandly pretty, but with very little charisma or personality. Even with red hair, she does not seem like the kind of girl that even Peter Parker would obsess over for his entire life, she is just not that special. She is indeed pretty, but not in any kind of memorable way. The only impressive thing about her Interview role was her gorgeous blond curls. She's a pretty face and there are a lot of pretty faces in the world.
