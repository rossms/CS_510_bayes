Maybe I'm wrong, but I would think that in the hierarchy among actors, daytime TV is the lowest on the totem pole. While many get their start there, the really talented ones move on to primetime and movies. Susan Lucci's long run only proves to me that she is a very mediocre actress who was never able to land a better gig.
