I had Rodnik Vodka at Rodnik's over the top party at the Sundance Film festival. Rodnik Vodka was such a hit that I tried it and wow so flavorful and smooth. The taste was not distilled out of it and Rodnik had a creamy texture to it. No more Grey Goose, Do you think if Grey Goose was a great french vodka the french would put an english word on the bottle? I think not. Rodnik is the Worlds best tasting vodka period.
