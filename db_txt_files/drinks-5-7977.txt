On a whim, I tried George Dickel the first time about 10 years ago when I was running low on my Jack D's. I had enough Jack's to try a side by side, straight-up, no water, no ice comparison. George Dickel is a hands-down winner! The fact that it was cheaper was a bonus, but I've continued to purchase on the basis of taste. Tennessee whiskys are the mellowest, but George's is moreso than Jack's. I highly recommend.
