This is the way a scary movie should be done. I love the way Hitchcock was able to evoke shock without actually showing any gore or graphic violence. Even in the most shocking scene, the knife never touched the girl. The whole scene was carried with imagery. But it worked! It is so tastefully done in contrast with the slasher films that became popular later. This movie is good because the the thrill is based on suspense, not special effects or gore (whicih goes for other Hitchcock movies as well).
