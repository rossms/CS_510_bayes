Peter Weir is back after a dearth. This is a good flick with Russell Crowe as Captain Aubry in a combo of two Patrick O'Brian Napoleonic War sea novels. I chalk it down a star for editing. It could have moved faster and told the same story. Good specials and acting, however. The props in this flick are first rate.
