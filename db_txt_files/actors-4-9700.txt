Blanchett's performance in Elizabeth was truly incredible. Her somewhat melodramatic turn in Ripley may have been simply due to trying to do to much with a role which was an insufficient vehicle for showing off her vast talent (so brilliantly displayed in Oscar and Lucinda ). However, is it not an actors' duty to play a role as part of a whole and not as if for a showreel? Theatre-wise, in the London season of 'Plenty', Blanchett was good but not awe inspiring.
