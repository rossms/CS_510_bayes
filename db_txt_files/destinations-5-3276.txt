Despite all the anti-Seattle rants, I love this city. First of all, it doesn't rain as much as people claim. Housing is affordable compared to other cities like Los Angeles. I grew up in the midwest, and find the nice laidback pace to be the right fit for me in Seattle. Traffic is getting to be horrible, and cops are almost everywhere on the highway to give out tickets. But this shows that the department of safety is out there to protect people on the highways and in the roadways. I will be moving to Seattle sometimes in the future because I miss the Emerald City.
