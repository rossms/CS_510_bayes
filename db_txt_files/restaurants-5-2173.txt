Wowie Wow Wow WOW, people! At this point, I am renouncing my American citizenship and moving to the Land of Tim Horton's. Going there on a recent trip to Montreal has effectively changed my life in the following ways: I brought back 140 dozen TimBits (mmmmm) and have purchased a new freezer so that I can store them and eat one every hour as a memory of Tim Horton's. I have also shellacked and added a strap to a TimBits box and carry it as a purse. If you have not already converted to the religion of Tim, you should really think about it, Tina.
