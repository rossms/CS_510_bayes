I'm too spoiled/sophisticated to enjoy hard candy. Two stars though: Candy is still candy, GummiSavers are related to the LifeSaver, I could eat the pineapple flavor when I was down to the last of my Halloween candy. An Interesting Fact about the candy I hate: Female Democrats who make less than 40 grand a year tend to suck their savers Male Republicans who make more than that tend to bite.
