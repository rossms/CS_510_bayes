I don't crave it often, but when I do - I REALLY crave it. Usually it's when I am eating a burger and fries. There's something about having a big juicy cheeseburger (preferably Wendy's) and a pile of greasy fries that makes me crave an ice cold coke in a glass with plenty of ice. Could it get more American than that?
