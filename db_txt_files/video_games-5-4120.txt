This game is awesome because of how realistic it is. The control of the game is good because I had a control pad instead of using the keyboard. The graphics are pretty realistic and the way the game is set up is pretty cool too, things are unexpected just as they are in real life football. Fumbles, interceptions, sacks, injuries- without these the game wouldn't be football.
