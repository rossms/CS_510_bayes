Jason Williams is the best point guard in the country. Last year, he had a tremendous year as a freshman and he has improved this year. It doesn't hurt that he has great supporting cast and a super freshman (Chris Duhon) to step in and spell him at the point. It's really amazing to me the amount of success that Duke has had through the years with freshman starting at point guard. Amaker, Hurley, Wojo, Avery all performed well as freshmen. But, Williams could be the best of them all.
