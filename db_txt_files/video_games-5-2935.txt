Could be one of the best games ever made (until GTA4 comes out). The level of detail, ability to do WHATEVER the hell you want, steal cars, fly helicopters, start riots, or even deliver pizzas is unmatched by any game out there today. I have had this game since it came out and have not yet seen or done all there is to do. GTA VC has set the standard for all other games.
