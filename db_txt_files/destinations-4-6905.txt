I have visited there several times, and have been treated really well by everyone. Ole Miss football games are always a lot of fun, and if you're into American history, Vicksburg packs an enormous amount of history into a small area. My favorite place there is the Old Courthouse Museum. It costs very little and will keep you fascinated for hours. They's also got some good tours of old plantations (McCraven is my favorite). If you don't like Mississippi, then by all means, stay out, so it will stay friendly.
