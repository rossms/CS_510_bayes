Man I used to love this album! I still might, but I think when she released the new, nicer album, I used this one as a candle holder in protest and oddly enough would not play properly after that. Nevertheless, I did enjoy this album a lot. Alanis is great chick rock (and I don't use great and chick rock in the same sentence too often) and she's just so angry! It's great! Then she got all happy and unfortunatly a woman like Alanis singing happy songs just doesn't have the same effect.
