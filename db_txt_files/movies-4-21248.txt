This one will be a movie that can convince you to go to the state. I may say that if it is what it look like back then, I would certainly want to visit. It's a darlin' movie that shows lots of vivace in their songs. Sure, the boring part is the dream segment, but overall, it is good. Not bad to transfer the classic Rogers & Hammerstein play into a movie.
