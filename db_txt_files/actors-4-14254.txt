The plastic surgery is a bit much, but it is also her choice. As for her personal life, bad things can happen to anyone. She had an addiction, and she went to rehab, and did something about the problem. I say good for her, it only shows that she is human. And for Antonio to stand by her like that, it also shows what a good relationship they have. They love each other, and he's a good guy for not calling it quits when In sickness and health came into question. Her acting is not bad either. She has made some very good role choices, and some not so great. Even when she's at her worst, she is still memorable.
