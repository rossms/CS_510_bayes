Do you like Green Eggs and ham? I Do, I Do Sam-I-Am! What a great story especially reading them to kids. I will always remember the times when I am young as I read the story to my niece. How little Sam-I-Am never stopped asking the man if he would eat green eggs and ham anywhere has a vauled lesson of being perssitant never giving up and always trying. That is a great lesson to learn from this book.
