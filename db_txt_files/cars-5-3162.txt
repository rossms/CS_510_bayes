I have a 2001 SR5 and i have not had a problem out of it for 90k miles. I travel alot and i have not been stranded once. It does great in the snow and Ice. The mud gives it no problem either. I have not done any major repair to it and does not look like i will need to for quite some time. It has a V6 (not the best gasmileage in the world) however the gasmialage is better than a lot of V6 SUVs out there. I would recomend this vehicle to anyone. Unlike Buzzbomber's 97 the 2001 is not uncomfortable on long trips at all.
