I was lucky to spend a few months in St Petersburg, what a fantastic place, full of history, arts, culture and great nightlife. There is so much to see and do, I was never bored. Whether you want ballet or rock, museums or night clubs, it is all there. And it is generally safe as well. I go back whenever I can!
