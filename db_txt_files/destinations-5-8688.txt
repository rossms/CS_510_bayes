skoal is the all time best dip im a high school student and skoal pouches are the only way i get through class but a dip of cope or cope black isnt bad every once in a while but mint is the best and the new apple isnt that bad either i rate it five because theres so many flavors and i dont have to stick to one flavor but i just cant stand cherry and any one who says skoals for pansys is just missin out
