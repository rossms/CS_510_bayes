This review is for the 1997 model. This car is very well designed, comfortable and has very good reliability. Having maintained it well over the last 2 years, I have had no major problems with it. I think the front end styling leaves something to be desired, but overall it is a good looking car, certainly better than many American sedans of the era. It is safe, quiet and overall an excellent buy.
