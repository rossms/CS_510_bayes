Istanbul is a magical city that is too often overlooked by Americans traveling through Europe. Bridging East and West, Istanbul blends cultural, religious, and political traditions in a way that no other city in the world can. The Turkish people I encountered were warm and friendly and proved to be avid conversationalists with a curiosity for the world beyond their immediate borders. Not to be missed are visits to the Grand Bazaar, Topkapi Palace, and a boat trip on the Bosphorous.
