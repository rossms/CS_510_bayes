I would have given Kellog's Raisin Bran 5 stars, but lately their two scoops of raisins has turned into three or four! I don't know if they're being generous or if it just helps the box weigh more, but I liked it better when it was two - or two and a half. Too many damn raisins now. But still the best Raisin Bran cereal on the market!
