Gladiator is the newest epic to hit the big screen. Aside from the sometimes excessive fighting, this movie is definitely a great one. Lacking character development this will never be known as a classic. But don't get me wrong, you'll have a lot of fun watching this one. The violence is a little too much for the movie's sake, but definitely appeals towards the pop culture of today. A lot of fun.
