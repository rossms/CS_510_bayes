Whether you're a fan of skateboarding or extreme sports in general, this is by far the best game on the gamecube so far. It certainly was the best release date game. Lots of tricks, mutiple huge levels with multiple tasks, and MANY hidden secrets will equal in hours, days ,weeks, months worth of fun. The controls are easy to figure once you've played for a bit (especially with the tutorial). Beautiful detailed graphics in every stage and on every skater. It's the 1st GAME for the cube. A MUST BUY FOR ALL!
