Wanna escape reality? Head for Vegas. What's particularly enticing about this city is that it fits most every budget imaginable, the food is fantastic and the airport is about a 5 minute drive from the strip. However, due to the semi-ubiquitous sleaze factor there, regretably, it loses a star..still definitely worth traveling to should you ever get the chance.
