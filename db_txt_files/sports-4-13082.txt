The Aggies are a Top 20 team. This is a fact too. ESPN had a Top 20 teams of all time and I am positive they were 20th. Check it out. The Ags have been down the past couple years, but will soon be back in the National spotlight. I would like to refrech that dude's memory at the top... Since about 1985 when Jackie Sherril was the coach the Aggies won the SWC almost every year and contended for the National title in the early 90's. Oh and The Aggies did have an undefeated team in 1994. Do your homework. The Aggies will soon climb back into the national spotlight next year if not this year.
