Target is the bomb! They have the best workout clothes, home decor, gift items, shoes and accessories! I don't know what I did before Target came along. Now I can afford Pottery Barn and Crate and Barrell type items when I shop at Target. My only dissatisfaction is with their return policy. It discourages me from buying things if I'm indecisive about something. Without your receipt you can only exchange it for the exact same item. Who wants those lousy paper receipts lying around their house all the time! What a painful mess!
