I'm a big fan of Fords, and I love the idea that they took an F-150, lowered it, put custom rims, wider tires, and stuck a blower on it. Also, that instead of having the pipes come out in the back, they come out from the side. That really makes it look high-performance. Even though I don't own one, I can guarantee it could smoke a Chevy Camero Z-28 (I can tell this from its performance specs).
