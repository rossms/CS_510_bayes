R.E.M was trying to figure out how to function without Bill Berry around, and they did a helluva job of it. My favorite song is the misnamed Hope ...very touching and Stipe did a terrific job on the vocals. The Apologist has an amazing Mike Mills on whatever instrument he was playing at the time, and the rest of the songs are memorable pieces with a lot of fantastic experimentation in the music and lyric. Good work, REM, and take care, everyone!
