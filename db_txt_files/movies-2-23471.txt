I didn't like Signs that much at all. It seems as though it's trying to give the theory that there is divine intervention and everything that happens occurs for a reason. That is the only theme. The movie itself was not very good. There was just some aliens that come to take over the world and one comes into the house and Mel Gibson's brother beats him senseless with a baseball bat. I was baffled at how Signs was praised by critics and John Q was shunned. I guess anything critical of a government institution will be looked down upon.
