this movie was just plain dumb.Richard Gere played a good looking gynecologist that woman had crushes on. He alway had tons of woman in his office wanting appointments with him. HIs own wife was a flake who ended up in a rehabilitation center. THe cast was way too big to give a hoot what happened to any of them. Just a movie about a bunch of mostly unlikabe people. sorry I even rented this junk of a movie.
