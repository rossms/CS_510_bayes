I went to the Cold Stone Creamary in California and I thought it was great the kids seems to enjoy singing for everyone and it added a cheerful atmosphere to the place It was not dirty,if pieces of food fell down they were cleaned up,it was super busy people loved it I think some of these reviews are made by people who are not happy or are trying to give it a bad review for a purpose but its really a special place for the fun loving and icecream enjoyers for the rest cheerup you only go around once you know
