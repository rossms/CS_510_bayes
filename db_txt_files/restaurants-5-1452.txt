I live in Oklahoma City, home of Sonic Drive-In. I really like Sonic and it has always been good except for a brief moment in the late 80's when they all changed into Stars Drive-Ins. I am not a huge fan of Ice Cream but I love their #2 Cheeseburgers, tater tots, frito pies, chili cheese coneys, grilled cheese and cream slushes. Actually, just about everything there is good to me.
