Knock Fisher down and he brushes himself off and comes back with a vengence. He is one of the reasons Im a Titans fan. During the transition from Houston to Nashville he maintained a 500 record though his team was playing for tiny crowds, his first season in the new venue with the new look and name, he went to a superbowl. In the new facilities when they didn't have tapes of upcoming opponents he had a local sports bar tape the game his opponent was playing. He is talented, intellegent, and a great communicator and leader.
