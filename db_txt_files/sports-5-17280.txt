The Philadelphia Eagles are a great team that deserve more credit than they get. They've been to the NFC championship game just about four years in a row. I really think that this is the year that they could get their first superbowl win in franchise history. The Eagles also really showed me in the game against the Vikings that they can still play their great passing game even without the presence of TO (Terrell Owens).
