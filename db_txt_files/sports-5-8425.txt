Awesome player and a great person. There isn't anything this guy can't do, well, except maybe play solid D, but he's working on it. If Grant Hill wasn't made of glass, who knows how good the Magic would be. Actually, speaking of Hill, do you think McGrady's wishing he had Ben Wallace guarding the paint and grabing every rebound for him. That trade isn't looking to good for Orlando nowadays.
