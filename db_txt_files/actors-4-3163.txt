 russell crowe is a rogue . russel crowe is a rebel . these are the most commom descriptions of him which i find funny. for me, when i see russell onscreen i feel a powerful innocence. in gladiator or the insider or la confidential he's sexy, or he's moving or he's sympathetic, but it's the innocence that knocks me over. that's where the powerful magnetism comes from and that's why he wasn't right for his role in vituosity. but he does have a reputation and that kind of ruins him for me because i don't go for the bad boy thing.
