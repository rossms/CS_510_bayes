I have not yet finished Chrono Cross, so this may change--but I doubt it! This game rocks. It is almost as good as Final Fantasy 7, my personal favorite Square game. I never even played Trigger, and this game rocks. Wonderful, engaging story and characters that are believable and fun. Having such a large array of characters works because they are distinct, and there are no deadwood characters. You just want to keep playing and playing...
