New York is not a city, it's an experience. The spirit of the city has gone though. 9/11 has shattered it. I know many will probably dissagree but it is definately not the same place it was before 9/11. This is the one place in North America that feels America is now vulnerable. Thankyou to the Marines giving their lives to restore confidence to all Americans to return to a peaceful life free of terror.
