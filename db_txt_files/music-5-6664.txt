This album is much better than their last studio effort Toxicity. That says a lot considering this is suppose to be an album of extras that were not a part of the first two albums. The fast paced songs are more aggressive, and the style reflects more of the first album (which is considered by most of their fans to be the better album). If ya like Toxicity, you'll love this album). If you didn't, then try this one out. It will not dissapoint.
