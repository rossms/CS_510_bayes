You may have heard 'Higher' and 'With Arms Wide Open' God knows how many times. At least these were songs worth overplaying. Infact, you could say the same about this entire album. This is just a CD filled with good rock tracks of all sorts. Who would ever thought positivity could sound so heavy and awsome. What If, Say I, and Beautiful are among the best tracks off this great album
