The republican congressman from Texas is among my favorite politician. He's actually a libertarian. Probably the only republican congressman or senator to vote against the Iraq war. Not afraid to take an unpopular stance in doing what's right. Ron Paul is the most fiscally conservative representative and was awarded the highest rating by the National Taxpayers Union. He has sided with a sound money policy and wishes to move to a gold standard. On the social side he has argued for the legalization of marijuana.
