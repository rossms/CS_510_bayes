Joseph Cotten didn't have the aw shucks good guy charm of James Stewart, the British appeal of Alec Guinness or Laurence Olivier, the suaveness of Clark Gable, the angst of James Dean, the wry sense of humor of Cary Grant, the naturalness of Spencer Tracy, or the staccato way of speaking like James Cagney. But what he did have was an ubiquitous appeal. He wasn't too much of a showy actor and not too understated either. He appeared in some great films Citizen Kane, The Magnificent Ambersons, The Third Man, The Farmer's Daughter, Shadow of a Doubt, Portrait of Jennie and more.
