I think Boston is a pretty nice city to visit. There is a lot of stuff to do. There are many museums, shopping malls, fine restaurants, parks, stores, cafes, and lots of other fun places to go to. Boston also has good colleges and hospitals. The traffic is terrible though. It's probably better to take the T or a bus around Beantown.
