This movie more than annoyed me. The screeching thing in the cellar was not at all scary, more likely to make you scream from frustration than horror. The acting sucked, but so what, alot of times the worst actors play in great movies. The story could have been so much better, if it had not been so annoying. The potential lost in this movie is sad.
