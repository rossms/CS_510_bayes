Maybe the most dominating defensive tackle to ever play the game. Also very intelligent. CoSIDA All-American, successful banker, excellent planner as the athletic director who has built the USF program from scratch. Dadgum...why wasn't this guy a Husker? Co-SIDAs aren't supposed to be at OU! Just kidding, my former Big 8 bretheren. Oh, yeah... he's an NFL Hall of Famer, too. You've got to wonder if this guy has a big yellow S on his chest and a red cape on his back when he steps out of a phone booth. The epitome of class and success on and off the field both during and after his playing career.
