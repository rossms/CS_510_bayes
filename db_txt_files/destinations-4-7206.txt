I loved this city. The climate is good. The beer gardens are just one of the best ideas ever. The Oktoberfest, well, I attended 13 consecutive Oktoberfests, and that was enough, but it is certainly worth visiting. The museums are fantastic. It is a great city to walk around in. The people are pretty friendly (in comparison to other German cities, but be warned, that is not saying too much - but at least you know where you stand with them). Summer in Munich is just fantastic. If you stay there, stay in the city and out of the suburbs. They soured my Munich stay.
