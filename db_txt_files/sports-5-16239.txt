Anybody who doesn't respect McNair hasn't seen him play. He has NO run support and a terrible offensive line. Nobody has to throw downfield more often than McNair and nobody has to throw on the run as often as McNair. Even so, he still has strong stats. Meanwhile, McNair plays with injuries that would sideline anyone outside of Favre. There are better pure quarterbacks out there, but nobody carries their team like McNair...
