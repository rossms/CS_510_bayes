Went to grad school at RU. Suffers from the fact that it is in NJ(no need to explain) and has some of the worst D-1 sports in history. Academically is is 1st rate, but I disagree with the poster who said the alumni network was good. As an alum its got some of the worst alumni systems Ive ever encountered.I give it a 5 based on a great campus and great academics.
