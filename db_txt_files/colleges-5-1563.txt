The U.S. Military Academy is think-tank of common sense from an academic standpoint. Make all take cadets take every subject under the sun and see who can hack it. Most often, the truly motivated will survive. Unfortunately, the Academy is not an accurate depiction of regular Army life. The curriculum and time demands are so stringent that graduates will not know what to do with themselves when they enter the Army.
