This is definitely one of my favorites!! I always enjoy coming here, because it is such a fun and outgoing atmosphere, and the staff is really wonderful! The food is awesome and original, and it always leaves me wanting more...as soon as I get over the initial fullness! My favorite thing to order is actually off the kids meal, which is kind of strange, considering that I am 17...but, its the best! It is the grilled cheese sandwich and it comes with unlimited (fantasticly seasoned) fries. I always get the lemonade, which is just perfect!! Great stuff, lots of options, great burgers, etc..
