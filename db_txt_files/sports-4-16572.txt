He's a ProBowler this year for a reason. He's leading a very successful offensive attack in Seattle. The problem is, the bigger half of that attack is Shaun Alexander. Seattle has a fantastic line, maybe even the best in the NFC at the moment. Hasselback has the good fortune of having all those things going for him as well as a deep recieveing core to throw to. He is the best QB in the NFC at the moment... That's not saying much.
