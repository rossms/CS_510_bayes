Bonds is a certain first ballot hall of famer and is still playing at the top of his game. He has been overshadowed in recent years by Griffey, Pedro, McGwire, and Sosa, but no one has been as successful with as little a supporting cast. He can still crush the ball and, while no longer a gold glove left fielder, can still play better defense than most players.
