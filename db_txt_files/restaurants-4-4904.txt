I absolutely love the salad bar--I haven't yet found a place that tops that salad bar (if you do know of one, let me know). Prices are fair, selection is pretty good (I usually just go for the soup salad, though, just because I know I'll end up gorging myself at the salad bar so I won't have room for anything else). The people who work there are great (at least at the one I frequent; the other three locations I've been to have been fairly nice, too). Overall, good dining experience.
