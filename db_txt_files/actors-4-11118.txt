I think Ms. Kidman is a great actress. Yes she has made some bad movie choices...but ever notice how those movies were with her ex? To Die For was a great dark comedy. Moulin Rouge is one of my favorite movies and she was terrific. Cold Mountain is another good movie that she is great in even though Renee Zellewegger steals every scene she is in. I hope that Ms. Kidman does a comedy. Something stupidly funny, that would show her acting versatility.
