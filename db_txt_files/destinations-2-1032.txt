Looks hot and boring to me. Lots of pale skinned people with red cancerous blisters running around with nasty English speaking accents. Not to mention the fact that everythings deadly poisonous apart from the people. My recommendation is that you come to us and let that bug festering rock become a breeding ground for crocs and snakes.
