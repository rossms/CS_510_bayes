Okay heres the thing, the movie itself was entertaing but i won't watch it again. Personally the beginning scene was the best scene of the movie. The subject of the movie was about how he knew death's moves before they happened and he needed to make a plan to stop the killing. Well boys and girls it was a good idea but instead bombed. The movie was just there! I walked out feeling nothing. I'm seriously sick of all these big budget teenager horror movies. I'm sorry but they were over when I Know What You Did Last Summer came out.
