Bought a 2002 Sentra. Thought it would be as good on initial quality as my old '86 Sentra. Boy was I wrong! The damn thing had only 200 miles on it when it showed signs of a rear main seal leak. Unacceptable for a new car. Nissan has lost its way in terms of quality. I guess that's a result of the Renault influence! Doesn't matter if the dealer fixed it. This is something that should show up at about 100K miles at the earliest -- not on a new car. I'll never buy another Nissan again because of this.
