Buy, Sell, Trade. Great fun for the whole family for both kids and adults. Giving kids a good chance at winning (unless dad decides to play the shrewed business man). Added fun in the game.... Try this!!! Whenever a player lands on free parking that player gets to create a new board rule anyone who breaks rule owes $500. This can be anything from not picking your piece up when moving to never touching your face. Half hour of the rules piling up you don't know what you can do anymore :P Have fun
