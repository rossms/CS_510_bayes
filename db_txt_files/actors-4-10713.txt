You can always cownt on Frances McDormand for an outstanding performance, and her Oscar for Fargo was well-deserved(Oh yaaah). The MooCow's favorite performance, cowever, remains in Blood Simple, one of her first roles. SHe has the chameleon-like ability to alter herself to fit any role she plays in, and always demands the audience's attention on screen. A classy lady, and an excellent American actress.
