Loved it... UOP gave me the opportunity to learn in an environment and with a schedule conducive to my personal/work life. They have state of the art tools that other colleges are trying to take advantage of and learn from in order to help their students. Those who rated UOP poorly are probably those who could not handle the expectations (THINK ABOUT IT). The team groups were great I made lifelong friends through this program. I WAS HAPPY WITH THE $ I SPENT AND I RECEIVED A GREAT EDUCUATION... EDUCATION IS ONLY WHAT YOU PUT INTO IT.. CAN'T EXPECT MUCH IF YOU DON'T PUT IN THE EFFORT...
