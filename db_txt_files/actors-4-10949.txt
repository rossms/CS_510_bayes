Jennifer Connelly reminds me of a fifties girl. She has that quality about her that is angelic in a stocky way. There is more to her than Hollywood storylines will allow on screen and that is a shame. She is naturally pretty without makeup and it is obvious. She reminds me of a lot of girls in Huntington Beach, California whom drive a classic car like a 54 Corvette painted in sky blue and listens to bands like 'The Cramps', 'The Big Wu', and 'Cave Cat Sammy'. I like this actress and I hope that she is in better upcoming films.
