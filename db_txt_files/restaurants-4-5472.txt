I've only been to a Waffle House once and I considered it a treat because they don't have too many of them in the Midwest. The one I ate at was in Oklahoma City, when I was driving down to Texas to visit a friend. I liked it. The waffles were nice, hot and crispy and the bacon was good too. The service could've been a bit better, but I like the fact you can sit at the counter and order food.
