Loved it. Even though I heard the second movie was greater. Actually, I was a little disappointed in finding out that Tyler Mane wasn't going to play Sabretooth in the second film. Hopefully Bryan Singer will bring him back in the third film. And I thought Halle Berry was an excellent choice in the part of Storm.
