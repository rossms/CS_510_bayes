They arent very exciting team. Thats a fact(surely except Miller), but till thiss season they play very consecutive, hard workin and for me one of the most interesting basketball team. Today only Reggie, then Jalen and maybe Jermaine can fight for the honour of the Indianapolis club, its no good, trades are needed I think.
