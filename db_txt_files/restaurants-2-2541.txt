It's well known that McDonald's is crap, but I'll give them a bonus star for good fries and apple pie. And the Quarter Pounder, which I used to love, and would still eat if I could somehow forget for a few minutes SuperSize Me, Fast Food Nation and everything I've heard over the years about their meat, preparation, etc. It's kind of pitiful that McDonald's has given up on commercials that prominently feature their food, relying instead on that god-awful jingle that I think contains subliminal messages...
