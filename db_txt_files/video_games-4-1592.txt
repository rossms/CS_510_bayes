I was an avid Dreamcast player for several years, and grew to love the NFL2k series of games. I was fairly skeptical of getting a Madden release because before the dreamcast I got tired of it seeming that every release was the same. I must say that the 2002 version of Madden has been extremely pleasing for me. The gameplay for the most part is great. The only thing that keeps it from being a 5 star game is that the passing system seems a bit strange at time. When there is an open player and you throw him the ball, he should catch it, and not drop it every time.
