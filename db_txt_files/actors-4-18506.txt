Allen's early films were filled with brilliant oddball humor, but most of what followed has made it difficult to remember how close he was to Monty Python and other great absurdists. Many of his more mainstream films have been interesting (Zelig, Annie Hall, Radio Days) and worthy of his legend, but he's also had a lot of misses over the years.
