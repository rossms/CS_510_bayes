No doubt the best cigarette I have ever smoked. I am a totally addicted smoker. I used to smoke Marlboro Lights, and bummed a Camel Light off a friend. I was sold. They are so smooth and so satisfying. Not nearly as harsh as Marlboro Lights. I have also smoked the Camel Filters, but they are too strong for me. I would highly recomment these to any Marlboro Lights smoker.
