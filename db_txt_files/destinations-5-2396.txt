If you are coming from the West, prepare for a serious culture shock. I happen to be someone who enjoy's culture shock, so it was a wonderful place for me. I have never felt so far from home yet so comfortable at the same time. The sound of the prayer call coming from the minarets 5x a day is something I will never forget as long as I live. The Blue Mosque and Hagia Sophia are like nothing I had ever seen in my whole life. If you are feeling a little courageous, try going to a Turkish Bath, you will be glad you did. Take a trip to Istanbul and have your mind blown.
