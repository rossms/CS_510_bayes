For frozen pizza, Di Giorno is really good! While nothing beats a genuine Chicago pizza, this one is certainly even better than some of the mass-produced chain-restaurant pizzas that I've had delivered! It's definitely my #1 choice for a frozen pizza. The vegetable and spinach/mushroom varieties are both excellent.
