The school is really strong academically and the network connections available to you are really helpful. The school is diverse and you do have the opportunity to either be a slacker or a hard-core student. Basically, you can have a full college experience here. However, the school is rather expensive if you are from middle income (rich can pay, poor get financial aid) and there is a large gap between rich and poor student, real majors and B.S. majors, Greeks and non-greeks, and the area of LA itself to deal with. It has its weaknesses, but I'm have no regretts deciding to go here.
