Roy Williams is a good practice coach but not in games. He doesn't call time-outs when needed he doesn't pull players out when needed. In my opinion Roy Williams shouldn't have left Kansas but he did and there's nothing I can do about that. Good luck to him at North Carolina because he is sure going to need it.
