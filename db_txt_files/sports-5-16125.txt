Listen, this guy is the greatest weapon in NFL History hands down, bar none best ever at what he does. Comon now, a QB that runs a 4.3 40? no way and his gun for an arm. Just imagine what this team would be or what he would be if he had a legit reciever to throw to i.e. Torry Holt or say for instance Joe Horn.
