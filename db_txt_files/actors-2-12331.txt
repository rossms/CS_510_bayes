She is stuck up and very fake. How can she have so much black pride when the only parent she claims is a white woman. She makes me wanna puke. I try to steer clear of her flicks. I'm tired of her boobs. She really loves showing them off. Who let this wench get all high and mighty??? I heard she asked for more $ from Revlon after she won best actress. She should be glad her face is used in a make-up ad at all, since it's not that spectacular.
