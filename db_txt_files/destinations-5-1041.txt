Australia is undoubtedly one of the world's best countries. I'd say this, considering I am Australian, but let's face it, we're sports-talented for a country our size, there are barely any slums, we have a strong economy, we have an illustrious war heritage, we dominate the Commonwealth Games, we did well in the Sydney Olympic Games, our beer is incredible and the new and old blend does wonders for the skyline. Enough said.
