One of my favorites. Not a true Bock in the purest definition, and at 17.5%abv. certainly not what one would expect from a beer. I have several cases of the 1994 and 1995 vintages that I sample periodically. The 1994 seems to be holding up a bit better. The alcohol bite has mellowed significantly into a heady and very complex drink. This beer reminds me more of an aged port or sherry than a traditional beer.
