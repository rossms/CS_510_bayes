This guy is basically the buffoon of the Kennedy family - the least intelligent, least talented, least driven brother. Top that off with the unbelievably sketchy story surrounding the night he had some young girl in his car and drunkenly drove it off a bridge, leaving her to drown, and you have someone who should not be in a position of power. What am I missing here?
