Ever since I purchased the buddy-brush my life has been as wonderful as a bouquet of roses. Each morning I rise from my bed and brush my unruly hair with this fabulous product. Just the thought of using the buddy-brush gives me a natural high. Its fine plastic handle makes me get all tingly when I touch it. Oh how I wish I could have all the buddy-brushes in the world.
