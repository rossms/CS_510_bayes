Hey, If you want to see a classic, epic movie go see something else. I have watched scooby doo for the past 22 years and this movie is great if you are a scooby fan. It plays off of the ridiculous nature of the show and it is totally funny. I think I only stopped laughing for 5 minutes during the entire movie. If you like the show, you will like the movie.
