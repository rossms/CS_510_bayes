Vivien Legh's portrayal of Blanche DuBois at the point in her life that this movie was made, makes her perrformance even more astounding. As always she does a wonderful job. The fact it was filmed in Black and White simply adds to the symbolic significance of this movie. It's wonderfully written and perfectly acted. As incomprhehnsible as Brando was in some places, his portrayal of Stanley is incomparible to any other.
