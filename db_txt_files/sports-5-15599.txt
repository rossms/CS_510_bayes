All those that rate McNabb a one-star just for the heck of it really need to stop. #5 is an amazing player and all those who do not agree should be frowned upon. He had lead his team to three conference championships. Thats where the criticizations come in. Many people say he failed his team all those games, which is not true. He can not be forced to take all of the blame -- maybe some -- but not all. He would have a better rating if he had better WR's, which is too bad Owens is taken; even with his attitude.
