I think Indiana really decided to fire Knight about four months ago. But it would have ruffled too many feathers to just tank him at that point, so IU cleverly decided to give Knight enough rope to hang himself. And, to the surprise of none, hang himself he did. Knight's style of coaching through intimidation just doesn't work anymore, and he's not willing to change. I, for one, will miss the spectacle of his courtside rants. But anyone as arrogant, stubborn, and intolerant as Bobby Knight doesn't deserve to be Coach anymore.
