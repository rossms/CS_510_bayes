This is the most original album Alice has done in years! It is not a concept album... it is like Killer or Love It To Death, it's just the most thought up album. My favorite track is Man Of The Year. I wish Alice was more popular cause this album would be on the top of the charts right now if his record label had thought of maybe advertising it more. GO OUT AND GET THIS! It will remind you that Alice Cooper aint out of the scene yet!
