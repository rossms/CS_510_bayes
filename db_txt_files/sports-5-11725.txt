I'm still waiting for someone, ANYONE, to tell us why he dropped out so early, and so close to beating Peyton's record. We used to go watch him play back when he was in college, (at Oklahoma State, I might add) and he was amazing - even better in the NFL. He cheated himself and all his fans when he retired so young.
