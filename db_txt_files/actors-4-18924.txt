I'm not sure what to make of Tony Scott. If I didn't know better, I would never have guessed that Top Gun and True Romance were made by the same director. Top Gun was such a perfect summer-time cliche-filled crowd-pleaser, while True Romance was a dark, quirky, character-driven film. And then he's done movies like Beverly Hills Cop II that are just plain bad. But Top Gun is fun to quote, I really like True Romance, and Crimson Tide was pretty good, too, so I'll give Scott four stars instead of three.
