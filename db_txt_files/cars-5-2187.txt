300zx ownz..stop comnparing it to a supra. COMPARE A SKYLINE TO A SUPRA (thats how it is in japan). many upgrades (not as much as a civic or an eclipse). get up to stage 3 and your gonna want to get to at least a stage 8. SKYLINE OWNS SUPRA. supra does beat 300zx. for the money, style, performance and speed. Its a 5 star. Buy a 1990-1996 300zx instead of that crappy civic, integra, mustang, prelude, etc. UNLESS YOU ARE A FAMILY MAN.. then this isnt the car for you. stillen jim wolf technology HKS stands behind the 300zx fully
