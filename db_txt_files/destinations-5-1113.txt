A FANTASTIC vacation destination! Cheaper to fly over there from Virginia than to Nevada! Carried a back pack and used train tickets to get EVERYWHERE and LOVED IT! Great history, spectacular places, interesting people and delicious food! Toured Malta, Palermo, Naples, Rome, Pisa, Florence and Venice and a few little towns in between. Been there several times and I want to go back and do it again!
