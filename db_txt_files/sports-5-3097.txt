Ty Cobb has to be the greatest hitter ever. I don't know why so many people say it is Ted Williams, who was no doubt great, but, Ty Cobb played before 1920 when the spitball was made illegal. Also in 1920 they began making use of more than one or two balls per game so that the hitter had an advantage over the pitcher. These two new rules made hitting a lot easier for Williams.
