I have a question has anyone had Banana Twolf b4? I always loved timberwolf peach before skoal stole that flavor but T-wolf stole apple right back and it tastes like candy... i find myself doing alot of pouches since skoal apple pouches came out even tho apple is the worst kind of pouches i enjoy wintergreen and copenhagen straight pouches. My next tin is definatly a Kodiak Ice
