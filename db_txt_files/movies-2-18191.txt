Okay, so I suppose I will have to rescind a few of my earlier comments about this movie. I guess the mall is an okay place to go..A hell of a good place if you ask a few of my friends (hmm). Still not a super movie, zombies are really, really stupid and it's ever so hokey, but hey, if I had to choose someplace to go I'd rather be with my buds. But, if there were cute guys going to a, say, ISLAND on a say, BOAT..than hell with the mall. (not that there aren't any cute guys going to the mall :) Movie is stupid reguardless, though.
