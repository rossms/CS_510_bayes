Seattle is the most laid back city I have ever visited.Once I arrived it felt like a huge burden had been lifted off my shoulders.It puts you in a different frame of mind.Its as if you go into slow motion.The clean crisp Northwest air is very pleasing to the senses.Despite its dismal weather,when the sun is out,Seatlle is a sight to behold.Between the magnificent skyline and and the gorgeous mountains to the multitudes of enormous well nourished trees.Seattle is very safe.I never once felt threatend walking around for hours on end.
