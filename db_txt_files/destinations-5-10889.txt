Cedar point is a wonderful theme park. They have the best coasters there. I would have to say that the Iron Dragon is my favorite. They have real fun water rides there as well {Thunder Canyon is the best} They have a variety of rides like coasters and they have rides for little kids. I would have to say that Cedar point is one of the biggest parks and they have the most coasters than any other park and they have the tallest coaster in the world which is the Millenium Force. I would recommend this park to everybody. This park is enjoyable for people young and old.
