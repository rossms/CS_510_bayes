Can't complain one bit, my service is exceptional. Would never go back to satelite which was such a joke and they get you with there contracts.I get way more channels with Adelphia compared to direct tv -they charge you for every group of channels especially if you really like certain channels they say 4 channels mabe in 4 different packages and in order to get them you have to get 4 diff packages which cost way more then regular cable. Trying to get someone to come out and fix your picture with satelite is a waste of time to cuz they charge you $90.
