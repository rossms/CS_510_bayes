Here is a vehicle that is just Okay. The ride is great on smooth roads, but it feels like the thing will shake apart on some of the gravel roads on which I drive. The gas milage for a v6 should be better than 16. I had a van before, and the explorer only offers the illusion of cargo capacity. 4 people can ride comfortably, the sound system is great, and the one I have has leather option package, and that is nice enough. It has plenty of pickup. Yet, I know there is something better out there, and after having a van I am constantly disappointed on how little I can get in the Explorer.
