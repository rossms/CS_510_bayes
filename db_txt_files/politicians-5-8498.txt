Ronaldus Magnus. Likely the greatest president of the 2oth century. Restarted the crippled economy that Carter gave us, despite the spiraling deficits engineered by the Demoncrat congress. It took Bill Clinton to finally kill the Reagan Economy. Along with John Paul II, brought down the Soviet Union. It's amazing all the lefty-loonies who can't face the truth about this great american hero. Sad.
