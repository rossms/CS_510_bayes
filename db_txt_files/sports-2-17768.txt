This team may be on the rise because of attention to the defense during the off season. Signing Chike Okeafor was important, because now you have 3 experienced Defenseiv Linemen on a team that was one of the wort in the legue against the run last year. Ray Rhodes was hired to coach the defense. Sean Alexander is always a threat to score, so that shouuld take pressure off Hasselback and the passing game. The Seahawks will finish second in the NFC West thanks to a stupid management decision by the San Fran powers that be.
