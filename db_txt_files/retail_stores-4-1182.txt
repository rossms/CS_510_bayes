I would agree with you People, but I been to the big outlet stores in Indiana and the Bugle boy store had some nice stuff and good prices, it was up to date with style and it was good quality clothing better than alot of crap other companies make for alot more money. I will agree on this, they had some stuff I wouldn't wear, and a few things were out dated by far, they had some stuff that was up to date and nice clothing also and the stuff fits great , a company that isn't afraid to put a little material into their clothing.
