How incredibly cute! It's kind of an introductory to counting (in a way), names of the days of the week, and biology (caterpillar metamorphizing into a butterfly) with whimsical and colorful illustrations. The different-sized pages, some with holes, make it a little more interactive than normal rectangular board books. It's definately a book I'll want to get for my children someday.
