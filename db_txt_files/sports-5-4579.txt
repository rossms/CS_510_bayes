I'm a Syracuse grad and have to admit, Calhoun is an elite coach, and he gets the best of my Orange team too often. I saw a banner at an UConn-Syracuse game recently- Jimmy C vs. Jimmy B...nothing but class. That banner said it all. But Calhoun is right there with his colleague and friend. One of the very best.
