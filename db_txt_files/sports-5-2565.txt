He woundn't be pay 2million for each win if he made all the desisions. He get sut out of a lot of discisions by George. Cashmans a genious, plain and simple. The yanks would never have got Giambi, Boone, Contrares, Loften, Wollmack, and Weaver if George wasn't a idiot. And Brian would have brought back Andy, Wells, Stanton (resign 2001), Mendoza, and Tino (resign2001). Brian Cashman is one of the Best GM's in the game. Only on better is Billy Beane.
