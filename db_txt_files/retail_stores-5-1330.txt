Macy's (was Rich's) has become my preferred department store now that I live in Atlanta. The store is similar (some say identical) to Belk's and Dillards (both common in North Carolina) in that Macy's has similar clothing (eg Polo/Ralph Lauren, Tommy Hilfiger, Nautica, etc), similar pricing (ie less than Saks, Bloomingdales and Nordstrom), and good and often sales. My biggest complain with Macy's, as with most department stores, is that it doesn't stock narrow size shoes.
