I own a 90 Celica GT-S, and absolutly love it. it dirves the best of all the sports cars i have driven, (99 mustang, 90 talon TSi, honda preludes(88 and 93), 92 Acura Integra(modified), and even a 98 mistsubishi Eclipse). i would never trade this car for anything other than a Celica, newer or older, its the name, performance, and reliability im after. its not the fastest car out there, but it is extremly under-rated.
