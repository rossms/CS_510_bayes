I recently attended a conference in Ponce Puerto Rico, while there I had the opportunity to test a few of their better rums. I must admit, Don Q Cristal is the best rum I have ever had. If you ask any of the locals what's the island's best rum, 99% of them will tell you Don Q Cristal. When you ask them about Bacardi, they will tell you that is what they export. If you ever get the chance, try a bit of Don Q, you will be glad you did.
