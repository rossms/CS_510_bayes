What a video! Several scenarios - boy at school, girl in bedroom, football player, cleaner, cook in a greasy spoon, boy in a restaurant. All 'singing' the song and when the momentum builds up, they really go for it, screaming the lyrics to someone else in the scene or into the camera. I really like this song and the video suits the mood well.
