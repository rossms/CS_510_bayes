* It is obvious now that not only is O'Neal a force who can make any team playoff worthy but that Miami is a title contender. * O'Neal is proving once again just how dominant he can be and how important the addition (or loss in the case of the Lakers) of one player can be. Miami is a contender this year for home court. To win it all? Perhaps not in his first year there but they are much better and the only thing they lack is enough court time together. By the start of the playoffs they should have enough of that to make serious noise.
