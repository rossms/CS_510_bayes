Love this state. People are friendly and there is so much to see. The lefties apparently don't like it, calling it backwards. I find the people very friendly and not preachy. You would expect a southern state that was founded by Christians to be Christian. I find that refreshing. Seems the lefties only want tollerance when it affects them, but are very intollerant themselves. Stay out of Virginia then. Leave it to us normal folks.
