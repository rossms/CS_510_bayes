Sorry, didn't like it. Actually I thought it a real bore. Don't bother with it. It fails because it's nothing new, and expects and big attention-span from it's audience. It's not a complete stinker, sometimes it's heart-felt, but generally it's pretty bad. Summary: A BORING, STUPID MOVIE THAT'S SOMETIMES HEART-FELT.
