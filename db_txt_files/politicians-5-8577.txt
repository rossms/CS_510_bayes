Ronald Wilson Reagan was the greatest President in our lifetime. I'm not going to go into specifics on his economic policies that revived our economy. And I'm not going to go into his role in winning the Cold War. I think the most significant thing that Ronald Wilson Reagan accomplished as President was to make us, as a nation, PROUD again. And that was something that my generation had never seen. God Bless that man.
