I like massachusets. Boston has this mix of blue collar white colar thing going on, and they two live fairly harmoniously in one city. The countryside in mass is great too, in fall that is always one of the coolets places to drive through. lol beloved, 114 degrees is comfortable? hmmmmmmmmmmm. Curious, unless you were in the southern hemisphere, you must have been lying about one of those temperatures. 114 vs 54? i dont think so, especaily not in august.
