hmmm.... lucky this year? They were a Top Ten team a couple of years ago as well. Sure Jameer Nelson is talented, but a better indication of a coach is how the team plays the game. What stands out about St. Joseph's is the consistency with which they play - their effort is always there, their defense is always there, and their ball movement is always there. To make a comparison, I would argue that Xavier was at least as talented as St. Joe's this year - and Chalmers may be as talented as Nelson. But Xavier lost 11 games this year. Why did Xavier lose 11, and St. Joe's 2? I'd say Phil Martelli.
