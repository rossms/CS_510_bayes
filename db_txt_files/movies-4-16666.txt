Too many flaws in the court case. Surely a ballistics expert would have been able to rather quickly determine the trajectory of the bullets and state wether any came from the crowd, but that is just one of the flaws. But all flaws aside, it makes one think about what we ask our men and women in uniform to do on a daily basis. We expect them to act with honor in the face of adversity, and at times that requires them to put their lives on the line for the sake of peace.
