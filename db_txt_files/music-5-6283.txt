Great straight ahead rock. This one really surprised. It has great modern elements like Spirits Rebellious but also some things that sound like Alice Cooper's early stuff. This guy is still the king of shock rock aftger thirty plus years and Marilyn Manson, Slipknot and others should bow their head. This guy did it first and still does it the best. Saw him live this year and he is still amazing.
