I have been to AE several times and i liekt he style of the clothes very much. They are nice looking but some of the shirts seem thin or cheap. I think that AE is a better to shop from than A&F because their prices are lower. I also think it is a decent store and that everyoen shoudl atleast try some clothes from there.
