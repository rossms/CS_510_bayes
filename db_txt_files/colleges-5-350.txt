Excellent course choice and content with plenty of supporting material and Tutors. It enabled me to change career, become self-disciplined and an astute business person that can identify problems and solutions effectively. I have met other MBAs from other schools whom don't seem to have the depth of knowledge nor application experience - quite a revelation. Heartily recommend it, and have very high regard for other OU students as it demonstrates commitment and determination.
