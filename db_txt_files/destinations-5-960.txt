Unfortunately, I've only been to London, but I must say, I truly enjoyed England! Most of the people were quite nice. LOADS of history and culture there. The English are not, however, known for their cooking, so (though I thought it was ok), you may want to avoid bangers and mash and whatnot. Things are also very expensive in London. Still, certain worth seeing. I hope to go again soon!
