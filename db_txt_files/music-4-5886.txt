It kind of sucks that this album became such a hit because of the song "Pour Some Sugar On Me", because that song really doesn't show their real talents as song writers. Its a shame that such a good band is condemned to be forever known for that song, when they should be recognized for songs like "Animal" and "Love Bites", which are my two favorite songs off of this album. Definitely their best one.
