No rules - just right. This slogan hits it, plus great service, great food, great values! A wide selection of stakes, delicious desserts and the best tasting bread in town! The salads are fresh with dressing down under, and while you are there you got to try the blooming onion. It melts in your mouth. My favorite place to eat!
