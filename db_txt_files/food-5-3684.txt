My second favorite (after samoas of course). These are great, rich and creamy with that added cookie crunch. They don't last too long in my house though. My little boys are huge Reeses Peanut Butter Cup fans and Tagalongs are one step about butter cups with that soft peanut butter and crunchy undercoating.
