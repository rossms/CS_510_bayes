Miles is THE BEST point guard in the nation. He is such a team leader. He may not make every single shot, but he makes them when the team needs them. Miles makes pretty much every play, steals the ball, is an AMAZING assist person, and he has greatly approved his offense this year. His threes have become almost automatic now. Besides all that, he is great at driving the ball, and is an all around great athlete.
