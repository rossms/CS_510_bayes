Looks like americans have a problem with your teeth, however it also shows how paranoid they about are about their looks. If you can give a cheesy grin and not give a damn what anyone thinks then you get 5 stars from me. Is this the kind of confidence that kept the French Spanish and Germans off your patch? I think it could be :)
