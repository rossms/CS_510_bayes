Bobby is the best, doest crack under pressure, most wins, good recruits, everybody that denies he's the best is just jealous, and im in nebraska country! FSU is a threat every year, when there are no off field problems, which he does enforce againdt, i.e. (s.minnis, r.moss, c.rix, a.mcpherson) This man won the nat'l championship at the age of 70, Paterno nor Osborne can top that!
