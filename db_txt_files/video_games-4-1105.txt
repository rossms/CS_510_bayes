Fun game , frustrating and not great if you're prone to migranes. A fun variation is Double Trouble (I may have invented it, but I don't honestly think that I was the first to think of it) . 2 players each control 2 of the 4 colors, preferably on opposite sides of the board. One is blue/yellow and the opponent is red/green (I think). Play as you normally would, but now, you have 2 color teams to control instead of 1...more challenging.
