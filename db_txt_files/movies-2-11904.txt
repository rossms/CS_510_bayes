Somewhere between a 2 and 3. Part of the reason that this movie was able to keep my attention for the full two hours is that Greg Kinear (sp?) is just a good actor, he can't help it - even when involved in a ridiculous script. There were a couple of funny scenes, and a couple of clever lines. I found the politically incorect theme with a 'heart of gold' message to be a little forumulaic, and a little too much like Shallow Hal, but this is not a terrible movie, and it will make you laugh a couple of times.
