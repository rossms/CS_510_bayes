Thank God we have Jim Tressel. He turned around the sunken ship left behind by Cooper, and created a high calibur defensive ball team, complete with gritty and hard hitting ballplayers. Any one who watched the National Championship Game will have seen what Tressel has brought to the table. The energy, and the effort that Cooper never had, and something we havent had since Woody Hayes. He's the best damn coach in the land.
