I've been to Nashville twice on business trips and havent spent a lot of Quality Time in the city, but what I saw and experienced of it I liked. I was surprised it was as big as it was and it has a lot going on. I expected a heavy dose of Country music influence and it's there, but it's OK. It's a city with a lot of life and seems like a step below Atlanta as far as a major Southern metropolis. Two things I liked about it are Goo Goo clusters and The Bat Building. Ask a local about the Bat building and look at it and you'll be humming the theme song to the old Batman TV show. Guarenteed !
