This is my personal favorite Beastie Boys video ever because it's like a cheesy 70's detective show, with Mike D as The Chief, MCA as Cochise, Ad Rock as The Rookie, and some huge black guy named Fred Kelley as Bunny. I don't really know what it's about, but it rocks cause everyone is either fighting or breaking doors, or chasing someone.
