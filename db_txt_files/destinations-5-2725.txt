Chicago isn't just a town, it's a way of thinking, acting, and feelings. It's a place where everything, even when it's dreadfully wrong, is right. Chicago seeps into your blood until it becomes family, belief, religion. It is the cool, beautiful lakefront parks and the cursed construction on the Kennedy. It is the culture and treasures of thousands of neighborhoods and fat-cat politics. Chicago is full alive of heart and soul.
