I noticed there are 2 versions of this product, a cool nestea in the can and 2 liter bottles, and the regular 16oz bottles of nestea..i am rating the latter..its the best iced tea on the market, better than snapple, and lipton brisk isnt even in the same league..its just sweet enough, with a refreshing taste of brewed tea..
