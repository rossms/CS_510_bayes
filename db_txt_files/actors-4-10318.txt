After seeing her in some films, i am getting to really respect the work she has done in such a short time. She was very good in Boys Don't Cry even though it is a hard movie to watch since is pretty graphic. I like her in Iron Jawed angels. I plan on seeing her in Million Dollar Baby. from the scenes I have seen she is very impressive. I have seen her in interviews and like her down to earth not the least bit full of herself attitude. Bravo to her for her second Oscar.One of our better current actresses I would give a 4.5.
