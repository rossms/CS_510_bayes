I give it a 5 even though it has turned into a communist dictatorship (a long time ago). Too bad it's run by the elite and not the people. I give it a five for what it should and could (and used to) be, not for what it is in its current form. The federal government has turned into a monster. It needs to be cut WAY down to size. I am basically taxed at gunpoint. Such a sad state of affairs. :(
