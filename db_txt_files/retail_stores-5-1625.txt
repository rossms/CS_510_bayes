I am giving Sears five stars because in my experience they have the best customer service of all of the department stores. Sears also has reasonable prices and decent selection. Also, probably the best place to buy good quality children's clothing. It is definately worth it to routinely haunt the children's section and look for the sales racks--designer teeshirts for 5 bucks etc.
