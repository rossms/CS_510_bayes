This novel was good because it goes into specific details of a black man trying to survive in a world of segregation. Ellison's style of writing is very vivid and detailed. Reading the protagonist's turmoil in life really forces the reader to feel sorry for this man. I gave it a 4 instead of a 5, because I have been impounded with novels by African Americans and though I feel for what they've gone through and they're amazing authors, I needed a new genre for a novel. All in all the book was brilliant and amusing.
