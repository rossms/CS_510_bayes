Recently tried the extra-long Philly Cheesesteak - paid over 8.00 for 2 long hotdog buns half-full of overcooked, greasy meat, with some cheese on it. I never saw any onions, and found only one green pepper on the whole thing. Looks nothing like the picture advertised, and so far, I havent found anyplace to complain. In this case, I want my money back!!!!!!
