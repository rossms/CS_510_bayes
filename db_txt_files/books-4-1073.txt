A classic cute kindergarten story. How often is it that you find stories about baby fruit bats (animals not widely considered to be cuddly and adorable?) I hold fond memories of it from kindergarten story time, and I think pepin909 stated things pretty well - unlike see Spot Run , it's actually got some value.
