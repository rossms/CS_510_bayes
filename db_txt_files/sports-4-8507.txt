Kobe is easy to hate. Personally, I can't stand the guy. But no one can hate on his skills. Best all around player in the game (sorry LeBron...you gotta wait a few more years). Explosive offensively, plays great defense. Though I can't give him 5 stars because great players are able to make good players better, and this year, Kobe has shown that he can't do that. Caron Butler & Lamar Odom aren't exactly mincemeat. They're good players. But despite the haters, Kobe has to be a top 5 player.
