GREATEST ATHELETE EVER. This isn't even arguable ONE SINGLE BIT. This guy would of been in the Hall of Fame alone just for his pitching ALONE. He played in the Dead Ball Era and probbobly would have a lot more Homeruns then Hank Aaron all time had if Babe Ruth had not of been a pitcher through a chunk of his career. He single handedly set the foundation of what is known as the greatest (yet most hated) dynasty in the MLB, the YANKEES. Babe Ruth is a LEGEND
