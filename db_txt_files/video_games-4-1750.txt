KoC is a fun, yet very simple empire/army builder. Fun for those who like the simple build an army and crush others battle system yet not much more to it. No realistic empire builder and a very simple merc system. Though it does get addictive fast it does get extremely tedious. Waiting for your next attack turn to build up, and the mercs to replenish, but still fun all the same.
