Incredibly, this game is even better than the prequel, Goldeneye 007. The similar gameplay with noticeably smoother graphics render just what fans were looking for in the sequel. The gender of the female star also shows equal opportunity and removes the label of only male gameplayers. The only downside to this game is that an extension pack is necessary to enjoy all facets of the game.
