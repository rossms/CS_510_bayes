I'm sorry, but I gave it more than one chance and I just haven't liked Krispy Kreme. The donuts are too sweet and they put too much glaze on them. The only thing I like about it is that you can get a free Krispy Kreme workers hat, and you can see the machines make donuts. My favorite donuts are cake donuts, but if I'm going to buy some from a donut shop, then I'll go to Ducan Donuts; much less sugary and alot less glaze.
