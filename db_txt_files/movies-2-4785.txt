Kinda dumb. Not exactly a revolutionary story. Michael J. Fox over-dramatized. A FAMILY It makes me sick just thinking about it. A little too retarded for any kid that's beginning to show some intelligence. I know it's a kids movie but it ain't exactly that great of a kids movie. Plot sucked, acting sucked, and most of the jokes were just dumb. A nice one for kids raging from 3 to 3.
