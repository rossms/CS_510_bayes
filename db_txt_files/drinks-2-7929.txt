I can remember my first encounter with OGD at a friend's house when I was about 14. His folks kept it around for what he said was medicinal purposes. It burned like hell going down. I recently had the unfortunate opportunity to re-visit OGD and guess what? It was just as nasty and burned like hell going down.
