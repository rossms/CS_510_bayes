I have been with Alltel since 2001 and I had a rocky beginning but I have been happy since my bill is almost always the same and Customer Service is pretty good. Service is great!! here in Small Town, NC. Sorry to hear so many of you have had bad experiences. By the way I do not work for Alltel I just like to support them because hopefully they will get better as they grow!!!:)
