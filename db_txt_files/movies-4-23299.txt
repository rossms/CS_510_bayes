I had mixed feelings the first couple of times I watched this. On one hand, I enjoyed seeing the crew again on the big screen, but the Borg plotline wasn't what I was used to in the Trek films. However, I have watched it several times since, and I like it more each time. What makes the movie for me is Alice Krige who plays the Borg Queen. She is flat out great in this role. I wish we could have seen more of her.
