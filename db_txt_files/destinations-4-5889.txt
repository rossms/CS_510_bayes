In Jersey the pros outweigh the cons. I've been through Trenton, Ft Lee and Vineland, but i've also been to Cape May, Princeton, and Morristown. Jersey earned a bad rap a few years ago and will never be able to shrug it off. Once you're off the Turnpike, you can find cheap liquor and gas too. (at least cheaper than PA or NY).
