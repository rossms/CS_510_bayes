Absolutely the most amazing site I have ever been to. The force of the falls hits the bottom so hard that you get soaked from the spray while standing at the top of the falls. The spray/mist combined with the glaring sun creeates dozens of huge rainbows all around you. If you have ever thought about going -- JUST DO IT!
