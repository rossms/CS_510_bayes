This is our family's third year to hold season passes. It has been the best year so far. First couple of weekends the staff and management were still working out the kinks. By the time the three-day July 4th weekend rolled around it was running smoothly. My husband and I went to the park every day for the holiday. The teens did too - just not with us! We've met some wonderful folks lounging around various areas of the waterpark. The colorful parade was nice but too short. The fireworks were awesome as we sipped our beers and toasted a remarkably fun weekend!
