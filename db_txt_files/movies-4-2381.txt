I thought that this movie lackd something, but I just cannot put my finger on it. I thought that Dwight Yoakem gave a very chilling performance. This film was very suspenseful and kept me on the edge of my seat from start to finish. Jodie Foster gave a great performance as usual. This movie was definately worth watching.
