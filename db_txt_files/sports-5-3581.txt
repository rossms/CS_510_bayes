The fact that Pete Rose isn't in the hall of fame, is one of the biggest injustices in sports history. He is one of the best hitters of all time and a fantastic player all around. Hall of famers should be judged solely on their baseball ability, and nothing else. Even so what he did really wasn't even that bad, so the man bet on some baseball games, its not like he ever rigged any games, as a matter of fact he never even bet against his own team. They should let him and Roger Maris in the hall of fame.
