Burger King has everything great except for thier french fries. They cook their burgers very well, I like mine either double cheeseburger or whopper JR. Their onion rings are the best, they are so crunchy and tasteful. Their french fries are extremly dry and tasteless though. You need to put lots of salt on them.
