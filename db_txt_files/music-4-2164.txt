I finally bought the Shins CD after having three different people whose opinion I respect about music recommend it. There are a couple of tracks on this CD that will blow you away - think a darker, dreamier Beach Boys... and it's a definitely worth a listen. It doesn't sound like anything you would hear on the radio. Update: New Slang may be the best track that I've heard in the last couple of years... worth the price of the album by itself.
