Tom Izzo has put together one of the best programs in the country at MSU. Even after losing the best leader in college basketball, Mateen Cleaves, the Spartans are still one of the top teams in the nation. Izzo is the primary reason for this. He seems to care for his kids and they would run through a wall for him. Look for them to advance deep in the tournament again this year and to remain a fixture in the tournament for years to come.
