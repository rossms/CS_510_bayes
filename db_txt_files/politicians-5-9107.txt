Clinton could have been THE greatest President but we shouldn't hold it against him that he was only great. Enforcing international law, providing international relief, ending welfare - a program that is debilitating both financially and spiritually, bringing down the debt, making college available to more kids, working for, and for the large part keeping, peace in Israel, Ireland, Korea, and Taiwan, protecting minorities. Clinton is a man of tremendous intellect and genuine heart. Thank you Bill!
