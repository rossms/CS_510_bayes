An excellent strategy game for a wide range of ages. I actually think I learned a few things from this game. Setting up your men and bombs before the game starts is 75% of the whole battle, so figuring out how to strategically place your resources is key, and those lessons can be applied to lots of other things. Don't mess with me at Stratego.
