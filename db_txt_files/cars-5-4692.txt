TOYOTA RULES!!!!! They ARE American made (Fremont, CA) will outlast, out perform , when it comes to off-roading, out-wheel any full-size Big 3 on the trails right off the showroom floor. I've been driving wheeling Toyota trucks since '84, so I think I can say this. Design ability = Toyota. Get your money's worth.
