Costs about $35 USD. Available at many US liquor stores, and online through www.caddellwilliams.com, among other places. From www.germain-robin.com: Wonderful Californian fruit overtones, with appealing floral aromas and a sensuous viscosity in the mouth. Much better than VSOP cognacs. and I couldn't agree more. Great taste, although not very mellow, which I suppose can be explained by its (lack of) age.
