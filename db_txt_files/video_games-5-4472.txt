A very fun game to play when passing the time. Once you start building the first few rides, coasters, and other attractions, prepare for the addiction of your life. This was my first PC game purchase and I still enjoy it at times. Don't forget to buy the expansion packs and the recently released Rollercoaster Tycoon 2 so you can continue the addicting fun of building amusement parks.
