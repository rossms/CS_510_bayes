At first I thought I did not see much of Irene Dunn and then I started going over the movie guide. I really liked her in Penny Serenade,as the woman looking back on her last decade with Cary Grants character and adopting a child. A real tearjerker of a movie. She was also good in I remember mama, and My Favorite Wife. She could handle both comedy and drama.
