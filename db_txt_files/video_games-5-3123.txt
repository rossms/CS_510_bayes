Some people refuse to buy the newest THPS game becuase they think it is the same as the one before. However; they are very wrong. TonyHawk 1 didn't give you the option of manuals, and you couldn't link those tricks together. The graphics jump alone make Tony Hawk 3 worth the money over Tony Hawk 2, but I'll tell you what....Tony Hawk was released on alot of platforms, and the difference from PS1 to PS2 was like an entire new game. For 20 bucks it's a really fun game....
