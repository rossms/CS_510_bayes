Depends on the location, but we've always had good pizza. The sauce is slightly sweet and nicely rich. Good amount of cheese. The cheese bread in the commercials looks great. Haven't tried the chicken tenders, but I think pizza places should stick to things with that bake and leave the fried things alone.
