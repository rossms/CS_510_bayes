I am proud to call myself a University of Minnesota student! The academics here, overall, are incredible, and I have had great experiences with all of my professors. The opportunities here are endless! I love the campus too...it looks like a private school tucked away in a huge city. I LOVE MINNEAPOLIS, as well! I can see the beautiful skyline from my dorm window! If you have ANY questions about the University of Minnesota, PLEASE e-mail me (vetorre2001@yahoo.com)!
