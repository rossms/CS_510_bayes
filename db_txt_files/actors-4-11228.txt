 She's perky, shes cute, shes popular to boot, she b*tchin, great hair the boys all love to stare, shes wanted shes hot, shes everything you're not. Well not quiet, she is a decent actress with a great personality, but the fact that she is above Meryl Streep worries me about this site and its authenticity.
