A very sweet film. No violence, no real sex to speak of, no dazzling special effects. A well written script with great performances all around, especially by Kate Hudson and Frances McDormand. This is a feel good movie for everyone, even if you didn't live through that era I think most can relate to the film in some aspect. I myself hate most of the music featured in the film but despite that fact I found it tolerable because I enjoyed the movie so much.
