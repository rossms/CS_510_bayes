Whether it's UM Football, World Cup Soccer, or High-School Athletics, this stadium may be a relic, but it still knows how to rock and roll. No Chardonnay sipping going on here - this is a stadium's stadium. The beer may be a bit flat, but you know what - you can still see and hear the action at the OB!
