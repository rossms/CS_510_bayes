I would like to say how pleased I was with the professional and friendly manner with which Two Small Men with Big Hearts (Toronto office) handled my move from Vancouver to Toronto. I would not hesitate to recommend them to my friends and co-workers. Thanks Two Small Men... you really do have Big Hearts. ' A very grateful customer.
