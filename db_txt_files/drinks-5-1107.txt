I cannot put my finger on exactly when or why it happened, but Corona has become the beer that I am most likely to drink when I am hitting the bars. I remember as a high-schooler mocking the trendy guys who drank this beer - it was cheap American beer or nothing for me. But over the years I have begun to appreciate its light flavor, its drinkability, and the fact that it doesn't wreak havoc on my stomach the next day. Amazingly, Corona is not in the top five beers in its home country - if you get to Mexico try in this order; Victoria, Indio, Negra Modelo, Bohemia, and Sol.
