We ate better than we've ever eaten when we were snowbound for four days February 2003, thanks to the frozen food now available at Trader Joe's. The shrimp stir fry gave us marvelous vegetables, the cioppino was heavenly, and the Asian rolls splendid. Since Swanson first introduced its frozen dinners we've need something else: cheap, healthy, and delicious frozen food in decend portions. I'll never be caught without a decent backlog of ready to heat food again, thanks to Trader Joe's.
