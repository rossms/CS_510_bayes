Pixy Stix brings back fond memories of my youth. The powdery substance may be a bit sour, but it is so much fun to play with that I was able to overlook everything else. My siblings I used to pour Pixy Stix in pop (I have no idea why we did that), but we thought it was cool. And me my buddies used to snort this stuff in study hall (once again, I am unsure why we did this). But it was all in good fun. How many other candies are that much fun to play with??
