So how many licks DOES it take to get to the center of a Tootsie Pop? Never quite figured that one out but I still love this lollipop more than any of the others. The best part is when you've licked away enough of the candy to be able to take your first bite of the tootsie pop. And did you know that some stores will still give you a free Tootsie Pop if you show them a wrapper with a star on it!?!
