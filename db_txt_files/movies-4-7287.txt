Here, you get to see what, in my mind, is one of the most-quoted comedies of all time. A classic, no doubt about it. Gunga-galunga. Tell the cook this is low-grade dog food. You'll get nothing and like it. Nananananananana (Chevy Chase on the putting green). Among plenty of others that are far funnier than I'm able to post here. A good reminder that Chevy was actually funny at some point in his career (in the era between this and Christmas Vacation).
