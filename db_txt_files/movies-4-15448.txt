This is one of my favorite books. Too bad the movie couldn't live up to the book. The movie completely eliminated one charector that I felt was central to the story and helps explains why Homer Wells gows up the way he does. I don't particulary agree with the message it preaches about abortion, but nonetheless, it is a pretty good movie, but without the charector Melony, it just lacks something to make it great.
