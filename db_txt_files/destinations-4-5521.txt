A very pretty state- Portland is a real nice and a vibrantly quirky city, as is Eugene. The Oregon coast is wonderful. I have driven the PCH from northern Ca. into Oregon- and its stunning. Crater Lake is out of this world, I also like Ashland and Corvallis. Many wineries in the Willamette valley. Mild climate (hardy fan palms are grown!-though lots of clouds and rain in the winter) many outdoor recreational possibilities.
