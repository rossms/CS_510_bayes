Very sweet, wholesome stories with fantastic illustrations. Beatrix Potter actually drew animals that were either her pets or that she saw when she went for a stroll in the countryside. This is a must for every child to read - so much so that I purchased the entire set and its in a lovely presentation box for my niece Freya, and she's only 10 months old.
