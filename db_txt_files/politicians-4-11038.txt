A real republican (unlike anti-choice zealots who claim the same) who is a bulldog that will take on anyone- I love a politician who isn't a party lapdog. Do I agree with everything he's done? No way. But he isn't afraid of dogma and will listen to both sides of the argument. . .something clearly lost on his contemporaries and more than a few voters.
