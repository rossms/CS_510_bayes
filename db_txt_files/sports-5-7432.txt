Just had to reply to dnice;s comment, not as good as freaking Kevin Johnson, and freaking Mark Price, your kidding me right. Mark Price, how many records does he hold? How many times did he lead his team to the finals, what about Kevin Johnson, did he retire with the Suns, and Gary Payton? When Gary Payton holds some records then you can talk. Muggsy Bogues was a better point guard than Mark Price
