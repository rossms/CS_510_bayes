jpdols - clearly your comment is daft (appropriately enough)as at least 3 people who posted before you did do listen to techno. Anyway, this is better than their debut, with more menorable tunes as opposed to grooves for the dancefloor. 'One more time' is the best known and most commercial track. Also probably the best.
