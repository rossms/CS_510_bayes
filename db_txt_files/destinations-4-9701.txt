I had quit smoking cigarettes. Then about 4 months ago, I caved in at a 7-11 and bought a pack of Marlboro No. 27 sitting right there at the checkout. Oh, man, what a rush. I'm a happy man again. Not sure what nutty taste of other reviews means but I suppose that's the description of the difference here. Nice European-smoke aftertaste. Camel Turkish Royal is similar but both are a little lower on nicotine than I want.
