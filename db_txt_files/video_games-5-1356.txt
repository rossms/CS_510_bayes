I bought this game not too long ago. I think its easy to understand and has great graphics. The same classy, popular Mario we all love in a better, newer system! Isn't that what the world was looking for. This game is definately a good one if you just got GBA. It also comes with Super Mario Classic. That game is actually pretty good considering its over 10 years old!! Bottom line....if your going to buy a game, buy this.
