I never thought of getting a Samuel Adams. It is just one of those beers that is good but I don't love it. I don't have any feelings towards it. This weekend I went to a party and was drinking the beer from the keg and was just really enjoying it. It was a light beer in the sense that it was lighter in color but it had this great flavor that made it almost like a Amber Ale. It was so good so after a few cups I asked what kind it was after having a guessing game which we guessed it might be Red Hook but was told it was Sam Adams. I was shocked. I now think that I would order one. I really enjoyed its taste.
