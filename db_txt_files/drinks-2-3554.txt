Requires a higly skilled bartender to make it right and only high quality liqours blend with ice tea. Also too strong of a tea can overpower the drink. If you want something complicated be prepared to have it vary widly based on the skill of the bartender. If it is made right though, it can be a real treat. I agree with the rating that said it is a dangerous drink. Many people (especially girls) don't relize that this drink can get you slammed after just a few. Personally, I stick with the Vodka gimlet or whiskey sour.
