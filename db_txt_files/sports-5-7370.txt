The best player of the mid-1990's when MJ was playing baseball. Hakeem was The Dream. He had quick feet of a guard and a feathery outside shot. ... I remember a regular season game against Patrick Ewing, Hakeem spun 360 and swished a 15-footer. Ewing could only watch in confusement. Hakeem was that quick. What he did to MVP David Robinson in the 1995 playoffs was legendary.
