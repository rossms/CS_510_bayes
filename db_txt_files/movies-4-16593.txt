This was a pretty good movie. Denzel Washington is great as the corrupt cop. It is hard to see Denzel play the bad Cop role. I can see why he won the oscar for this role. Ethan Hawke also did a nice job playing the honest policeman who thought he was being trained to be a narcotics officer. I do not usually like to rent movies with a lot of violence, but the plot was good and it was worth watching it for the actors.
