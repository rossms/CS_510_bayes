I really liked this novie. It came out when there was a barrage of Westerns being released. I think it was less hyped than the others and , in my opinion, the best one of that group to come out. Val Kilmer as Doc Holliday was a really good performance. Good storyline and a nice amount of action thrown in there to compliment that story. Jason Priestley is also in it - added bonus.
