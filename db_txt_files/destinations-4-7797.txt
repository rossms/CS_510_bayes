Definitely not the Walden Pond of the book, but it is definitely a peaceful retreat from the rest of the craziness. Great as a recreation area, and very quiet in the spring and fall. Also, if you're here, downtown Concord is worth a stroll around for some great shops. Pop over to Monument Square to the Colonial Inn for lunch.
