Yamaha XLT1200 is a well balance craft. Has good power, about 60 mph stock, with about $1500 in aftermarket parts allows it to hit 68 mph with 91 octane gas. Very stable hull in all weather conditions, decent storage space. My yami has 140 hrs on it and so far has been dependable with no breakdowns. Only negative comment about it is it sucks gas like you wouldn't believe, only takes an hour to go through a 15 gallon tank at W.O.T.
