What a life. You're a good looking guy who plays SS in the greatest city in the world for a team that has won the World Series three of the last four years. And, oh yeah, you're the best player on the team and have gotten better each year. What makes Jeter so special is that he is never satisfied with his play and works harder in the off-season than he does during the season. The interesting thing about him though is that with ARod and Nomar around, he may never start in an all-star game.
