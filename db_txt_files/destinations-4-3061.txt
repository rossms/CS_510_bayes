San Francisco may well be the best looking city in the United States - the hills are fantastic, the cable cars are historic, the fog coming in over the Golden Gate Bridge is stunning. But outside the scenery, there are some problems. The place is almost unaffordable for those who live there. The downtown street, Market, teems with homeless people who can't afford even basic needs in the city. And then, there's the earthquakes. If you're rich the city is great. If you're poor - or middle class in most other regions of the country - not so much.
