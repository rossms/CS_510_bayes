Not bad. Although I say that I prefer TECHNICS. However, I do believe that TECHNICS is an offbrand of PANASONIC. I find that TECHNICS are far superior, in most ways to any other portable CD player out there. I don't care what TECHNICS model you get... Nearly all of them are great. However if you can't afford the TECHNICS, this SL series by PANASONIC, is more than acceptable...
