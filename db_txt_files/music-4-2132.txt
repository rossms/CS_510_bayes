Not up to par with what they're capable of. A bit of a departure from what you'd expect, but that's not a bad thing.. the songs are more sober, the lyric progressions matured.. but it's just a little less fun than one would expect from the Ladies. Still.. it's a whole lot better than the other crap that's out there.
