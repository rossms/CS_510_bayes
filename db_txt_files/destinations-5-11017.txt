I have been to a lot of parks, but I really love this one. It is just as big as the six flags and great americas, ect. They just opened a new addition just for children that are under 4'. It is enormous too! I like it here cause they not only cater to the children, the adults get a thrill as well. It is a complete blast and I don't mind the crowds. It is all in fun!
