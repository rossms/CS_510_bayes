Come on. Give some credits here. It is simple YET it is just entertaining one. Fast pacing movie - no brains required - just relax and enjoy. Not STAR WARS or MATRIX, but definately above average. Average is something where you waste your time, but I perssonally think I didn't wasted it watching it 3 times in cinema and 2 times on home video.
