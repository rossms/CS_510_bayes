Hanson have matured nicely on their sophomore album, and have lost the cheesy school-time themes prevalent on Middle Of Nowhere. Their newest effort has lots of great hooks and memorable guest instrumentals, especially on the jangly Sure About It and the road tune Runaway Run. Only a few songs such as Can't Stop are a little too redundant, and the brothers still seem to have nothing but love on their minds, but genuine musicianship overshadows these weaknesses.
