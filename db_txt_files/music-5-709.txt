Actually, despite the mainstream success that this album experienced with all the trendy kids that wear Hilfinger and AE Fitch stuff, this album rocks. Lenny's funk influence shines throughout. I continue to keep this album in regular rotation. Some might say that he is overly concerned about image...who cares...the guy can back it up...he knows how to write great tunes...and he has proven this over and over again for 15+ years.
