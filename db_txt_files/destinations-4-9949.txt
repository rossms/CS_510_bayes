I like these...I hate the full flavors, but Camel Lights are a really really good light cigarette. If you are a ff smoker looking to switch down these may be a good bet, because they are almost as strong as marlboro reds...they are strong lights. Marlboro Light 100's are my reg. brand, but I will buy a pack of Camel Light 100's if I'm in the mood for something a little stronger.
