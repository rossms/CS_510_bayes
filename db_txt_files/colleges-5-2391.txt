175th on a list of 175, after clicking and clicking I was actually shocked to find my school, disappointedly so at the end of the list. Hopefully my rating will boost us above Southern Illinois. Northern Illinois is really a great place and a great value. I recieved a quality education and made lasting relationships. Too much attention is paid to the big name schools, so few have the opportunity to be there while so many are receiving just as valuable an experience at the smaller universities across the country.
