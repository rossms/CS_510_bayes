I really enjoyed this reef. I am a SCUBA diver and will be the first to admit that there better reefs but I have been there twice and was impressed with it both times. The reef offers all levels of diving and is relativly well perserved. The wall if the best feature of it though, be careful if you are unexperainced, 2 divers died the before I got there. In general it was a nice change of pace and provide divng that was relaxing. Very little current and great visability.
