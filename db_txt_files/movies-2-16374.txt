Good story that just does not quite pull it off. The acting is just somewhat so-so and the representation of the story line really leaves it hard for you to get into the movie. The whole pay-it-forward concept could have been played up more and the flash scenes they did use seemed disjointed and unresolved. Seems the producers view was to pull you more into the families life, but even that never really happens because you re not given enough plot to bite on. Over all I was disappointed even for a rental.
