Very peppy wagon at 180hp, great deal for the standard features. I have 2004 Canadian model which is 1000% better looking than the earlier models--sporty grill & black-backed headlights, standard spoiler, fog lights, headlight wipers, etc. If they made them this good looking intially they would have sold much better, before changing to the V50.
