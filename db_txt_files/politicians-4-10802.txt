Feingold consistently rates very highly for constituent service. Has built an independent image for himself in the Senate as someone who goes against the grain, but yet can get along well with his colleagues. He was originally elected in 1992 by beating a Republican incumbent. Since then, he was nearly defeated in 1998 and had a relatively close re-election in 2004. Much of that can be attributed to the fact that he doesn't collect "soft money" contributions from Political Action Committees, so he runs campaigns on the cheap. Feingold's very principled; that's what has sustained him throughout his career.
