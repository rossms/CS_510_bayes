Oh one of the best vacation spots of all time. The city sits under a volcano. The old buildings from the spainards are intresting, and they have tons of merchandise, color jewlery, rainsticks, beautiful tapestries, etc. sold for unbelievably low prices. Also, if your into stones, this place has a large variety of green jade, whole museums of it!
