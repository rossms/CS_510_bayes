Harriet the Spy was one of my favorite books as a child. Harriet is an 11 year old girl who loves to keep a journal and write down everything she sees. Some of the stuff she writes is not very nice. One day her journal comes up missing and she finds to her horror that her whole class has read the journal. Now they are all mad at her.and Harriet has to find a way to make things right. She also goes around town and makes observations of what she sees. Can be a funny book.and even a lesson of Be careful of what you say A good read.
