You know I'm not going to give Jordan 5 stars because the last half of his career, he got so many gift calls from refs, and so many people who were just intimidated into flatfootedness Jordan could just drive by them at leisure. It amazes me that people never learned how to play Jordan.. Just sag off him at 18-20 ft, and cheat over on his drives..If people had done that he would have been reduced to a 20-25 pt per game player rather than 30-35pts..
