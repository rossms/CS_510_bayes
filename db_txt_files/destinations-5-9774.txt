Kamel Red Lights are amazing I just have a hard time finding them at grocery stores but most gas stations have them. KRL's are the first cigarette I had tried and now I am still smoking them after 7 years and dont get me wrong I have tried some of my friends other brands of cigs and nothing compares. I will literally go to a different store if they dont carry them.
