Sandra Bullock usually plays an FBI agent or police cop on the job to stop something bad from happening. But, in Miss. C, she plays the same woman, only she spoofs it in everyway she can. She plays an FBI agent who has to dress up at a beauty pagent to stop an evil woman played by Candice Bergen from blowing up the crown, which has just been awarded to a goofy woman from Rhode Island. Funny, funny, funny movie.
