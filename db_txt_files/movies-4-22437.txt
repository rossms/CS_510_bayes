Had a very good plot for an action movie, it's just fun to watch, and it keeps you guessing. This could actually really happen, we colonize mars and some tycoon calims he owns the air and sells it to us at cheap prices. Of course there are plot holes. Why did aliens need a reactor that made oxygen. If they evolved on Mars, they should be able to breath that atmosphere. Why didn't Cohagen tell Rictor about his plan? But it's not logical, it's just fun.
