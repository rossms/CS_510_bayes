This team is awesome this year everything is in place and so far we're 13-0. Dirk is incredible. Nobody has ever seen a 7footer white guy put so many points on the board. Nash is also awesome. He's got the speed and the skills. Finley, what can't you say about his skills. He's the big playmaker when the game is on the line. Mavericks all the way, screw LA.
