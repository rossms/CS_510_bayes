Thorough sampling of Duran Duran's work. Includes early to mid-eighties hits Rio, View to a Kill up to their refined nineties selections like Come Undone. It's all the casual fan will ever need. With a vast pool of hits to choose from, there is little filler and it seems to have included all the songs for which a listener can familiarize himself with the band.
