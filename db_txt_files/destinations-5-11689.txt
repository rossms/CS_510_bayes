If you are flying into South Padre Island for spring break, make for sure you stay on the SOUTH end of the island (Saida or Gulfview). If you are driving, stay on the North End for a nicer condo at a better rate (Inverness or Galleon Bay). Also....we have a package there to avoid being the average chump waiting in line for 30 minutes at night. As far as minors go, paricularly be careful drinking on the beach.
