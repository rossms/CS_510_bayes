Not only is he a phenominal hitter (and a better catcher than most people give him credit for), but he embodies sportsmanship. His reactions to all the hoopla surrounding him should be an example to baseball players everywhere! Players like him make me remember why I started loving this sport so much in the first place - and THAT'S what it should be about.
