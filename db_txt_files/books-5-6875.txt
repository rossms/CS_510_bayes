What an incredible series so far, easily one of my favourites. The characters are so indepth, so endearing, so *real*. Mr. Martin's story has had me both laughing and in tears, has made my heart pound with excitement and fear, and has kept me up long past my bedtime to feed the addiction his work has created. My only complaint is the amount of time between books. It seems to take forever for a new installment, but I suppose perfection is worth the wait.
