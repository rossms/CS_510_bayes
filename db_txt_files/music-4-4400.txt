This is a solid effort by rock legend Ted Nugetn. All of the songs are familiar to most rock fans. However, it is the excellent guitar work that makes this a must have. Nugent's problem is that he has struggled writing a good three minute single. His best work is when he is rocking out on the guitar. This is an excellent example and a fun ride. I recommend this one.
