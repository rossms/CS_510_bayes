One of the more fun videos out there and creative. It parodies such great chilhood films from the 80s and early 90s like Karate Kid, Ghost Busters, Willy Wonka and the Chocolate factory and Edward Scissorhands. These are some of my favorite films that the band parodies and they do a hilarious job. This video is packed with more good energy and happy vibes than anything I have seen in months. Colorful, funny and cute as can be, Movies the best video currently in rotation
