Not a lot of people are familiar with the name but you'll know him if you see him. He was always those character actors but he never took his projects for granted. He was a true actor with lead man caliber who always took supporting roles. His swan song was his best acting project of his career -- The Straight Story. Watch it, it's really good. What a shame that he had to kill himself because of his terminal cancer. How sad!
