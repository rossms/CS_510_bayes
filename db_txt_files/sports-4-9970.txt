Clearly the Trail Blazers are loaded with talent. But just as clearly they're unable to create a team that is as impressive as the sum of its individual parts. What's missing? For LA, it was the right coach. For the Trail Blazers, I think it's a clear leader. Pippen just doesn't have the personality. Wallace is too much of a loose cannon. Smith is too mellow. And Stoudamire doesn't seem to be stepping up to the job. Maybe the right coach could figure out a way to get this team to play up to its potential. But I have a feeling the chemistry just isn't there with the current group of players.
