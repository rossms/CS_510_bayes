After reading some of the other reviews, I would have to agree that it all depends on the agent. Like most people, I've spent most of my adult life paying for insurance, but never actually needing it. About a month ago, I needed it. I was in a car accident, and while my injuries were minor, my car (not payed for yet) was totalled. This happened on a Friday, and by Wednesday the totalled car was payed off, with a check for the remaining money at my agents office, more than enough to cover the down payment on a new car. I thought they did a great job and handeled things quickly, all things considered.
