For whatever reason, North Carolina can't build and maintain a good football program. Historically, the school ranked just behind Clemson (and perhaps Maryland and Georgia Tech, which joined the conference in the early 1980s) in the Atlantic Coast Conference. The team recruits competitive talent (especially on defense, running back, and offensive line) and has excellent facilities (ie Kenan Stadium). Nevertheless, something is missing, including top talent at the key positions of quarterback and wide receiver (presently and historically).
