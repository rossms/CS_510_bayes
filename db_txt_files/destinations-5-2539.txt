Kauai has definitely made it's way into my heart. It has become one of my favorite places that I have ever been. We saw whales, turtles, birds, surfers...etc. So amazing. If you go there, make sure to see spouting horn. We saw it in pouring rain and it was awesome - shot almost 20 feet into the air!
