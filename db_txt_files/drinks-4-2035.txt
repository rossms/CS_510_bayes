As I said in my review of Inko's Original white tea, I think it already tastes a bit like honeydew melon. So, I guess the two naturally go together. Anyhow, the result is a light, clean flavor that's actually quite sweet, without being syrupy. Unlike some white tea drinks - and contrary to my expectations - this actually isn't too watery. Further sweetened with fructose crystals (they're careful to point out that this isn't the same as high-fructose corn syrup), a 16 oz bottle has 56 calories.
