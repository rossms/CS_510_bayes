Christianity neither is, nor ever was a part of the common law. -Thomas Jefferson, letter to Dr. Thomas Cooper, February 10, 1814 Just one of many quotes of Jefferson indicating that the ten commandments had nothing to do with the constitution. You have to be both brain damaged and ignorant to believe Jefferson was a Xian, he was, at best, a diest, who flatly rejected all attempts to impose Xianity into govt. I encourage people to do their own research on this.
