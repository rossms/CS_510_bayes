Nowhere near as tastey as Canada Dry Ginger Ale. Schweppes Ginger Ale is like Pepsi to Coke or Burger King to McDonalds, a knock off that is just never able to overtake the original in flavor, and recognition. In fact I probably couldn't even say exactly what it was that is lacking in Schweppes, it's not any one thing in particular, but I know easily which one is better.
