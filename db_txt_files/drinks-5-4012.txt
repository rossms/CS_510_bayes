Anyone who loves rum knows this is the best Rum their is. Especially if you are from Puerto Rico. Just FYI, if you go to Puerto Rico and you ask for Bacardi, even though it is Puerto Rican Rum also, they will know you are a tourist. Only tourists drink Bacardi. Don Q makes so much money everywhere else, that they don't bother with the U.S. Market that Bacardi has. Once you taste it, you'll know. No after taste and no hangover the next day.
