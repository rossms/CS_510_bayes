137,000 on it and still runs strong. I have the quad 4 engine and 3-speed auto tranny. I had to replace the on /off light switch at 125k and needed new rotors at 95k. I still have the origional back break drums. I put like 6 sets of front break pads on it over the years. I also towed a U-Haul trailer from Maimi once and towed my boat like 100 times with it and had no Major problems. Minor problem now is the door locks dont work right.
