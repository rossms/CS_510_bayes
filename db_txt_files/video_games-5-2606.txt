The best fighting game you can get : The character are good, the graphics are awesome, A LOT if moves, and realistic ones as well (maybe two or three are a bit magical but nothenig like the throwing sculls or fireballs in MK), Awesome throws. The fights are beatiful, even if none of the players are good (in opposition to Dead or Alive, in which fights only get interesting when you are one of the best player around). The only negative points is the repetition of characters (Ziekfried and Nightmare, Kilik and Seung Mina, Hwang and Xianghua, Rock and Astaroth, Sophitia and Lizardman) and the lack of story.
