I don't like Holly Hunter. I find almost everything about her annoying, but it's probably her accent that bothers me the most. In Broadcast News, for example, she had this very strange, grating Southern accent. I found it hard to listen to what she was saying because her accent was so distracting. What's the deal with that? The only reason I didn't give her a 1 is because she has been in some pretty good movies.
