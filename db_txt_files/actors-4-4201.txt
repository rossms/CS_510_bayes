I liked him in. Moulin Rouge, Little Voice, and he was good in Down with Love. Did not watch a lot of the Star war episode I but he seemed to be good in that too. He has a charm to him and he show some versatality in his talent going from an action hero to a shy pigeon man in Litttle Voice to singing in a musical..
