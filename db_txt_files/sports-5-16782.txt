Ahman Green could have done better on yards per cary he had 100 or so yards bur and a tree and a half average. Thats not the Ahman Green I am used to seeing. Brett Farve did great! Micheal Hawthorn had many chances to be the Superstar of the night with the missed interncetion and TWO missed sacks. But overall I am very impressed with the passing offence and I felt the defence could have steped it up. BUT A GREAT WIN.
