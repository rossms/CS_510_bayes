An enjoyable album throughout and an improvement over Moby's aimless Everything is Wrong album. The tracks often have a strong beat behind them, but are often too simplistic. Even so, Play is an original album because of it's combination of soul samples and dancefloor grooves. Porcelain is a particularly emotional, powerful piece of music. Other recommended tracks include: South Side , Natural Blues , and My Weakness .
