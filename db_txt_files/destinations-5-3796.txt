Poor Abba5 obviously knows NOTHING about Vanderbilt. I've lived here for ten years and have found it to be a beautiful place filled with talented, intelligent and friendly people. Great resturants, cultural attractions, beautiful neighborhoods, old money, decent values, great sports (football, hockey, baseball)and some pretty decent shopping too. Traffic and construction are a pain but that's the price we pay (now) for improved roads (later). Think I'll stay around.
