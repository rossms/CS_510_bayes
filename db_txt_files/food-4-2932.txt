Pepperidge Farm Milanos are pretty good, but I definitely prefer Mint Milanos. A Mint Milano features two light, airy cookies sandwiching layers of rich chocolate and light mint flavor. The cookie has a crisp texture, and it's not too sweet. As a result, Mint Milanos are highly addictive. If I have a bag of them in the house, I have to restrict myself to only two cookies per day. Otherwise, I'd inhale them all in an instant!
