This CD is very uneven. Some of the songs are good, but some of them are really irritating. I guess it's like most of Sting's post-Police CDs (with the exception of Nothing Like the Sun - I really liked everything on that one). So if you're a Sting fan, you know what you're getting yourself into. But if you're not - be prepared that Brand New Day is a high-maintenance CD, meaning that you can't just put it in the CD player, sit back, and listen to the whole thing. You'll need to repeatedly skip the annoying songs so you can jump right to the good ones.
