I love this video especially cuz it reminds me of the eighties and when I was in eigth grade on a school camping trip and we were blasting it on the stereo thinking we were being rebellious. To this day, he is my hero-he has one of the most amazing voices and is always singing with such great passion, being highly influenced by Freddie Mercury. I love this song-esp. talk me no bible just look in my eyes.
