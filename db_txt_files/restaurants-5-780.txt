I have wonderful childhood memories of stopping by the Dairy Queen on summer evenings for dessert. Deciding what to order was always a very serious event, usually requiring several in-depth discussions about the seemingly endless list of choices. As a child, I stuck with fairly tame items- Mr. Misty Slushes, Dilly Bars, and the occasional dipped cone. As I got older, though, I found myself shifting towards the hardcore treats- Buster Bars, Peanut Buster Parfaits, and Blizzards. Now I don't think it's summer until I make a least one stop by the Dairy Queen for something really decadent.
