One of the highlights of my trip to Spain. Absolutely beautiful! Fantastic architecture, Cathedrals, streets everything. We were there during Semana Santa which was even more exciting because of all the processions slowly winding their way through the streets. Thousands of people dressed in hoods and robes carrying 4 foot candles, religious idols etc. Truely a memorable sight.
