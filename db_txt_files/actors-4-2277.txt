hamlet was his best role! he was miscast in braveheart b/c of the age factor.. he should've stayed behind the camera. i think he's a gifted director. the passion was brilliant, but it really really really inflated his bankbook and i'm sure his ego. my husband thinks he is cool & i think he's chosen better roles as he matured. i didn't like him one bit back in the 80s era and didn't think he was cute, but i sure do now!
