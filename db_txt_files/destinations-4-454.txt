We visited Tortola a few years back, ever since that time, my wife has wanted to return. It's not at all a touristy type of place at all, the people are really receptive to visitors and the island is chalk full of natural beauty. The snorkeling is great and the beaches aren't bad either. It's worth noting that being that this is a British Virgin Island, the monetary system is based on the British Pound, which is more valuable then the US dollar, so it's a little more expensive then some of the other destinations in the Caribbean.
