Talk about lucky. his career was dead in the water until he got the role in Pulp Fiction. Now he's one of the hottest actors around, getting tons of work in a variety of movie types. He's done some good stuff ( Get Shorty) and his share of bad ones ( Battlefield Earth). He's here to stay though and I really dont have that much of a problem with that. Mr. Comeback has a beautiful wife ( Kelly Preston) as well. That's good for a One Star bump up.
