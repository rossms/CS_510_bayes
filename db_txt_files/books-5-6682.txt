The Hobbit will always be #1 in my heart. When I was a little kid I use to tell people that when I grow up I wanted to be a hobbit. Bilbo is one of the bravest characters ever. He leaves his comfortable home and ends up on the other end of Middle Earth at the Lonely Mountain where the evil dragon Smaug lives. Don't let me forget the slimey bugged eyed creature named Gollum.
