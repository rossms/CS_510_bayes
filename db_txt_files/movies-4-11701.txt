I liked this installment of the raunchy teen comedy trilogy. There were plenty of laughs courtesy of our favorite loud-mouthed jerk, Stifler (Seann William-Scott). And of course there were the sweet heartfelt moments between Jim (Jason Biggs) and his dad (Eugene Levy). I didn t really miss the other characters who decided not to do this film. Overall, it was an enjoyable movie. If you liked the other Pie films, you ll probably like this one too.
