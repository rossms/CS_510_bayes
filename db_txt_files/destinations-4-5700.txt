I have been to 47 states and it is one of the nicest in people and interest. They are smart and the women are good looking. I even married a farm girl from there (I am from NYC and live on the water). There is plenty in the state to see and do but you just have to calm down, relax and understand the people. Could work on their variety of people and foods.
