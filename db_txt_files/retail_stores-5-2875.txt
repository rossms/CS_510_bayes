I'VE BEEN SHOPPING AT WHITEHALL SINCE I WAS 17YRS OLD. I ABSOLUTELY LOVE THEM. I PURCHASE MY FIRST PIECE OF DIAMOND FROM WHITEHALL, AND I WILL NEVER GO TO ANY OTHER STORE TO PURCHASE MY JEWELERY. IT WAS EXTRA SPECIAL FOR ME WHEN I GOT ENGAGED AND REALIZED THAT MY RING WAS FROM WHITEHALL. WHEN I GAVE BIRTH TO MY DAYGHTER HER FIRST PAIR OF EARINGS WAS ALSO FROM WHITEHALL. ALL MY FAMILY MEMBERS HAVE THEIR ACCOUNTS WITH WHITEHALL. I LOVE WHITEHALL THE STAFF ARE EXCELLENT. I WOULD RECOMMEND WHITEHALL TO EVERYONE.
