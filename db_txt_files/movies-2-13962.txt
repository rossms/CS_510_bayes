Taxi Driver was a disturbing movie to say the least. I remember, young as I was when I watched it, I was very shocked when he said he always had to clean up the back of his seat. I thought it was overall a movie of very bad taste, that did not, could not influence the audience in a positive way. In fact, Ronald Reagan was shot because of this stupid movie and the madness it arose in people.
