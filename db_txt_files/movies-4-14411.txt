Powerfulpinky got it right. This movie is timeless. If it's shown to teenagers 100 years from now, they will probably identify with the same type of conflicts and problems. It's an excellent movie, with strong characters and a good storyline that flows well, even though the setting is basically the same throughout the whole film. I really enjoyed this movie, but found it just a bit unrealistic how at the end, completely opposite characters got attracted to each other in such a way.
