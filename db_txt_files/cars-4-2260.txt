This is one of the best looking cars ever made. One of the greatest cars for the money. Very good upgrade potential. Very fast. One car beat the Z in every category listed above, especially drop dead gorgeous work of god looks: the 1993-1998 mkiv Toyota Supra. The greatest car ever made. Nothing can touch it. If it weren't for the Supra, I'd be getting a Z. -solrac- soon 2 b mkiv tt 6 spd
