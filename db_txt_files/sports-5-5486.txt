It is funny when people leave comments like he sucks, and give a player one star just because they are fans of a rival team. While at UK, Keith Bogans earned honors such as: All-American, SEC Player of the year, and SEC Tournament MVP. He is UK's all time leading scorer among guards and the fourth all time leading scorer at any position. He also started 36 games his rookie season in the NBA. Wouldn't that at least amount to two stars?
