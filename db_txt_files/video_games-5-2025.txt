I've always been a Zelda fan and I always will be. It's Zelda in 3D and a great conversion. Just as Zelda 3 did for Super Nintendo, Zelda 64 does for Nintendo 64. People bought an N64 for this game and so did I. The graphics and story are great, except for a glitch here and there(N64's fault), Zelda is fun!
