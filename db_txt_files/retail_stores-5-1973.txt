I like best buy, I think they have really good priced items and it is always fun going their just to look even if you don't buy anything. They have alot of the newest hottest stuff on the market. Anything electronic you need they usually have, and their customer service reps are always ready to help you without you being forced to buy something. They will ask you if you need help with anything or if you have any questions to let them know. I think Best Buy is one of the very best electronic stores.
