I'm giving them four stars because they were much better last year...they had Pankow touring with them, and we got to hear You're Not Alone, Questions 67 68, Baby What A Big Surprise, Will You Still Love Me, and A Hit By Varese, all of which are absent in this years' set list. That being said, they deserve some serious consideration if they are coming to your town. Accept a ton of hits, played with precision, skill, and utmost consistency (and some passion thrown in, when Bill Champlin is singing)!
