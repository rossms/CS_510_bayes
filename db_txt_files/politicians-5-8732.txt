No one died with Clinton lied. So he was impeached for lying about his personal life-- we shouldn't be diving in to that anyway; not as long as it doesn't affect his ability to lead the country. His ability to lead the country, by the way, was quite effective. Especially compared to the current "leadership". Actually worked towards paying off the deficit, created jobs, and gave tax breaks to EVERYONE-- not just the rich. If foreplay and lying about foreplay is the worst thing he's guilty of, he's one of the cleanest politicians in all of history.
