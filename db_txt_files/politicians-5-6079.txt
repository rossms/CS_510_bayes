John Ashcroft stands above other politicians in that he is not afraid to stand up for what he believes in before consulting the special interest groups . STanding up for the rights of an unborn child takes a lot in today's world where the backasswards people who fight against going after a murderer like Hussein are the same ones who will taken and have taken the life of any innocent unborn child without thinking twice about it! I guess birds of a feather do flock together! I am thankful people like John Ascroft aren't part of the flock!
