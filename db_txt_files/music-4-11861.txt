The Offspring is a really, really awesome Pop-Punk band and i really like them. This album is a little bit poorly-done, in my opinion. I mean Want You Bad is like the most rad song ever, but some of the songs just suck. The Offspring is capable of really cool songs, but this album is somewhat un-fulfilling, but I'm sure the next album will bounce back. Overall, I like Conspiracy of One, but I would really only recommend it to hardcore Offspring fans, not all the people who bought Americana.
