I would like to say that bill is not only one of the best ball players of all time he is all so a great friend. I first started doing public autograph sginings with bill in 98 and of all the football stars I have worked with, bill is by far the most fan acomadating. The only others that come close are Terry Bradshaw and Steve Owens (also and sooner).
