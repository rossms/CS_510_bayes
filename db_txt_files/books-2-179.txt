Dave Pelzer...regardless of his past, is an arrogant right-wing phony who hides behind a stucco wall and a rent-a-cop in a million dollar sh*t-home right off of Highway 111 in Rancho Mirage, California. He and his wife have 4 autos (matching Hummers, as well as her Jaguar and his Lotus). He frequents Sullivans Steakhouse (without his wife) in Palm Desert and tries to act cool, buying drinks for the ladies, smoking cheap cigars, and spewing his know-it-all-psycho-babble, doing impersonations and quoting celebrities and Presidents. Most people just consider him creepy. I consider him an a**hole.
