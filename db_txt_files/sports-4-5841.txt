First of all his name is spelled KELVIN, and I don't know what exactly would make one a fake basketball player, but Torbert is in fact an extremely athletic and strong small forward. The only reasons he might not be a solid NBA player in the future is because of his somewhat limited range and inconsistant jumpshot.
