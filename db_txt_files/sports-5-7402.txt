I had the good fortune of seeing him play at LSU and with the N.O. Jazz. I only wish that he had come along 10 years later when they had a shot clock and 3 pointers. In his last NBA year they added 3 pointers and he hit 10 of 15. He would have had MONSTER numbers with both. He also would never have been called showboat or hot dog as he was in his career. My two favorite memories were a no-look half-court hook shot at the buzzer that he drained, and a no-look, behind-the-back, between-a-defender's-legs bounce pass to a teammate. My favorite player of all time, and sorely missed.
