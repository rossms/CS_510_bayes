The best president we've ever had. You don't see current politicians standing behind a clear ideology, they're all a bunch of moderates who just try and get votes. By showing that he was a moral and ideological man, Reagan was the most conservative president but gained the largest electoral and popular triumph of any president. Ironic isn't it?
