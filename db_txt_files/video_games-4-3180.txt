Splinter Cell is probably the first Tom Clancy game i have like in my whole life, as i like it for many reasons firstly its the only real stealthy game on the PS2 and all of the cool gadgets you can get. [as you get further on in the game the gadgets get even better i wont spoil it for you by telling you them all]Also i liked Sam Fischer as the main character as he added a bit for professionalism to the game saying he is a bit older than other heroes.
