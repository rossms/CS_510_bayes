Chan has overcome incredible adversity - such as losing 11 good players on a team (that already was not very deep and didn't have a quarterback) in his second season - to take his team to bowl games in each of his three years. Now, in his fourth season out of a five year rebuild, he has the team poised to be very good - even against a daunting schedule. I don't think anyone, anywhere could do any better under the circumstances.
