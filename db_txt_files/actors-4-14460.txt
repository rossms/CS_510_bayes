*Standing ovation* Bravo, Computergal! You sure told me, didn't you? Thanks for showing me the light. Apparently I was wrong. Here I thought that devil worshippers were supposed to be really mean and evil people.But you sure said it.....you don't know much about her, and you sure as heck don't know anything about me. As I said before...I don't care who Rose McGowan dated.Because I don't get weird over who some celebrity was with ( a long time ago)....yawn.
