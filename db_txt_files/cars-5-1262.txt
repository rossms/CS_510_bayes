Best car I've owned to date. It's a burgundy 1996 Avalon XLS loaded with every available option (leather, moonroof, etc.) and a smooth, powerful V6 that runs very good despite that it has 167K miles on it. I'm very pleased with this car and if you test drive one you will buy it. It's that nice. People often say this car is built for older people, but I can tell you I'm only 25 and love my Avalon!
