Kidd has become a rotisserie basketaball tour de force - not to mention a top NBA point guard. This guy really fills up a stat sheet - he boards, scores, gets steals, hits the occasional 3, blocks a couple shots, and is becoming a more consistent scorer. I was impressed with how well he was able to come off his injury to make an impact in the playoffs. Can't say I like the new doo though.
