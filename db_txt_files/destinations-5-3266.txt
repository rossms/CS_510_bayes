What an awesome city. It's very green due to all the rain fall. I enjoyed the food, the cheap housing, the great public school systems and the cleanliness of the city. People also tend to drive with courtesy, as opposed to other cities I've been to. The downside....traffic and to a point government issues. But all in all...a five-star city!
