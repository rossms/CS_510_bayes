Billy Christal, John Cusack, and Catherine Zeta Jones did a really good job in this not really good movie. Julia Robert's once again kill's any hope for this movie doing good. It seems' to me she tries to hard to play her roles. She is an over kill and that hurt's everyone that does movies with her. Julia go break up another husband and wife and stay away from making movies!!!
