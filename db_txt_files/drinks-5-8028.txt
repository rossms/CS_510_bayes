Ancient Age might just darn well be the best kept secret in whiskee sense 10 High !!! My brother law and i finished a whole goddam 1.75 in a night and we didn't even puke. No hangover the next day neither. Don't break the bank on that snob juice they call whiskie! It costs too much and makes ya puke. Ancient Age whisky or nothin at all.
