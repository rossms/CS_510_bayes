I visited the campus in Tuscaloosa just yesterday. What an eye-opening experience! I had never been there, and was astonished to see how large the campus is. They even have multi-level parking, which only costs a dollar. The students impressed me. They seemed generally upbeat & well-adjusted, and so many of them wore shirts with the school name on them. For years, I had some misconceptions about the University of Alabama. Now I'm glad to see that I was mistaken.
