It looks extremely beautiful and there seems to be a lot of good wildlife there. But the cold winters don't seem that good. But what makes this place a bit more special is I have friends there. I would love to visit this place, but I don't know if I want to love there. It seems a bit too small for my liking. It is almost compared with Tasmania in Australia. Tasmania is a small island full of forest and beautiful landscape, and Hobart (it's capital city) is very small. Tasmania is also a cold place.
