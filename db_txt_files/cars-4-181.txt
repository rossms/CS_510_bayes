good power for something its size, keeps up with most open class machines in the woods. handles decent. easy to power slide, 4 wheel works great i havent gotten stuck yet and ive been thru some pretty bad stuff. i just dont like how much noise the belt makes, gettin an EPI kit, bear claws, and a quadworks stage 1 kit. should be able to keep up with the big bores when its time to play. :) all in all, i love it. comfy, stable, strong, everything is where u would expect it to be. almost perfect. and definately the best in its class.
