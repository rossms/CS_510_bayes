Not a good beer but not the worst. On par with bud and miller. We drank a lot of the Genny pounders when we were in college. Cheap beer in a big bottle is hard to pass up when you're 21. The scary thought is that the water for the beer (supposedly) comes from the Genesee river. If you know it then you know how scary that could be.
