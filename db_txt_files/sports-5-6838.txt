I know that Joe is all business. He has been since I met him in junior high school in 1976. Always friendly, personal and no-nonsense, even as a teenager. We knew he'd go far, but despite that, he's still achieved greatness in all that he has done far above our (classmates) expectations. Just because he doesn't dye his hair different colors or like alot of publicity or "fireworks", Joe will succeed in anything that he does--you can trust him and count on him.
