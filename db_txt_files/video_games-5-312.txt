Wow! That's what I thought when I played riven - it is so beautifully made and puts you in a really good mood. That is, if you aren't stuck with any of the puzzles.. Some of them are really difficult, but not unsolvable. It's worth buying just for the wonderful world they've created! You will need quite a lot of time to play though...
