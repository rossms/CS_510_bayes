I have to say that I am surprised at some of the comments here. Over the years I have patronized a half dozen (or more) B&N stores in CO, CA, TN and WA w/o ever having a bad service experience. I have asked for books which were out of stock several times and always been able to special order anything still in print. Plus, it is one of my favorite Christmas and gift stores (atmosphere seems calm even at Christmas). The cafe? Glad they have it but I HATE STARBUCKS coffee.
