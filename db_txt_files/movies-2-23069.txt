I wanted to believe this was a great movie so badly, that I deluded myself after seeing it the first time. I actually trained my brain to drown out Jar Jar's babble, and young Anikan's cheesy pickup lines. I concentrated on the special effects. I convinced myself that bad acting was good acting, but I could only hold up the charade for so long. The act finally came to an end when I saw it a second time. My eyes were opened. George Lucas isn't infalable. This isn't a good movie!
