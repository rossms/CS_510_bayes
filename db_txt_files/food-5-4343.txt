I love the new chili cheese fritos- they taste like doritos USED to! Dip em in plain sour cream, because the flavor can be rather intense at times, and doesn't need much else. Always thought plain fritos were good for dipping, but plain- they are too plain. Also if you take plain and use corn relish with them... it is delicious too!
