The Maxima is Nissan's best made vehicle. Its a full size car that offers a powerful V6, and with options can be turned into an entry level luxury sedan. All Maxima's, new and used, are a smart buy. Resale values are high and reliability has always been excellent. Recommended, but also look at the Avalon.
