This should be at the top of the list, as far as Porsche is concerned. This bat out of hell was designed with complete maniacs, like myself, in mind; no air, radio, or other unnecessary weight - nothing but seats, a steering wheel, and about 462 horses under the hood. I finally got to see one of these in person at the Auto Show a few weeks ago, and F*@K!!!, what an evil looking work of art, indeed. This car is an all-business machine, ideal for anyone insane enough to find the 911 Turbo a bit lacking.
