YANKEES RULE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! THE BEST TEAM IN THE MLB. THE RED SOX AND THE METS SUCK. YOU RED SOX FANS ARE JUST JEALOUS BECAUSE WE WON 26 WORLD SERIES TITLES. JETER ROCKS. A-ROD IS GREAT. ADMIT IT RED SOX AND METS FANS, YOU ARE ALL AFRAID OF THE NEW YORK YANKEES. JUST ABOUT EVERYONE IN MY FAMILY IS A YANKEE FAN. CALL THEM EVIL ALL YOU WANT. DARTH VADER I MEAN THE YANKEES RULED THE MLB BEFORE THE SOX AND THE METS EVEN TOOK THE FIELD. THE CURSE MAYBE BE BROKEN BUT WHEN THE RED SOX FAIL TO WIN THE WORLD SERIES, THE CURSE WILL BE REBORN. STRIKE 3 YOU'RE OUT RED SOX AND METS.
