Gary Williams built Maryland from NCAA sanctions and a 2-14 ACC record--to one of the premiere programs in America. Hes also sent 27 players to the NBA--and has as many current NBA players--at 8, as does Chefsky. Only Coach K reached that total with 33 Mcdonalds All Americans--while Gary did it with exactly THREE. Fantastic Coach. Theres a reason CBS ranks him #3 in the nation.
