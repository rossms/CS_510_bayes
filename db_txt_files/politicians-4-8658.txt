Wilson was a great visionary in both domestic and foregin affairs. He was largely successfull in his domestiv agenda, he created the federal reserve, cut tariffs and regulated the monoploistic trusts. As a war leader he efficiently led the United States to victory in the great war. The US senate rejection af the Versailles treaty was a disaster for Wilson, who was unwilling to compromise and he suffered a near fatal stroke trying to gain popular support for the treaty, after that he became out of toutch with reality of the political situation, he left office a broken man.
