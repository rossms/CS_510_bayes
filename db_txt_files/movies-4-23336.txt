It's been a while since I've seen this, but I remember thinking that it fell short of the classic status afforded it by a lot of people. It was good in other words, but not what I call great. My standard of comparison for sci-fi movies is always Star Wars (and in particular The Empire Strikes Back) and this one wasn't quite in the same league. It did have a big effect on George Lucas, apparently, because three of his characters from Return of the Jedi are named Klaatu, Barada, and Nikto.
