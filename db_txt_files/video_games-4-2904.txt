excellent gameplay. lacks the gaphics to put into into the "great" catagory for me. Although the sheer size of the game and the enjoyment factor still leaves it with a high rating with me. I liked the characters and the radio 80's radio stations are great, who doesn't want to cruise through gang neighbour hoods with the roof down listeniong to Judas Priest.... ahhh, takes you back, doesnt it?
