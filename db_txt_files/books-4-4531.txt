I read this book 10 years ago, and I still can't get the mob scenes out of my head. Crowds gather, women, children, grandmothers, all screaming for blood, all wanting to see the spectacle of the guillotine blade separating head from body. Dickens tells the tale well, a book I still remember from high school. It was the best of times, it was the worst of times....
