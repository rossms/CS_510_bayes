Gobstoppers are excellent. I think they are underappreciated b/c they are so often mistaken for Jawbreakers which have a horrid taste (no one was more disappointed at Halloween than the kid who arrived at my door when only jawbreakers were left...). Anyway, I can eat a whole lotta Gobstoppers -- delicious!
