A product of the system doesn't catch 100 fricking catches in 4 consecutive seasons. A product of the system doesn't catch 100+ TD'. Be fricking reasonable, Manning is a good QB, but Harrison is a good receiver as well. Statistically speaking, he's the most prolific receiver of the past 5-10 years. And he's also one of the best route runners in the NFL, and in his prime he WAS the best, did you even see his 2002 season? He had 143 fricking receptions and still averaged 12+ yards per catch. Please refrain from idiotic mistakes.
