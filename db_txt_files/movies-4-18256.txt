You know, I loved this movie when it was first released. I even bought the soundtrack (sad, but true). I didn't even get the peter-pan reference of the title then. Even though I've read and watched lots of vamp fiction in the last 20 years, this one stands out - it was the first time I saw vamps trying to get along in a modern world. Not too successfully, but trying.
