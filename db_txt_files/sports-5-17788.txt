I AM 16 YEARS OLD I HAVE BEEN A REDSKIN FAN MY HOLE LIFE. MY FIRST GAME I SEEN THEM PLAY IN WAS THE 1992 SUPER BOWL. AGAINST THE BILLS THEY ONE. MY FAMILY WAS HAPPY. THEY HAVE BEEN IN A SLUP FOR A COUPLE YEARS BUT SOON THEY WILL GET BACK ON TRACK. WITH THIS GREAT COACH I LOVE THESE GUYS VERY MUCH AND I THINK THESE ARE A 5 STAR TEAM AND WILL ALWAYS BE A FAN FOR THIS TEAM AS LONG AS I LIVE. HOPE TO PLAY WITH YALL ON THE FIELD IF I KEEP MY GRADES UP AND KEEP DOING GOOD IN HIGH SCHOOL FOOTBALL AND TO START TO RESPECT MY FAMILY AND TO CHANGE MY ATTITUDE HOPE WE GO ALL THE WAY THIS YEAR REDSKINS
