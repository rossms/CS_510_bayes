I really didn't learn much, just brushed up on skills I haven't used in a while. I did have some good teachers, but I had bad ones too. The people that gave me the most trouble were the accounting people. They had lost my financial aid checks and turned me over to collection! No one would return my phone calls or e-mails, the only way I could correspond with them was by showing up in person. I decided to transfer to a community college, and only 9 of my 46 credits from UOP transferred over. So, now I've decided to transfer to a regular 4-year university after I get my Associate's degree.
