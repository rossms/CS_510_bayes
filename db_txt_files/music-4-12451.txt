It's the lyrics that make De La Soul as good as they are. They are the founders of true hip-hop in my book. If it had Bitties in the BK Lounge and Millie Pulled a Pistol on Santa (2 songs from the album: De La Soul Is Dead), it would get 5 stars easy. But as it stands, I like De La Soul Is Dead just a little more.
