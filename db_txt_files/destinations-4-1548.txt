Mostly admire this nation's business practices and achievements but at the same time they are too socially conformist for my nonconformist personality so I would not care to live there. However, their food is heavenly -- I cannot think of any of their sushi dishes or other foods that I do NOT like! I mostly do admire their ideas for teaching and learning and trying to achieve all they are capable of. There's a lot to admire here and some of their ideas are very good, like some housing ideas.
