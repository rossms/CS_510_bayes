The audiovox CDM series, especially the 9000 model, is a light-weight mobile phone that does not use the smart chip as offered by PCS service providers, but if you find a provider that you are happy with, this is not a problem. Direct hook-up to the PC is possible via serial cable (optional) and can thus be used to surf the net. The battery lasts for at least 3 days in stand-by mode and recharging is a speedy process. The only compliant that I have about the button layout is that it's power and talk buttons are reversed from what most other companies use.
