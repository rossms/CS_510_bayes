I tried the alfredo pasta with chicken, and it was awful. The chicken had the consistency of a pea - soft and mushy. The alfredo was kind of gummy too. Initially, I was disappointed in the small portion, but once I tasted it, I knew it would be rough to finish what was there. Maybe other varieties are different, but this particular meal was bad. And for the record, the picture on the box makes it seem a lot more appetizing than the actual food inside the package.
