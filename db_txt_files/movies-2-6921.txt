For personal reasons, I decided to watch this movie once again to see if I missed anything that was funny. After the 2nd viewing, I did see a few things that I missed the first time around. I guess I was a little too judgemental, HOWEVER I still don't think the movie deserves more than 2 stars, but I can see why some people would like it. And I am sure it was probably a refreshing change to some people during the year it came out. I don't think there were too many parody movies in that time frame....
