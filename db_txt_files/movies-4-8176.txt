I remember when this movie came out...and everyone was talking about how funny it was. So I was expecting this to be side-splitting...and it wasn't. I think that everyone had just hyped it up so much and I was expecting so much more that it kinda let me down. It was a funny movie, but not as funny as everyone had made it out to be.
