I liked this movie a lot. I liked the special effects the way the ship looked when it was sinking it gives you a visual image to give you an idea of how the ship looked during this whole process of the sinking. I liked the love traingle that was going on in the movie. I enjoy watching this movie it is something to do on a cold bad day outside.
