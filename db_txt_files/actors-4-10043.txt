Go Jamie! I rate her for keeping it real, with her photo shoot a couple of years ago that exposed the amount of help that these seemingly-perfect movie stars have to make them look georgeous, and keep us all feeling inferior. And Molfon has got it right: With Janet and Tony as parents she had the potential to end up royally screwed-up, but has just done her own thing. She can laugh at herself and the aging process: I liked her roles in True Lies and Freaky Friday. She seems relatively normal, which is a great achievement in Hollywood I reckon...
