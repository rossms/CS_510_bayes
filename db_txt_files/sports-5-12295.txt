Why dont they get 5 stars from everyone? At least a 4 star. This team is amazing. Every player is good on the offense. They got the top 2 runningbacks in NCAA and maybe the top QB. Dwayne Jarrett is a top 5 wide receiver too. Bush is the best player in the nation. 34 straight wins is all I have too say for my 5 stars.
