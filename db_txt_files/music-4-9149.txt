What a nifty idea for a video. Have the guys in the groups day dream of what they would like their video to be like. Mark Mcgraf's is my favorite with the hair band 80's look. You will laugh your money maker off my friend. Not to mention the song is kind of catchy. This is the first funny and original concept I have seen come out of McG as a director. Fun stuff though.
