For such a small city I think it's brilliant that Portland keeps expanding it's Mass transit options. If only Seattle could learn from this. My only complaint is they should have built the light rail tracks underground in downtown Portland as subway stations. The trains go very slow through downtown. Otherwise Bravo ! and keep up the good work !
