Colin Powell is a WONDEFUL man. He has made mistakes but then which of us hasn't. He is excellent for the position of Secretary of State. Before saying any thing bad about him, I suggest you read his book. Any thing he is today he is because he was willing to work hard. He is trully a man I respect.
