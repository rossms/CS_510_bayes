Yes the best president ever was a Republican and many liberals are still trying to revise history in order to win some political currency. Sad they would do this to win a far flung congressional seat today somewhere in southern Illinois or even worse, protecting blacks from the truth. This being that the democrats made up the vast majority of the secessionist, pro-slave and civil rights hating core of the South. Too late fools the books have been written and none of you were around back then to have to credibility to amend them now.
