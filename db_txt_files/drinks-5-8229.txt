The Benziger Carneros Chardonnay is excellent. It goes well with many dishes, and it's reasonably priced. If you get a chance to visit the Benziger Family Winery in Glen Ellen (Sonoma), it's well worth the trip. The tram tour through the vineyards is highly informative, and the scenery is spectacular.
