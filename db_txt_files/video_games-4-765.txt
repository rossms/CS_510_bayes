I find the game itself to be a bit hard, but it is a fun game to play with friends and family. One of my favorite episodes of the TV show, Wings, involved the characters playing this game and one of the guys, Lowell, kept answering every trivia question with Ann Margaret . I've always wondered if that's actually an answer to a trivial pursuit question.
