I think he's overlooked maybe because he has a weird last name. ... Anyway, he's a fine first baseman and the best player on his team. Last season, he led his team in homers, RBI's and batting average. He didn't make the All-Star game last year but he did win the Silver Slugger Award. I expect him to be a major star.
