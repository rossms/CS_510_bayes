I know that the ending has left some people feeling empty, disenchanted etc. I did not share this opinion. I felt the moment was captured very well. It is clear that this character is at a cross roads,in a metaphorical sense, and the event that occured right at the ending I felt contained a message of hope, chance and wonder.Could it have had other endings that would have given greater closure? Sure! Did I feel like I did at the end of, Eyes Wide Shut ? No! This is a wonderful film, but, is maybe not for the viewer that needs endings finished with an upbeat, self explained and defined moment.
