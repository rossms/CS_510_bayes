I enjoy the Islay malts. Lagavulin is my favorite scotch. I have not had the pleasure of comparing it to ardbeg but I do have the Laphroig 10 and much harder to find, 15 year old. I prefer the smooth, non-medicinal character of Lagavulin and enjoy the strong smoke and peat aroma and lingering aftertaste.
