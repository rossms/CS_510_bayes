I think Jon Gruden is the best coach that the NFL has ever seen, he has a lot more years left in the NFL and look what he has done to both the Raiders and the Bucs, last season Oakland was an amazing team because of him and they are not the same team this year without him. Gruden has made a great team out of the Bucs and now they are very likely to make an impression in this year's playoffs. He is definitly one of the most talented coaches in the league right now and by far the sexiest!
