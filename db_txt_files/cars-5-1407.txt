This car is awsome. It stacks up very well against the bigger names Lexus, BMW, Acura, etc. all of which I looked at before choosing the Millenia. You'll be hard pressed to find a better value in a luxury line. This car has EVERYTHING and the ride is smoov-as-buttah! Of course if you just have to drive a house payment that offer the same features; the Lexus is definitely the car for you.
