Allright, Please let me put my two cents in. I love my country (this may sound a bit typical to you), I was born here and raised. It is my homeland. (I know that sounds cheesy, right?) We have our faults. We aren't perfect. I admit that with no problem. But I love being able to have freedom of speech and being able to engage in political debating fiercely. Overall, I've lived here all my life. I'm not an overpatriotic person with a tiny encephalon. I'm a liberal democratic far lefter. I love my country still.
