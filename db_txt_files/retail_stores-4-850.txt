Update: Added a star because their fall line, except for the leopard spotted mocassins, is especially nice, the colors and cuts--my favorite so far (would give 5 stars but their customer service still stinks). I do not find the promo coupons/offers confusing, the wording is not deceptive. Good quality casual clothes. Poor customer service. Insufficient size offerings -- pants run large, the smallest woman's, a 2, is like a 4 and must be ordered. Now they've gotten into some new, confusing way to name the fits with foo-foo sounding names instead of just 'classic', 'relaxed', etc.
