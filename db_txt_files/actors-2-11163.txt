I think she is overrated and simply gets all the parts that they cannot give to julia or (too famous)or catherine zeta (a hack) or renee zelwegger, sorry about butchering the name (because shes not famous enough). Bottom line: her greatest Oscar worthy role-the spurned ex wife of Tom Cruise (great career move Nic).
