Another place I'd love to visit one day.(My stopover in Shannon Airport just won't do!) Looks lush and beautiful- My parents went there twice and loved it:great people,great music,great history.It is said that the "veil between the worlds" is very thin there....that's intriguing! Plus, I LOVE Guinness and have it on reliable sources that what we get here is a pale imitation!
