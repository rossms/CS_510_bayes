The Nokia 5100 Series phone is produced by a Finnish company. This particular phone is a good all around phone with a feature called the NaviKey. The NaviKey is a one touch button that answers and ends. The phone will store up to 99 numbers and names, and with a battery life of two to three days, recharging may be a thing of the past. One particular feature for the fashion conscious is the ability to switch the faceplate for a variety of colors.
