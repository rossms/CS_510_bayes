I could still recognize it from the way it looked in 1977 when I returned to London in 2000. It may not be fancy schmantzy but they seem to be extremely well organized. And - HA - guess what! They treat passengers with courtesy. Very unlike my ugly re-entry to the US as we were herded like cattle by the wiseacre customs people. I felt like telling the little twits to catch the next transatlantic flight to London and observe the way they do it there! How embarrassing.
