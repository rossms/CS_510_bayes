Chauncey couldn't be more wrong. This is a team definitely on the upswing. We're (and I say we because I live in Colorado) going to have quite the hefty pocketbook when the free agency window opens. The juggernaut of the conference (the Lakers) are about to plunge into mediocrity, so the West is up for grabs my friend. Plus, Melo is a player who will only get better and mature with time. Denver vs. San Antonio, 2005 Western Conference Finals; a classic, fast-paced affair that sees Denver winning it in Game 7 at the SBC Center. Mark your calendars.
