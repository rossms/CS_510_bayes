Off the tourist path, but worth seeking out if you are into the very weirdest kinds of art. Do you want to see the doodlings of a death row inmate? How about the ghostly visions of a mental patient? How about a sculpture of heaven and hell made out of tin cans and Pez? If these things are up your alley, run, don't walk to the American Visionary Art Museum.
