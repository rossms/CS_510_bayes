I always had mixed feelings about Andy Kaufman. Like most other people, I thought he was very funny at times, and a complete jerk at others. This movie illustrated why we all felt this way. All he cared about was amusing himself, not the audience. Jim Carrey was so great as Andy that you sometimes forgot you were watching Carrey and not Kaufman. I didn't come away from the film liking him any more or less, only understanding him a little more.
