This man stands firmly on the moral high ground, a beacon in the moral darkness of Al Gore, and the Clintons. Those who oppose him, should search their own moral fiber, and find their own significant moral lackings. Finally a man with backbone enough to Stand for the ONE True God, and not bow their knee to moral relativism.
