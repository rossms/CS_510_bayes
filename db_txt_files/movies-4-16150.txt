The subtle irony that runs thoughout this updated Pygmalion story is in the musical score. The wedding of Rita's younger sister, who is pregnant, keeps playing the song Love Is a Simple Thing, while the marriage of Rita is about to explode. The use of Beethoven, Mahler and Chopin is great in the various parts of the film. Michael Caine and Julie Walters are magnificent.
