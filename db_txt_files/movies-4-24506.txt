I agree that this sequel is not as good as the original. However, it was fun to go back and revisit all the old characters, and most of the aliens, from the first movie. Tommy Lee Jones and Will Smith are very good together. They are exact opposites, so there is lots of material to use for joke writing. You have the young versus old thing, the hip versus square thing, the black versus white thing. There was just so many places that the writers could have taken this movie that, maybe, they were overwhelmed. I am sure they have plenty of unexplored plot twists, so we may see a MIB3 someday. I hope so.
