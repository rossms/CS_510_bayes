I think its a good game. Soul Calibur has what i always wanted in a fighting game like able to walk around your enemy, more then 1 weapon a person and stuff like that. I don't own the game but i rent it about once a month. Its very adictive and fun. Best person is Ivy because she has the longest weapon and has the coolest move in the game...Calamity Symphony
