A great introduction to the Harry Potter series. I enjoyed it from start to finish. Harry's family in the Muggle world is hilarious. I liked Hagrid, Ron, Hermione and other many characters. The transition to Hogwarts was great. Diagonal Alley, Platform 9 3/4 were very appropriate and Hogwarts Express. J.K. Rowling is brilliant! Overall, a very well crafted novel. Rush out and read it.
