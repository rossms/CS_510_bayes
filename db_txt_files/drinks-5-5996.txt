I really like Orangina. It has a very good light but distinct taste with just the right amount of zip in the carbonation. The only problem is that I have never been able to find it packaged in anything except those tiny little light bulb shaped bottles that only hold about 4 oz. I ve never seen it in bottles the size pictured here, but would certainly buy it if I did.
