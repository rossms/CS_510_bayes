Bought mine in mid May and love everything about it. The only problem I've had is the running board pads had to be replaced due to buckling. I have owned several pickups before purchasing my C3 and none can compare with the luxery appointments, power, handling and what i consider a good price way below MSRP and had I waited until mid July I've seen them for $30,500. I have logged 2700 miles and this truck screams speed.
