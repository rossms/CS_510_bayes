I have heard a lot of bad things about Friendly's especially in regards to customer service. But the Friendly's in my state are all great. The service is terrific and the waiters are friendly (no pun intended). The shakes and ice cream are the best bar none. But the food isn't too great. Often the fires and burgers are cold and that goes for many other dishes as well.
