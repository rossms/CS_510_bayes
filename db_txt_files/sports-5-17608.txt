I can explian what's been happening with the Rams....mayn of the key players Warner and Faulk are injured...physically and emotionally. Another problem is that excuse for a coach Mike joke Martz. Any sencible coach would have left Bulger in until warner was fully recoverd emotionally and physically. Mike joke Martz is the main problem on the Rams team this year and was the reason they didn't win the superbowl in January. we need another Dick Vermill. The rams are definatly a very good team. Watch out for us next year!
