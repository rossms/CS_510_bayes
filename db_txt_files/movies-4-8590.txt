My wife and I have always enjoyed Sandra Bullock s movies. We rented Miss Congeniality and once again found ourselves thoroughly entertained. From front to back, we laughed all the way through the movie. Certainly not a great piece of classic art but served its purpose well as a Saturday night comedy rental.
