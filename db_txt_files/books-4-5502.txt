A very good read, based on the Odyssey. Inman, our Odysseus, attempts to return home across the late-Civil-War landscape of North Carolina and encounters a series of adventures each of which is modeled on a chapter of the Odyssey. My favorite part was the Cyclops (I'll leave it to you to figure out which is which, and also which are Circe, Scylla and Charybdis, Calypso...) A lot of people complain about the ending (I won't give it away) but I found the whole to be quite moving.
