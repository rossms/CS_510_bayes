This video nearly made me tear up the first time I saw it. How'd they get my youth up there on screen? Growing up in the California suburbs we saw our share of house parties and midnight swimming in neighbors pools. Whenever I see this video I am reminded of the freedom of youth that is so lacking in adulthood.
