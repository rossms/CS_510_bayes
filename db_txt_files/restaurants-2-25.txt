Purchased from founders by a Middle Eastern fellow with oil money. Coffee prepackaged became more and more aged on the shelf. Now he has expiry date on bags (his concept - not industry concept) and refuses to show roasting date. The only fresh roasted product in the U.S is Peets. Caribou is becoming like Walmart of coffee. So long, Mr. Sheik.
