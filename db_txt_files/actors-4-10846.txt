I saw her in Pulp Fiction and my first thought was Wow! She can act! She was good in Gattaca as well. I don't think she's very pretty, but her acting is wonderful. This girl knows how to get inside of a character and even the most ruthless, heartless characters (i.e Kill Bill) she can make you love.
