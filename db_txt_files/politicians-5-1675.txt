The smartest man I had the pleasure to meet.Determination and iron will have taken him from an unknown Austrian to Governor of California. Just ask yourself: why is he doing this? He could retire with his millions and enjoy life, instead he works his butt off for you and me. He wants to repay what this country has offered him; pretty decent I would say. To all the nay sayers out there: what have you accomplished in life to judge this man harshly? Get a life, let him work and see what is accomplished after 4 years.
