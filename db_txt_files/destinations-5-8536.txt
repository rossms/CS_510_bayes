I've noticed Grizzly smokeless tobacco got the highest rating pn rateitall.com and i've never tryed the stuff. I've been staying faithful to Cophenhagen black and Skoal wintergreen and sometimes Redmen pouch tobacco. Could someone describe the taste of the regular straight Grizzly?? Ok, I went out and bought a thing of grizzly wintergreen, alot cheaper than Skoal and stronger.
