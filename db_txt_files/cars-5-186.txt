You can't say enough good things about a HONDA. I had my 250R for about a year and a half. My bike didn't run as well as I wanted it to, but it still hauled butt. I knew some people that had great running 250R's and they were crazy fast machines. Nothing beats the thrill of hitting the powerband of a two-stroke. Nothing beats a HONDA.
