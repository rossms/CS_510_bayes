Brandy's not one of the greatest singers, but she uses vocal techniques that makes her voice sound very inviting at times. She shines the most when she uses those techniques over rhythmic, beat heavy tracks. On her first album, you can tell that she was inspired by Aretha Franklin. This album displayed her best vocals ever.
