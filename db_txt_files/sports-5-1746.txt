Anybody but the Yankees, baby! Anybody but the Yankees. Of course, Fenway Park is a national treasure. But the team's history, while very interesting, has been sorely lacking in that championship spirit. Things are looking up. So far in '02, the BoSox pitching staff is excellent, but their bats have been hot and cold. The Olde Towners should make it to the '02 postseason (assuming no strike). After that, who knows? I hope they can take it all the way during my lifetime.
