People are super friendly, cultured, tolerant, and love to have fun, dress and eat well. Service, even in small restaurants, is discreet and wonderful. Festivals, shows, nightlife, fashion and shopping are great. It has the american comfort, but delights you with the french flavor and style. Perfect.
