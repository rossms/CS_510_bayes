I have spent alot of time in Cleveland and even though it has its problems as every other city, it is a very fun city to spend time in. I currently live in Pittsburgh, the boring and depressed capital of the world, and Cleveland is by far a million times more fun a much better area to live. I cant wait to get out of Pittsburgh. CLeveland is great and has alot of potential. Pittsburgh is a has been city and is spiraling down so fast it isnt even funny.
