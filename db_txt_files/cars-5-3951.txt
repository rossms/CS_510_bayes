I bought it because I wanted more room for hauling, as in utility vehicle. It does that job just fine, has enough power for regular usage, and isn't so large that I need my own area code to park in. It also has a lot better gas milage then most SVUs, which may not be too important to some, but was an important factor in my decision. The 2002's also look a lot better then the previous models. I'm not planning to go up any mountains with it. The RAV4 was the other option and a good choice, but I liked the way the CRV folds down for storage a lot better.
