A great western/thriller, this Ron Howard film was terrific. Cate Blanchett shines as the hardened healer/rancher in New Mexico in 1885. She brings both remarkable grace and grit to the role. When her eldest daughter is captured by an Indian witch doctor and his abnd of renegade soldiers, she turns to her estranged father for help, masterfully played by Tommy Lee Jones. The wisdom, humor and age he brings forth is terrific. Also starring talents like Evan Rachel Wood and Aaron Eckhart, its exciting, heart-breaking and definitely worth watching.
