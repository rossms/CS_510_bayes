Kobe is a good if not great basketball player, but to even think of comparing him to MJ is unfair. Also, the better player on that team is Shaq, hands down. If you have watched the finals(so far), Shaq has been dominating while Kobe has been inconsistant. Also, Iverson is a far better player and carries his team with far less support than Kobe has.
