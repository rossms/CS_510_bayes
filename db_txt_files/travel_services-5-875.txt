Moving Staffers loaded my Movex truck in New Jersey and unloaded me in Seattle, WA - At both ends they had professional movers to help me. My husband has a bad back - Moving Staffers not only helped us save alot of $$ but they also did it with a very professional crew at both ends. Great Job! I will be sure to let all of my friends and family know to use them in the future.
