I didn't realize Ray Allen hasn't missed a single game in his entire 5-year career. Not only is he talented, he's tough and consistent. I hadn't watched him all that much until the current playoffs - which, since Allen plays for a small-market team, is probably true for a lot of other casual basketball fans, too. And that's a shame - he's an impressive player who deserves a brighter spotlight. But I'll hold off on giving him five stars until (and if) I see him take the Bucks past the 76ers.
