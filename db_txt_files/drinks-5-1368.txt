I drank a lot for the first time last night, and enjoyed it. I've had Budwieser, Bud Lite, and this brand. Miller was by far the best tasting of the three. Nice, refreshing, and didn't leave an after taste like Bud did. Two cans went down without me even knowing. I guess I got cocked so I had pizza. But it was a fun time though. And I didn't puke or anything either. It was great for me, but I haven't really tried much beer or have much experience yet.
