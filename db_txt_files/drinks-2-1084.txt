I still don't understand how this beer is so popular. It has no flavor, well the flavor it has is like mexican pee. It's probably so popular because Mexico has no potable water so they have to drink this crap. Alot of kids on campus drink Corona and it boggles me. I'd pick anything over that, maybe not Bud, but alot of other crap by my standards.Try one and ask yourself the same thing I did-Why do so many people drink this crap?
