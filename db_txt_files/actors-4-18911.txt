He's biased. He projects stereotypes while railing against others. He's an easy target to hit, but there's no denying his talent as a director. (I wish I could bash him more.) Do the Right Thing isn't perfect but it's a damn good film. And the most underrated Lee film is the terrific Clockers. Lee is an artist that forces you to respect him but not like him. Give him his due.
