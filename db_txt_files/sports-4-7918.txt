He needs to be put on a team that will do him justice. I find him extremely talented and just the fact that he slid into his role in the NBA after playing high school basketball with such ease is enough for me to give him a 5. He hasn't shown us all of what he's got yet, so he gets 1 star taken off. They should put him in the Nets' team. He would be great there.
