Nat Sherman cigarettes aren't regulary smokes. I guess you can call them luxurious cigarettes. They're 100% natural tobacco, with no chemical additives. They're smooth, rick and mellow, and are extremely strong. Smoking one Nat Sherman is like smoking two Marlboro Reds at the same time. The cigarette smoke gives off a strong odor, but is well worth the taste.
