A little trouble keeping things in stock, but generally they have very friendly employees and a super selection of gourmet baked goods, healthy snacks, premium soft drinks , wines, cheeses. Meat and produce are of high quality, but selection is less than that of a normal supermarket. Trader Joe's housebrand cookies and muffins are great! Prices are the lowest you'll find for gourmet items. Loss leaders include milk and Charles Shaw wines...take advantage!
