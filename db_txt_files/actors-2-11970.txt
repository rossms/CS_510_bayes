I haven't seen much strength as a performer from this young woman as of yet. Perhaps that will change. She looks very much like Natalie Portman but has yet to prove she has the staying power that Natalie does. I don't think she is as pretty as some seem to think. She is certainly much less attractive than Kate Winslet and not at all the best actress from the UK.
