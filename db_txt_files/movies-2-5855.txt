I know that Orsen Wells is a great director and that 'Citizen Kane' is a revoluntionary film but since I took a lot of film classes in college, I have seen this movie too many times. It was good the first time and there is a lot of symbolisim within the settings, camera angles, costumes, music etc. but I just don't see it being this monumental life changing film. I am not downplaying that Citizen Kane offers a lot to its audience, it is a classic but I just can't bear to see it again.
