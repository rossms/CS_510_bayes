I love this car! I have a 2000 Echo it's been great on gas, i've had no problems at all. Dependable, fun to drive. As for the people that thinks its an ugly car, thats you're opinion. I think it's the cutest and most interesting looking car on the road! As for short people, well this car was made for me! My lease will be up soon, and i can say for sure, i will get a new Echo! Thank you Toyota!
