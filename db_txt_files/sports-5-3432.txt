Schmidt is one of those people who will suffer historically because of the recent hitting explosion.. He was an outstanding fielder.. Robinson was better, but not by a whole lot.. Schmidt stole as may as 29 bases in ayear and over 200 in his career, he drew more walks than anyone else at the time, and won 8 homerun titles. His average wasn't great, but for the time it was ok.. If he played today he would hit .280-.290 with 50-60 home runs every year, playing gold glove quality defense. He was simply the best baseball player between 1970 and 1990 and I think that deserves 5 stars.
