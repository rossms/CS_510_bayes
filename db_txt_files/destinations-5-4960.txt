Easily one of the most beautiful, awe-inspiring states. You can snorkel through schools of amazingly colored fish in Huanama Bay one day and watch magma flowing into the ocean from Volcanoes National Park the next. And if you re there be sure check out Pearl Harbor there s an interesting museum/memorial on the water over one of the battleships sunk by the Japanese.
