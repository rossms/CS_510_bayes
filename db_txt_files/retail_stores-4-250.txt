When I went to this store, I found the workers to be extremely friendly and helpful, which I loved. I think they have great, classy clothing, but I will agree that they do need to step up their selection, even though there is a lot in the store I really like. I will agree it is a little more costly than most mall stores, but their clothes are fit better, and made better...they're quality.
