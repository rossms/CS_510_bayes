I've lived there long time ago. The capitol city is beautiful. There is so many wonderful places and sights. The Maiden Tower is extremely unique, and very old. The weather is worm and pleasant. Refreshing breeze comes from the Caspian sea, and food and music has its own taste and sound. I don't know what country looks or feels like now.
