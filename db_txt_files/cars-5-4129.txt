Just bought a 2002 and thouroughly love it. When I 1st saw the Aztek I thought they were very UGLY! But since I don't have small penis syndrom I don't try to compensate with flashy vehicles!! The Aztek rides and handles great, gets good mileage and is second to none for its utlilitarian purposes! I don't drive clones like the rest of the lackeys who are trying to keep up with the Jones'. I would buy anothet Aztek in a heartbeat...and probably will!
