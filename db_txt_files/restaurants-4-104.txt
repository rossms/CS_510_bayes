Hey, the coffee isn't great. We all know it tastes a little burnt. But I must admit that I have fallen in love with their Imperialistic ways. Conquering new territory, forcing their value system upon others. It is great! When they came to Japan they said Hell no you can't smoke in here to chain smoking mitsubishi driving drunks! Way to go! Smoke free forever!!!!
