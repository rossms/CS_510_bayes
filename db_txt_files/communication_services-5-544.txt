NexTel is the worst at service. First it was through their store that my identity information was stolen. They continue by sending products to the unknown individual and sending me the bill. The total is just over $2500.00 now and shows no signs of stopping. They just don't seem to care. They do not have any interest in catching the thieves, instead they reward them with still more products. If you do not need the point to point, walkie-talkie feature, AVOID nextel. They just don't give a rat's ass about taking care of the customer.
