This is the best large sedan that anyone can purchase. I bought a 2000 Buick Lesabre Limited with the Prestige Package and the Gran Touring Package and Leather Seats. I have just finished 1000 miles of driving it and their is absolutely nothing wrong with the vehicle. I would highly reccommend this car to anyone who is considering buying a large full size sedan.There is no way Chrysler or Ford or any foreign vehicle can match the Lesabre in value for the price of the car.
