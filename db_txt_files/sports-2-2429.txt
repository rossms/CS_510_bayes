A proud franchise from the mid 70's through the 80's, with stars like the great George Brett, McRae, Wilson, Saberhagen, Splitorff, Gura, Busby, Quisenberry, White, and Mayberry, to name just a few. Quite a few division champions, and 2 Series clubs including the 85 Champs. Unfortunately, the economics of the game and failing attendance, plus playing in a tiny market have reduced this once rather fearsome club into a generally awful club that's lucky to break .500, as they did in 2003.
