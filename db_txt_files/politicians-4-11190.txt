Only senator with courage to stand up against President Bush. And guess what- he was 100% right and Bush was 100% wrong. You people should change your rankings in light of the fact that he was proven RIGHT on Iraq and showed backbone when every other democrat was afraid. P.S.- a pork barrel fanatic.
