This drink has a refreshing, almost cinnamony flavor. Until reading the ingredients, I didn't realize that it contained decaf green tea (I assumed it was just an herbal tea). While it also contains ginger, agave, and lemongrass, it doesn't actually have any cinnamon. A small amount of sugar gives it 34 calories per 16 oz bottle.
