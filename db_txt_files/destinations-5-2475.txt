I agree with Donovan, the west coast of Florida does have some of the most beautiful beaches in the state, especially the Sarasota area. I used to live on Anna Maria Island right off of Bradenton, where the water was so pristine blue that when you walked out onto the public pier you could see large reds swimming below that seemed close enough to reach out and touch them. This area also has some of the cleanest beaches as well and an abundance of sand dollars.
