Nice place. Even though the food is not authentic, it is still very good. Breadsticks are great. The soup didn't look very promising though. As for the 3 meat ravoli..creamy and filling. We were seated right away and we were given our food quick. The restaurant itself is very nice with stone walls and clean rooms. Our waitress did seem a little bit in a rush though. For a moderate priced family dinner, eat at Olive Garden.
