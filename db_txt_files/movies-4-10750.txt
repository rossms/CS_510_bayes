This movie had a lot of laughs. It starred so many great comedians. I really liked the part where Jon Lovitz stole Hitler's car, burnt his tongue, got hitler's mustache and started mumbling words. He looked and acted like Hitler it was hilarous. Rowan Atkinson is so funny and Wayne Knight and the list goes on. Good to see a funny movie that is appropriate for kids also.
