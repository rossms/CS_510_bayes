God took a chisel and said, I'm gonna make me a quarterback! And, thus, John Elway was born. He was the perfect quarterback, with leadership, touch, size, athleticism and a howitzer of an arm. He was surrounded by TERRIBLE teams early in his career and still managed to carry them to 3 Super Bowls, where he lost to some of the greatest teams of all time. Yes, his team mostly carried him when he finally won, but don't forget: he's won the most games of any QB, also. He did everything he could during his career, and did it well. The best ever!
