I never thought I was a hard rock fan. I always hated it back in the day, but my boyfriend kept playing this album called Brutal Planet by Alice Cooper. Well,of course I knew who Alice was, the man is a legend, but I guess I didn't pay enough attention. This guy is terrific. This is the best hard rock album,I personally have ever heard.
