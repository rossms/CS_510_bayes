New York city is a thriving paradox.A never ending erruption of culture and humanity....gateway to this splendid nation.The ultimate meltingpot.A most sincere town that will swallow whole the timid and ignorant and catapult those who excercise courage to new heights.The energy of New York is certainly unrivaled in the States and you would be hard pressed to find a city abroad that could match its intensity.I have traveled to many places and had many wonderfull expieriences...each place possesed its own unique charm or lack there of however New York is a Juggernaut when it comes to charecter.UNIQUE
