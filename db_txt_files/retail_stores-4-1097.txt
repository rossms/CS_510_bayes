Nothing beats a good pair of butt huggers for frolicking in the waves, especially if they're speedos! I like mine a couple sizes too small so it's extra form fitting. Speedos prove the saying that less can sometimes be more, as in the less suit there is the more revolting it is for everyone in your immediate area.
