I find it hard to rate Torre, because he has had the luxury that so few managers have, that is of running a team with so much talent. Certainly, he has delivered, unlike Bobby Cox, and deserves considerable credit for that. I see no particular signs of great tactical thinking in him, but that may be because he doesn't require as much with the Yankee talent. Give him a bunch like the Rangers or Astros, and lets see how he does then.
