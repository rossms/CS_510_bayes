Pobody's Nerfect -- WRONG. Obviously you don't know a good general manager in baseball when you see one. Duquette has never alienated Pedro or Nomar (that must have come straight from your ass) and Jimy Williams isn't the genius everyone thinks. Manny hasn't done too much in Fenway so far this year (except rank top three in nearly every major statistical category) not to mention hold his own is left field. Quite the mockery , eh?
