Great player and even better person. A winner if there ever was one. Unfortunately he's coached by an idiot ( Mike Tice) who doesnt seem to like him that much and doesnt use him enough. Mewelde used as a starter can get you 100 yards and a TD rushing. He's a tough, shifty runner who knows how to gain yards and shake tackles. He can catch passes out of the backfield and can even return punts if needed. He's a Brian Westbrook/Warrick Dunn-type of back. Who would'nt want that kind of guy on their team?
