Mark Twain is one of the greatest American authors of all time in my view. I read this novel in the 6th grade and was quite amused with its language (which was hard to follow at some points) and its tale of a mischevious young boy who lives through and witnesses hard times. This truly touches base on 19th century race relations, something that Twain is often criticized for. However, I agree with the post which said that he was merely chronicaling his times, not agreeing with them.
