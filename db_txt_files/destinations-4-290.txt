This city is immensely superior to Auckland, but still cannot even get close to comparing with Queenstown and is roughly on par with Christchurch. New Zealand's capital manages to be roughly the same size as its Australian counterpart but ten times as interesting. Any tourist to New Zealand should probably attempt to visit Wellington, but do not be too disappointed if you miss it - just as long as you get to Queenstown.
