Anything where the Yankees lose with the help of a villain can't be all bad, can it? ^_^ This energetic musical was a pleasant surprise. Ray Walston and Jean Stapleton have great supporting roles, and many of the songs are good. The coreagraphy with these songs is what truly stands out, especially in the "Shoeless Joe" number.
