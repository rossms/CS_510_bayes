This is a really good book that illustrates several different themes that concern today's affluent culture. Issues like the use of genetics to create people, political freedom, and the tryanny of the majority. Without handing the reader any answers, Huxley encourages the reader to compare and contrast our lives with the lives of John Savage, Mufasta, Mond, and Bernard.
