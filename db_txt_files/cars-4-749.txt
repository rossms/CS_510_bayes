I have a TREK 930, which I got back in '96. It is a very durable bike, probably due to the CroMoly steel frame. I still have the original brake pads, and just last year replace all the cables. The only problem that I had with it was the rear cogset had to be replace at around 1200 miles. I don't ride it through mud, but will take it through most terrain, when dry. It is a 16.5 frame and fits my 5'9 frame well. Very comfortable and fun to ride. I would get another TREK for my wife, so we can ride together.
