The people are humle and friendly, there is pony trekking, hiking, mountain biking, water sports, bushman paintings, guided tours of the dam/resevoir shemes, etc. for outdoor activities. For more city-orientated activities, Maseru (the capital) may be able to hold your attention for a short holiday. If you are looking for this, December and January are the best times to come, not just because it will be summer then, but because all the younger people come home from university and school for holidays. The vibe picks up considerabley at this time. Highly recommended, and value for money.
