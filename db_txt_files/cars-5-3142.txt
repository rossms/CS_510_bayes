I can't believe that some idiots here are comparing a $17,000 car to a $40,000 car. Obviously the Mustang is better, loser. 170hp for an economy car is excellent! Oh yeah, this car has beaten every other car in the class, even the slow Civic Si. The Japs make good cars, but thier not fast!! Oh yeah, too, I guess that some people have forgotten that the Focus has gotten hundreds of awards and was rated one of the Top 10 Best Cars by Car and Driver.
