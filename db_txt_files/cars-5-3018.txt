I love my baby. She might not be the best in the snow, but she was never meant to a be a winter vehicle. There's nothing like driving down the highway on a summer day with the top down, some good music playing, and the sun shining down. My Miata takes corners like nobody's business - the key is in the tires. The car is extremely customizable, especially if you get involved with a local club. These machines are also known to be VERY reliable. A couple of Miata owners I know have driven their vehicles over 300K miles with no major problems to speak of, and their cars are still going strong.
