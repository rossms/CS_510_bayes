I don't eat there very often but I have to admit I do like KFC and sometimes the urge to get some is just overwhelming. Perhaps Mike Meyers father in the movie So I Married An Axe Murderer was correct and the Colonel puts an addictive drug in his chicken to keep you coming back, but whatever it is when I start to eat it I find myself really plowing through it. Of course afterwards I feel pretty glutunous but what can you do. Best part? peeling off a big crispy strip of skin and stuffing it all in my mouth at once. Mmmmmhhh grease.
