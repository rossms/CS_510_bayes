I love it. Encourage my teenage sons to play it with me as a means of teaching them to focus their thoughts. Anything to help them stick with boring school work:) I bought myself a little chess computer $39 which is great for those times when noone wants to play. Takes about 15mins per game if I set the level around 10. Levels go up to 72 but the higher you go- the longer you have to wait for the comp to make it's move and I'm not patient enough for that.
