Larson is extremely classic. The humor is blatant and even somewhat dry at times, but most people grew up with Larson calenders and comics. When I was a kid I loved reading the comic book daily with all the cows and stuff. Larson always did a good job illustrating humorous human qualities into various animals or handmade objects. I bet he's one hella weird dude.
