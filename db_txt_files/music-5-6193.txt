This is yet another one of limp BiZKiT's matserpeices, at it's heaviest. This makes the fact that they are going to commerical that it hurts tolerable simply because of the raw passion in the music in this album. i reckon that all three of the albums are total matserpeices, but this has to be one of the best of the three! there is something in Limp's music that u can hear that u cant always find in other music, with other bands and this is the album that started it. this one took a while to be recognised. this is limp, doing what they do best...
