thanks admerald I always wondered why people called it two different things....but now that that's cleared up... These Harry Potter books are excellent. Any audience can read them...so if you are reading them to your children you will enjoy them also. The sorcerers stone (or philosopher's stone) is not the best of the series but it is necessary to read the first to truly enjoy the rest of them.
