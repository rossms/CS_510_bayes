GREATEST MEXICAN RESTAURANT FOR THE MONEY! I live in Austin and miss it so much. All we have is Taco Hell which isn't anything compared to Taco Bueno. The closest Taco Bueno to me is in Waco which is 100 miles away. I'm planning a road trip just so I can eat there. Please build one in austin, please!
