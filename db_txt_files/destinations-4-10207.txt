Well, I just now smoked my first one after being faithful to Marlboro Medium 100's. My only real complaint is that if you are stepping down, you really have to suck in to get anything at all out of these. I guess i have more than one, because Marlboro Lights do seem more harsh than Mediums. (Is it just cause i had to inhale so deeply to get the same effect?) Overall a good cigarette. But if you don't smoke, don't start because of a rating you see. Take advice from someone who started for that reason.
