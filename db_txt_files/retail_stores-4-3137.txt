I really like Hollywood Video. A lot better than BallBuster Video. Their customer servic is worlds better. If you have a late fee, they don't send you letters and report you to credit agencies. Game Crazy is also a superb feature of Hollywood Video. Even though Blockbuster has significantly more locations, they'd better watch out for Hollywood.
