This snack bag is full of awesome goodness. It has everything you need to satisfy the munchies: little pretzels, pretzel stix, little breadsticks, sesame nuggets, and rye chips. I LOVE the rye chips. If they made a bag with just those in it, I'd buy that as well! And the sizes of the snacks are perfect for kids, too. I don't eat snack foods all that much, but when I get a craving, I get a bag of Gardetto's Snak-Ens. Yum!
