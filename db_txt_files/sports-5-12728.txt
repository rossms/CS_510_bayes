Bob Stoops sure has done a great job turning this program around. He has one of the top players in the country in Josh Heupel. And, his defense did a nice job against Nebraska which shouldn't be a huge surprise given his history as a defensive coordinator with Florida and Kansas State. With big and convincing wins in three straight games against Texas, Kansas State, and Nebraska, the Sooners deserve to be number one. Unfortunately, they may have to beat Nebraska again to win the Big 12 championship.
