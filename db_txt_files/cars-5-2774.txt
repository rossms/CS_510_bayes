I own a 1993 Celica GT-S and I absolutely LOVE the car. It's reliable, efficient (has better fuel economy than even my family car (both of them)!!), quick, and solid. It corners very well, accelerates quickly, and runs smoothly. I've never had any problems with it. I definitely recommend the Celica to anyone who's looking for a sports coupe at a reasonable price.
