The absolute best transportation system I ever seen its air conditioned, quiet, spotless, and has carpet. The people are respectful and orderly(Other cities should visit washington for tips) Also a very scenic city for it to be so small it contains a very big city atmosphere and is the only city on the east coast that does not have a inferior complex when it comes to NY! Besides the way the city is made up and built your more likley to compare it to paris or london before NewYork.
