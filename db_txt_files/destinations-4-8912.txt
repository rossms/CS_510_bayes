Oh yeah, the good old chew - not dip. This was great. Very sweet and you could put a big wad of this in your cheek. I still remember when Beechnut came out with the re-sealavle puch to keep the contents fresh. What an innovation in the packaging industry since there was nothing worse than dried out chewing tobacco. This is really simlar tasting to Red Man.
