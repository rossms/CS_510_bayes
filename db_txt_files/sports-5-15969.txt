If anybody deserves to play for a contender, it's Corey Dillon. He is definitely the best back that nobody has ever heard of, holding the record for most rushing yards as a rookie, and most rushing yards in a single game. Also, every time I have seen him interviewed, he comes across as humble, unassuming, and team focused. I'm sure there are 20 franchises who are drooling about his impending free agency...
