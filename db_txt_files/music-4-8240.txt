Okay, before I get started, let me just say that I was a fan of MC Hammer at the time his video came out and I wore out my cassette tape. But when I think of this video I start to laugh, not because the video .... but because of the parody Tommy Davidson did of MC Hammer U CAN'T TOUCH THIS on IN LIVING COLOR in the early 90's, don't your remember when he got caught up in his pants?? It was funny. But still, I liked Hammer.
