Adolf Rupp was very business-like in his aproach to basketball. He looked for every angle, every opportunity to advance his cause, and was extremely limited in his focus. Rupp used these personal qualities to rule college basketball for 41 seasons. Better known Nazi's used these same methods in an attempt to rule the world. As NAZI's go, Rupp was alright.
