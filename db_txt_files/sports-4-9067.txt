Can't believe the hornets left us here in Charlotte. And they took the Baron..hes a great player very agile..I dunno about extreme speed but...he's fast. Great ability..we miss him here but we've got the bobcats now and they will prove themselves worthy of taking over their position as the QC'S nba team.
