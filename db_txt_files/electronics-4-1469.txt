I'm not sure what makes one receiver better than others, but I've had this one for about 10 years and I have had no problems. You can program multiple radio stations (but, save the manual to figure out how), hook it up to the TV for surround sound, and plug your CD player directly into it so that you don't have to turn both on separately when you want to play a CD. I know it has a lot more features which would be a real benefit to someone who knew a lot more than I did. But, overall, it serves me just fine.
