I thought Devry was great! I especially saw a difference when I had to go looking for a new job in the past month. Had an offer for $12k more than I made in my last job. Big difference from when I didn't have my degree. The professors were excellent as well the financial aid office. On a two year sabbatical, I had to pay back my loan from Devry. The financial aid person was excellent and by far the best credit person I've ever dealt with. I would do it over in a heartbeat. As a matter of fact, I'm currently attending Keller in Phx for my MISM and have been impressed.
