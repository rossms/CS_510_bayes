kerry s. u suck balls. Timmy is the man. No one can defend him anywhere. If you think I'm wrong then just look at who is the current MVP of the entire league. Oh he just got lucky some of you dicks might say but than explain why he's gotten it two years in a row! Tim D. is an awesome player and is definatley already on of the 50th greatest players of all time!
