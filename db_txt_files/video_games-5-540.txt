The greatest board game ever. Tests your patience and perception. . .but it can be just as fun putting on a death-metal album, bringing out a few beers, and having a 'loud' match with your buddy. . .the game never stops challenging and no two games are exactly the same. Easy game to learn, difficult to master. . .
