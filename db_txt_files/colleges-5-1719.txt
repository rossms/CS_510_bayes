The Ohio State business school (Max M. Fisher College of Business) is ranked in the top 15 in the country, the marketing program is 17th and real estate program is 3rd. Like many colleges, the quality of the college depends on the program that someone is involved in. I give the business school 5 stars, but I give the University as a whole 4 stars because of the size and cost.
