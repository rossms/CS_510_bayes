This is one of the best cigarettes I have had in my life. Its so rich and smooth its amazing. This is high quality tobacco. At first I was dissapointed, because I didn't think it tasted too different from a Camel Filter, but by the time I was done with my first tin I could definitely taste the subtle vanilla and cream flavor. I strongly reccomend this or any other Camel cigarette.
