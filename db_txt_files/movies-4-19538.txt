Crazy movie. I actually had seen a clip of the ending before seeing the film as it was one of Bravo's Scariest Movie Moments. I wouldn't really classify this film as horror either until the last scene. I liked how it all came together at the end, and yikes, it is really chilling to see a man just crying out to God for help while all the townsfolk sing joyfully down below. That got me.
