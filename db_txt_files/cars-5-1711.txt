My 01 zx3 5 sp is not perfect, 4 1/2 stars would have been my choice. I love the room for such a small car. There are alot of nice features that I only discovered after I bought the car. I plan to modify motor and suspension and I see the aftermarket growing daily. If this were for my wife, I could leave it stock and be perfectly happy with the way it drives.
