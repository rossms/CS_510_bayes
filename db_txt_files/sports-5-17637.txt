What an awesome defense. With the addition of Wilkerson and Stephen Davis. The return of Kris Jenkins, Buckner and Peppers. The only question mark is Jake Delhomme and I believe he will come through and mature with the talent around him. The Carolina Panthers will be a team to reckon with for years to come!
