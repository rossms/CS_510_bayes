Although it's hard to argue against Lenny being one of the best of all time, he will not save the knicks. From his last coaching job in Toronto, he took a mediocre team, left them mediocre. He could also be partly to blame for all of Toronto's injury problems last year. Also...he may be the winningest coach of all time... but he also holds the record for the most losses.
