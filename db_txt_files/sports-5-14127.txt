It's incredible that Montana wasn't taken until the third round of the NFL draft. He only went on to become the best player in NFL history. He wasn't the fastest or the strongest, just simply the best. He was 4 for 4 in Super Bowls and won the MVP in 3 of those. He led his teams to miraculous comebacks, the most famous of which was against the Bengals when he drove the team 92 yards for the game winning TD in the last minute. He was so calm and collected and was perfectly suited for Bill Walsh's West coast offense.
