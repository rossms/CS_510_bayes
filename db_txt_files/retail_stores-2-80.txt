In regards, to music, Borders blows Barnes & Noble off the map. The music selection is not only more extensive, but also more sophisticated. However, when I go to a bookstore, I care more about the book selection above all else. And the selection here is terrible. Most stores are significantly smaller than Barnes & Noble, and tend to be more disorganized.
