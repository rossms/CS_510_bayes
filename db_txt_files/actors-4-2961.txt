Sean is so in his own league...how far? This far - He was allowed to play the Russian sub captain in Hunt for Red October in a broad Scotts brogue. Laughed my head off, but it shows you how much kudos he has. Sexier as he got older and got rid of the glossy dead beavers they used to glue to his head. Ah Sean, you're definitely the business! PS, looks like a Thunderbird puppet in the photo you've got of him.
