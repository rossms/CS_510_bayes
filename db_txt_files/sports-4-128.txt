A very fine player but overrated offensively as most people put far too much emphasis on batting average. When judging leadoff hitters one has to start with on-base %. His lifetime OBP in this country is .372..very good but not overwhelming by any means. He has had two seasons with OBPs in the 380's but last season it was .352 which is not good for a leadoff hitter. He did NOT deserve the 2001 AL MVP award; another example of the collective ignorance of the BBWAA.
