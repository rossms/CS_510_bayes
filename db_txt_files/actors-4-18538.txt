Made two great films ( Citizen Kane and Touch of Evil ), a very good one ( The Magnificent Ambersons ), a few OK entries and some crap. Peaked out on his second film at the age of 27 and would only come up to that level one more time 16 years later. The rest of his career was totally undistinguished, which makes my four-star rating more charitable than it should be.
