As a Buckeye fan, I would have given former coach Cooper a 2, in comparison, possibly a 1 for game-time coaching. Tressel clearly knows how to win, of that there can be little doubt. However, Craig Krenzel came out after being drafted and stated that he was not entirely happy with the offensive scheme run at OSU (though Krenzel's opinion does not take his abilities into honest consideration, methinks). Needless to say, it will truly be in the years to come that we can evaluate coach Tressel as he is using almost entirely players that he has recruited and coached starting in 2004-2005.
