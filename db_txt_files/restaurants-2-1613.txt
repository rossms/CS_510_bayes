Actually, oodie, the reason that Kentucky Fried Chicken changed their name to an abbreviation is because it was exposed that the restaurant was actually using genetically-engineered clucks and not real chickens. I think that it was determined that it would have been false advertising to continue to be known as Kentucky Fried Chicken.
