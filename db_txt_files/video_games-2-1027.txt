Yea whatever, I have an awful lot of resentment for this game.. I am not quite sure why. Maybe because i NEVER won..and I ALWAYS..EVERY SINGLE TIME landed on that one stupid space that led to the huge slide from the top of the board to the bottom. I am not even sure I ever actually finished a game..I think I kept going around in a circle. Screw chutes and ladders..My husband will have to play it with our kids.
