Flying to Houston from Honolulu, in coach, was a back wrenching experience. Other than the junk seats service was great. On the way back I volunteered to give up my seat due to overbooking. I was given a $500 travel voucher, hotel, meals and an upgrade to first class. I was told continental has the best first class. It was great. The food, service and seats were so great that I didn't mind the 8 hour flight.
