I didn't know there were multiple versions of this video but the one I saw was pretty effective. It consists of what appear to be scenes from old war movies interlaced with the head-banging rockers. The way the crippled soldier batters his head against his pillow, expressing his suicidal desires through morse code, his only method of communication, is pretty chilling.
