I spent a summer living in San Diego. It's tough to beat the weather and the amazing beaches. It's also pretty nice to walk into a grocery store and see a woman walking around in a bikini with a parrot on her shoulder. But after the initial flash wore off, I got a little tired of the people - at least the young people. Let's just say that in general they weren't rocket scientists, and they weren't exactly concerned with global overpopulation, the questionable state of contemporary literature, or human rights abuses in China.
