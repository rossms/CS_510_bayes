Recently I've bought a JVC camcorder from Costco and I was intending on returning it and getting a refund. But I am so fascinated with this camera that I can't give it up. It's got so many features on it that I haven't even used. I like its 270 degree rotatable side screen which allows you to take pictures yourself.
