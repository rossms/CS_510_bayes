Pennington is an accurate QB, but he hasn't been too impressive statistically. I mean, Trent Green is an accurate QB with a supposedly terrible reciever core and yet he got over 4,500 yards last season... What did Pennington do? UPDATE: I'm downgrading him to a two. He's injured way too much and lost something on his arm because of it. I think his career as a starter is over. It's unfortunate, because I liked him.
