A F is a great store. I always buy my jeans here. They fit so well. They have really cute tees too. The only thing that bugs me is that they AMBERCROMBIE on everything. Now, I realize that Ambercrombie is more targeted to high school kids. I am not a high school kid but I still am a sucker for the style. I just like it.
