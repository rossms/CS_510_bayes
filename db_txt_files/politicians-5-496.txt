A wonderful, great man. I have so much love and respect for him. Strugled to free South Africa and always stood up for what he believed in. One of the greatest leaders of the 20th century. If he is anti-America it is because he can see how much damage the American ideoloy is doing to the world, with its bloated consumerism and greed. He did a great deal for Suth Africa and made the West wake up to the evil that was apartheid. All of you who criticise him - did you lift a finger to protest about apartheid?
