Being from Southwest Virginia like JJ, I have kept up with his career since he was in high school. It's been great to watch how he has developed and improved his game. There is a difference between cocky and confident and I think JJ is the later. He is a great leader for the Blue Devils and he is never selfish. He lets his teammates shine in the spotlight as well. I love Duke and I love what JJ has brought to the team. He is going to be a great success in life.
