Anyone who thinks that Mark Richt is just an okay coach and doesn't have any control over the players on his team is an idiot and obviously doesn't know what they're talking about. Mark Richt is one of, if not THE best coaches in the country. You don't believe me? Watch Georgia win the national championship not only next year, but the year after that as well! Mark Richt is creating a dynasty at the University of Georgia. GO DAWGS!!!
