Aside from some of the artsy fight scenes, I did not find MI2 to be entertaining at all. Tom Cruise did not pull off the fighting scenes very well and I thought the story line to be rather trite. There were too many differences between the character of Ethan between MI1 and MI2. I thought that the story line could have been better.
