Del Taco is a jewel in the fast food industy in the sense that you can get full on less than 5 bucks. The Tacos are small, yet tasty, their beans are actually REAL, unlike the goo that Taco Bells serves, and they combine two great foods..Fries and Tacos. Whenever I go to a place that has del Tacos like southern california, I make sure I go there on more than one occasion. So they're definitely the best combination of being cheap yet tasty. Luckilly they're expanding, so perhaps one day they will come to my town.
