I have just finished my course work for a PhD in Education. I have two undergraduate degrees and a masters degree from traditional universities. I have found the course work and research more challenging and of higher quality at Capella than at any of the other institutions I graduated from. No institution is perfect, they are run by people, and people are not perfect. However, at Capella you actually have the chance to get out what YOU put in. I reccomend Capella to any highly motivated person who wants educational and personal advancement.
