The show is an authentic variety of hula-the way it should be seen! It is focused on the simplicity and beauty of the hula without all the Vegas style glamour and hoopla. If you want to see hula performed in its true form, this is where to see it! Authentic costumes made exactly the way the where 150 years ago. Its a elegant rendition of Hawaiiana as it should be!!
