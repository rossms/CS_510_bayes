I actually enjoyed this movie even though I am not a big fan of Westerns. Alan Ladd gave a superb, understated performance as Shane, the ex-gunfighter who helps the Starrett family fight against an uncaring rancher. Brandon De Wilde was excellent as little Joey Starrett, who hero worships Shane and develops a connection with him. The setting of the movie was breathtaking. The Grand Tetons of Wyoming loom over and dominate the frames they are in. This movie is worth watching as an excellent example of the Hollywood western.
