Alex is a great baseball player. He must be worth all that money considering that Texas accually gave him the offer. If he wasnt worth it then why would they give it to him? Yeah i do love seeing him in my home town (Seattle) but its good that hes going to another team. He can just see how much hes gonna miss it here. Besides, not like I cant see him when he plays here(Apr. 16,17, 18) and when hes on ESPN! Over all hes still all that!!
