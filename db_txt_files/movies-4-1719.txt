Top film. Throw the plot out the window and concentrate on machine guns, grenades and helicopters without any moralising or rationalising about what happened or why and you've got a successful war movie. It looked to me like a bit of an advert for the US Military with the Ranger and Delta boys mowing down the skinnies with impunity and dying noble, heroic deaths. The machismo is so overwhelming that one almost forgets that the Americans actually got their posteriors kicked. But still, you can't go wrong with a 2 hour battle scene.
