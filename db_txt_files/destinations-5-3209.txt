A great city in California, although the city itself isn't as good as the suburbs. I agree, the beaches are okay, because although they can be quite pretty the water can be cold. And some are cleaner than others. But San Diego's true attraction is our weather. Sunny and warm all year round! The winters are about as mild as you can get! Also we have a zoo that is world-famous for their work with endangered species. One of the few hitches is that it is extremely expensive to live there, since the number of people traveling there has increased.
