After 4 weeks, this Eagles' fan is now thoroughly convinced that T.O. is the real deal. He has 8 TD catches in just 4 games. That's super. When criticized about doing sit-ups in the end zone, T.O. replied, If they don't like my antics, keep me out of the damn end zone. That's classic. If McNabb, Westbrook, T.O., and Kearse stay healthy, Eagles win the Super Bowl.
