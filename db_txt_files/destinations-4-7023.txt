I kinda liked it, Oxford street was cool, but it was kind of expensive. And there were homless like-everywhere. That I did not understand. What is it with the londoners? They only care about money and themselves. And FOOD. Come on, get over yourselves. Yet, it s a beautiful town. Maybe I ll see you around, next time?
