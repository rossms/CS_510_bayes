Disney World was exciting for me at the age of 18 as it was when I was 8. This is truly a magical place to me..yeah yeah, I know..commercialism, major corporation, all they want is your money..whatever..let me live in my dream world. Disney World has the ultimate thrill rides (Space Mountain, Tower of Terror etc..) as well as fun rides for all ages (haunted mansion, It's a small world). The park is incredibly clean and the staff is very kind and courteous. This is the ultimate dream vacation for people of all ages.
