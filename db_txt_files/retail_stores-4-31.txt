I'm no book junkie, but I have to say that Barnes and Noble almost always scratches that rare itch I have for books. As other comments have noted, the atmosphere is pleasant and the selection seems all-inclusive. Most importantly for me, there are plenty of books on sale (hard and soft back). I must qualify my rating a bit in that I have never used Barnes and Noble as a library, coffee shop, or music source, so I cannot say if these features are of any real value.
