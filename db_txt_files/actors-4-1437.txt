A wonderful actor, but does tend to play the same guy, ie. himself, alot! However, he is so entertaining to watch he gets away with it, unlike Tom Cruise, who plays the same guy, and goes through the same mannerisms, and does that look up from down under, I'm getting angry now look in every freak'n movie, that it becomes so tedious..... but I digress! Nicholson, yes, fun to watch!
