Israel is such a wonderful and beautiful place. For a such a small country, there is so much diversity in terms of what it has to offer. It has some of the most historic sights in the world, beautiful beaches, great hiking, and even areas to ski. To visit Israel as a Jewish person is truly a life-changing event. You can't help but leave with a greater appreciation of your Jewish heritage and faith. The real crime of the current conflict is that it is sure to hurt tourism (one of Israel's biggest economies). Of course, that is exactly the reason that people must still make every effort to go.
