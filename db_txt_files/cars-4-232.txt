Ive got a 03' and to be ohnest if you ride it hard it needs the usual mantainance that any high preformance bike needs. In the last month Ive needed to replace a rear hub and had to ajust the valve lash. As far an overall rating there fast, handle great, and out preform almost everthing out there. Oh and almost forgot I also replaced the tie rod ends.
