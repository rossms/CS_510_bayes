Yes yes yes this was very creepy ugh I can't believe I've seen so many of these freaking films. You see this is what peer pressure does to you and of course being a child of the eighties these films were coming out by the dozen. Man did this thing spook me out. It's kinda like a very twisted Boo Radley.
