Pretty hard not to like this kid. I'd like to wait a bit before putting him in the Hall though. Having said that, he is as potent an offensive force as exists in the game today, and on the basis of his career so far one of the best in many years. UPDATE: I see another idiot savant has joined the ranks of baseball reviewers. According to tim abell Pujols can't hit in a game. Try actually watching a baseball game before reviewing anything about the sport, pinhead.
