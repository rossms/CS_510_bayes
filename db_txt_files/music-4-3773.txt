angus mcpherson. it's Roger Waters who writes the lyrics and many of the tunes, not Dave Gilmour. Im not much of a fan of Floyd but this album is so loaded with atmosphere and is an object lesson to guitarists in how less is more. the 3 note riff at the start of 'Shine on..' has more impact than Yngwie Malmsteen's entire output.
