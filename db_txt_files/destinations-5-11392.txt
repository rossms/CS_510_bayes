Stunning mountain scenery that has to be seen to be believed. Even the most cynical tourist will be amazed. It has the highest paved road in America, it goes above the treeline, it's almost like your driving up into the sky. Bring warm clothes, even if it's 90 in Denver, it will be cold up here. Only negative, go early to beat the bumper to bumper traffic in the summer.
