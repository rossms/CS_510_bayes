Finally we got a team! They aren't gonna be called the Expos for long though, as alpepper mentioned. They'll probably change the name back to the Senators or Nationals, or maybe the Potomacs (as in Potomac River), Macs for short :-) . They also might change the team name to the Grays, as a tribute to the old Negro league baseball team that played in DC, the Homstead Grays..... Actually I would've liked Virginia to get the team, since the Commonwealth doesn't have any sports team of any kind, but oh well. Folks in Virginia can root for the new DC team, just like they do for the Redskins
