Certainly one of the most beautiful cities i've visited,in a lovely setting,with an attractive stretch of river, surrounded by glorious countryside,filled with elegant and ornate buildings,fine quality shops and cafes,horse-drawn carriages,and beneath an impressive castle.In a week of miserable weather,even worse(torrential downpours) at Salzburg itself on the day we visited,it was still the highlight of our holiday.Handily placed for trips to Italy and Germany,i'd say it's a pretty essential destination,whether you're a fan of Mozart and The Sound of Music,or not.
