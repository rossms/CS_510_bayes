This list is about his acting abilities, not his political opinions. As far as his acting goes...it is very below average and the only thing usually worth looking at while he is in a movie is his awesome body as he is very attractive, or at least he was years ago. I will make a comment about his politics...but a very short one...and that is just that he has every right to his own opinion as an American as the next person as long as he isn't breaking any laws in the process...
