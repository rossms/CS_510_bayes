As the other raters have commented, Davidson is not the place for everyone. However, it is an excellent school with some of the most dedicated, talented and personable students, faculty and staff of any school in the country. Despite what most people think, it participates in NCAA Division I athletics, but the athletes are normal students like everyone else and not semi-deities as they are at some other nearby schools. If you're looking for the personal attention that only a small college can offer, all you need to do is take a walk on this beautiful southern campus and you'll be sold.
