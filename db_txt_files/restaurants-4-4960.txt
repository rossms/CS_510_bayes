Olive Garden is by far one of my favorite americanized italian restaurants around. I say americanized, because my grandmother was full italian, and I know what real italian food is, and even though Olive Garden doesn't quite make it, it is still far superior than most other chains I've been to. Their salad and breadsticks alone are worth it to me.
