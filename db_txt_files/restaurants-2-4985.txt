While I've only dined at the Olive Garden a few times, I must admit that I have not been impressed. As other comments have noted, one does get their fill of breadsticks, but a restaurant is measured by its entrees. The menu does offer a decent selection, but the quality just isn't as good as its competitors that have a shorter menu (eg the Macaroni Grill). I can't complain about the service, but I have seen roaches climbing on the walls near my table. The bottom line is that while one can't expect real ethnic food at a chain restaurant, the Olive Garden falls short on two many fronts.
