The series starts off really well, the first few books are excellent, but after that is just gets terrible. The characters don't seem real to me, and none of them ever seem to be in any real danger at all. The bad guys have turned out to be a disappointment, who are supposedly the strongest of their time, but they just seem rediculous.
