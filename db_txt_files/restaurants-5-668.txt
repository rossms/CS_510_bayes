YUMMY YUM-YUM-YUM! I love Krispy Kreme! I'm so glad they've decided to go national and have spread northward here to the Midwest. The first KK donut I had was deliciously warm, gooey, and soft. I was in heaven. Since then I've been hooked. The donuts are just great, with their fresh, straight-out of the oven taste and texture. They're not too greasy or heavy like other donuts, and don't sit in your stomach for three days like others. You don't have to be a Southerner to enjoy these tasty treats!
