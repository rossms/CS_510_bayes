This is one of my favorite candies. Its so smooth and creamy if you suck on it and is not too hard or soft. It crumbles nicely if you bite it, allowing it to melt better in your mouth. The flavour is hard to describe; I find that it is somewhere between a roasted marshmallow (which is basically a slightly smoky/intensified vanilla when you consider that marshmallows are made with vanilla) and caramel.
