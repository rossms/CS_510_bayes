Of the burger joints (pure fast food), Wendy's is my personal favorite when I'm looking for that. Since I'm wanting beef when I go to Wendy's, I can't speak to their chicken items, but I am always satisfied with the Double, biggie fries, and a medium frosty. The sandwiches are made to order (no heat lamps), and the fries are good (though not the best), and the frosties are filling and help counter the grease from the burger. Wendy's stays open late as well.
