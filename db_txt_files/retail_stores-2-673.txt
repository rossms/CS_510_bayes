The poorest quality of clothing next to a discount chain. I spend as much time taking things back as I do shopping there. Always good about returning stuff, but who wants to make two trips to a store to get it right? Just bought a shirt 4 days ago, has a rip in the collar, worn once, taking back today. Sent company an email, but do not expect a response. Good prices, but you usually get what you pay for.
