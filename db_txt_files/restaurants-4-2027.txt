As a kid, I couldn't stand Burger King. I loved McDonald's burgers, but the BK flame-broiling thing just didn't agree with my young taste buds. So for a long time my fast food world was limited to McDonald's and Wendy's. But somewhere along the line I gave Burger King another try, and to my surprise I really liked it. Their fries still weren't very good, but they changed those a couple of years ago and now they're much better. McDonald's still makes better fries, and Wendy's still makes better burgers, but BK makes for a nice fast food change of pace every now and then.
