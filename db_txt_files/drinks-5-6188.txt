As queer as this sounds, I prefer regular Coke to regular Pepsi...but when it comes to diet drinks, I think Diet Pepsi is better. I admit it took me a while to like it, it is definitely an acquired taste. But now that I am accustomed to it, I have trouble drinking Diet Coke. Diet Pepsi wins in this instance, in my humble opinion (and we all know how much the opinion of Dorkavitch Chamalsky accounts for). ;)
