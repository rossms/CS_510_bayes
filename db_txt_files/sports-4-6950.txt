 Larry Bird was not even the best forward ever let alone the 'best player' ever. Elgin Baylor would have eaten him for lunch. Even former Celtic Tommy Heinsohn said that Baylor was by far the best forward ever to play the game (and both Wilt and Oscar said he was the best *player* ever). Heinsohn followed by saying that of all the forwards that could be compared to Elgin Baylor (Bird and Dr. J were the 2 he metioned), he felt that Bayor was by far the better defensive player. --Vic.
