Reggie Miller is an awsome basket-ball player and need to receive more credit for what he does. I think he's one of the only NBA players that try their hardest and isn't in it for all the money. He holds a bowling charity every year. From what I've seen he has a great personality. He has good sports-man like attitude. How many basket-ball players can make the game winning three under all that pressure. Reggie has the best free-throw record at 92%. He is such an awsome player that's all I have to say
