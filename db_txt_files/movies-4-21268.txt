Saturday Night Fever was a total drag, but it's sequel Staying Alive will difinatly someday receive a good, cult following. Staying Alive unlike Saturday Night Fever is a ver campy, and funky movie, with John Travolta reprising his role as the dancer, who is now in a broadway show. It never got to see all of this movie, but enough to say that's it's a lot better then the original.
