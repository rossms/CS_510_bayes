The Links series, while steadily aging, are still the best games for a pure, unfettered golfing experience. While the graphics are very sparse with animation, lending a stifling, static feel to the game, the landscape imagery is top-notch. Each course seems maticulously re-created, and leaves you thinking you could find your way around the real thing. Plus the game physics leave nothing to be desired. On the whole, a fine virtual stroll around the links.
