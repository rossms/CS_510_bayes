I own a 1997 F-150 Lariet. The engine is smooth and has great top end. The transmission shifts too smooth and even seems to rob the engine of power. Other than needing mudguards over the rear wheels, the truck rides like a Cadillac. Ironicly, it rides smoother with a load. It corners better than my 93 Ranger. Good Job, FORD, but the 5.4 liter could use some more help in the low-end arena.
