Yes, very choppy and rushed. It didn't seem that true to the book. They seemed to play on everything but what Harry had troubles with - i.e. his dreams. It also seemed like Harry and Cho really weren't that well connected. I felt like Sirius Black had no place whatsoever in the storyline - except for his few moments of glory when he appeared in the fire. Needless to say, I was highly entertained by Ron throughout the whole movie.
