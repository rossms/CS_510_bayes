This is a great movie! True, it's dark and quirky in some areas, but Bridges plays a great freeloading bum as The Dude . I love Goodman's role as the militant but crazy, Walter. This was actually a favorite among a lot of Sailors on my ship during our WestPac deployment in 2000. I had to show it at least twice a week.
