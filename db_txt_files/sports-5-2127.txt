The Twins are a TEAM, stressing defense and pitching over power, quality coaching over rent-a-player superstars, and most of all, loyalty over payroll. Most of the team started together in AA ball. Team chemistry is off the charts and everyone on the field (and on the bench, with maybe 2 exceptions) is capable of winning a gold glove sometime in their careers. They are seldom out of a game, prone to late-inning rallies, and because of their recent success amidst the threat of contraction, are a great team to cheer for.
