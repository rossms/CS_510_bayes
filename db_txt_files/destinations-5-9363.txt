Ahhh this lake is so beautiful. The whole place is beautiful. I love Panajachel. It's so interesting to see how people live there, how they talk, how they dress, their foods ... When I was little I used to go there every summer and those were the best days of my life. I remember night walks on the rocks...w/a full moon. Beautiful. I recommend Antigua Guatemala, Amatitlan lake, and definitely Atitlan lake in Panajachel.
