Very well organized. Of course, O'Hare is a major hub for American, United and other big companies, so the place is bound to get crowded with transiting passengers. If I need to take a connection, I try to avoid Chicago as the stopping point, for it's usually delay-prone, either because of high-traffic or the weather, which isn't the best in the area many times
