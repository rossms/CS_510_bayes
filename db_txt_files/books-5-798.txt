This book was just as good as the original. I heard that some people (parents) think that Harry's character is a bad influence for children because he uses magic to get out trouble, but he doesn't- he uses his wits. To get to the Sorcerers Stone he had to use his mind to get through each new obstacle, and he had to figure out the last one, the mirror by himself. In this book, he had the help of the magic bird and sword to defeat Valdimar, but he had to figure out first HOW to use them. If anything, this character tells children that they must rely on themselves to get through bad times.
