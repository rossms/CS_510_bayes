I may just be another conspiracy theorist, but doesn't it seem an awful lot like Hillary bargained for a senate seat to not divorce Bill while he was in office? I mean, suddenly she's a Yankee fan? Suddenly, the Arkansas native wants to live in big, bad New Yawk? And I'll clue you in on something... I work in New York and don't know ANYONE who likes her or voted for her. Again, maybe I'm just paranoid, but... It kinda makes a little sense, don't it?
