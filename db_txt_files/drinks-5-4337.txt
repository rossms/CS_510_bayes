I never had it. I gave it 5 stars. I saw a bottle of this stuff at the party store yesterday they had two bottles one bottle for $46 and the other for $115 and this is for a 5th, for that price this stuff has to be heaven. To rich for my blood, I will be drinking Gentleman Jack and Makers Mark in hell I guess.
