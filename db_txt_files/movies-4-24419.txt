I cried when I saw this one buried deep within this list. Applause should be given here based on many factors: came out back when Disney was trying new things, did plenty with a no-name cast, retained a sense of humor throughout the histrionics, and cast a mood that sat you back in your seat at the multiplex. Recently released on DVD, I'll snag a copy for nostalgia's sake.
