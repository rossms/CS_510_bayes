Didn't like the base model at all (slow, kinda cheap), but I bought a 99 LTZ with 3.8, all options for less than $19k. THAT is a heck of a value. The seats could be more comfortable and the steering takes a little getting used to. The 3.8 engine has more than enough power. And get this, it costs less to insure than my old junky 90 Taurus! Good gas mileage (23 around town) and no problems.
