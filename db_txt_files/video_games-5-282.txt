This pinnacle of undead, three-headed-monkey word-dueling goodness has the distinction of being the only adventure game I'm more than happy to just watch someone else play, just to see the animation, hear the music, and listen to the witty banter. (A pity that I can't say the same of its 3-D sequel.)
