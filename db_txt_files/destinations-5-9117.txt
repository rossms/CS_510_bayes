Hong Kong is just plain fantastic in general. Victoria Peak is just icing on the cake. There are numerous stores and my money stretched so well there. I love the trading and batering booths that were all along the downtown streets. The people are friendly, and the food is great. The most excellent port visit in my Navy career!
