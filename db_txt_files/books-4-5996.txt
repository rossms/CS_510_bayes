I am hooked on Patterson's Alex Cross-Lullaby series of books. Sure, some of the descriptions are extremely graphic, but it is fiction after all. I would predict that 90% of those people who read this series will become very attached to Alex Cross. These books are quick reads, and real page-turners. You won't be able to put them down, and when you do, you can't wait to pick them up again. The chapters are really short, so you can read a couple of them while sitting on the toilet. The ending in this book was disappointing, but I am confident we haven't seen the last of the Weasel.
