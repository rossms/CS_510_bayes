A friend of a friend of mine smokes these and I wouldn't have noticed if I hadn't gone out recently only to find myself sitting next to him in a bar and him blowing smoke in my direction the whole friggin night. So having sat through that evening of second hand smoke I would like to say that this cigarettes smelled particularly distasteful!
