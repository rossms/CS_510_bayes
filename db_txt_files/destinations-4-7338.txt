A neat little fortress town which lies between Madrid and the Costa del Sol. The town is close to, if not more than, 2000 years old, and it's really interesting to see the influences of various cultural groups on the city including the Moors who apparently held Toledo for a couple of hundred years. It's definitely fun to wander around the narrow little streets within the town walls - a great place to bring a significant other, but don't expect a lot of nightlife.
