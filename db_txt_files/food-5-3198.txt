My husband and I found these frozen dinners about two weeks ago and that's about all we want to eat anymore. The turkey and gravy with mashed potatoes and green beans with cranberries is a special favorite. The chicken alfredo is also great, as is the pork chop with mashed potates, gravy and mixed veggies. Have tried a couple of others but can't remember the names and it would be too long to keep describing. All of them have been excellent! I was surprised that a frozen dinner could be so good and was very happy to make this wonderful discovery.
