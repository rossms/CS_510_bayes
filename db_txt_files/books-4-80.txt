Although Hitler wasn't a very likable man, his book was very interesting. And while most of his views were violent or didn't make sense, a lot of what he had to say made a lot of sense. For instance, when he talked about how teachers should teach History. How they should study why things happened instead of learning dates and stuff. This is an unlikable author but a great book and I recomend it.
