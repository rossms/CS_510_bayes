This was a very good book in it's own way, and a trilogy that very few people know of. As popular as Chronicles of Narnia series, and the Screwtape Letters, this is often overlooked. For what it is it's very enjoyable, and written by someone with a great grasp of the English language. Give it a chance if you are wanting some original sci-fi literature and can't decide what to read next.
