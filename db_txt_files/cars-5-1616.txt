I have had my little sentra for over 10 years. I've driven it to New York, Texas (2-3 times) Arkansas more times than I can count (I live in mid-Missouri), and a variety of other close and far-off places. The only thing deteriorating on this car is the outside. And, the most expensive thing I've had to do to it involved regular wear and tear (tires, muffler, brakes pads, etc.) I love it and hope to be able to drive it for another 150,000 miles without trouble (yeah...I'm a dreamer). I highly recommend it, particularly since I haven't made a car payment since 1994!
