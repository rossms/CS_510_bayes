Overlooked as a good actor. He's been overshadowed by peers like Robert DiNero, Al Pacino and Jack Nicholson. That's really unfortunate because Dreyfuss is a talent who can do a dramatic role effectively or can play it funny in a comedy. Down and Out in Beverly Hills was a very funny movie. Check out his movies and you'll see he's done some good stuff. Deserves to get a real plum role and shine in it and get recognized as a very talented actor.
