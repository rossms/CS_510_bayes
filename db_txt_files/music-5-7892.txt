I am sorry, but I am biased. Bon Jovi is my favorite band of all time, and I think everything they do is great. I have seen this video so many times that I can see it frame by frame in my head while I listen to the song. I love the black and white to color change, that is great. I like the end even more, when he flys! After I see this video or hear the song I am so happy for the next hour or so. I agree with john430et Bon Jovi can be so spiritual.
