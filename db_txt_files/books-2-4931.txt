Although I have greatly enjoyed novels like Jane Eyre, Wildfell Hall, Tess of the d'Urbervilles, etc, I could not even get halfway through Wuthering Heights. Heathcliff and Cathy were such a couple of whiny brats that I wanted to slap them. I had a hard time sympathizing with either one of them, and that's why I lost interest so quickly.
