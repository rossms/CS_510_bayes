One of the hardest things to do as a leader is make decisions that you know people are going to hate. Even if people won't admit it, it's obvious that he stands up for what he feels is right. He is also the first president to realize that the only way to deal with murdering terrorists is to take the battle to them. Take the battle to them. Put them on the defensive. And don't apoligize for anything. - Harry Truman
