The worst, least funny CGI film I've ever seen. The fact that it is being compared to Finding Nemo is an all-out travesty. The ending is painfully lame with the cookie-cutter everyone-coming-together-and-dancing-to-pop-music happy ending we saw in the Shrek movies. Except in this one, it's difficult to care about any of the characters (and believe me, there are plenty) we've spent the last hour or so with.
