I picked this up with low expectations at the airport as Nick Hornby was the only author that I saw that even mildly interested me, and I enjoyed it. As Teaseress says, this is hardly an important work - but it's a quick, fun read with some mildly touching parts. I could certainly relate to the selfishness of Will, but that's another story. About a Boy tails off dramatically at the end, I thought, but for the most part it is the perfect airplane book.
