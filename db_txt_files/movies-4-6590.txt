I saw this film a long while ago and didn't appreciate it. I perceived it as a prejudiced, sexist piece. Since I haven't seen it as a mature adult, I will bestow upon it a rating of 3.5 stars and simply state that it is on a level beyond the doldromous wasteland of modern American cinema. But she ain't no Kurosawa, neither.
