There are no great airlines. But Continental is a good airline. As a frequent business traveller (plus a couple of vacation flights a year) I've had poor experiences on all the airlines. But overall, I like Continental. The flights are usually on time, the employees are generally professional and courteous, the planes are clean, and the food is lousy but who expects better?
