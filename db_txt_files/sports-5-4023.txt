Not only the all time wins leader. But do any of you have any idea how hard that would be to do in the ACC? I understand if you are racking up wins at Marshall or St. Joes or somewhere, but to be the all time leader when you had to play out of conference games like UK, UCLA, AZ, UCONN, then you get in to conference play and face all the ACC power programs twice a SEASON! That's unbelievable! There are literally hundreds of reasons Coach Smith is the best. This just the one I felt like talking about.
