 I love Arizona and visit at least a few times a year. Unfortunately I never have had the balls to move permanently despite many close calls. I usually regret those decisons on January 8th when it's 20 degrees if not lower in PA. Thats when I buy the plane ticket and tell work I wont be around for a week or 2. One of these days I really wont come back. Tucson is indeed culturally more hipper than Phoenix but I also have some weird fascination with the redneck metropolis. I tend to hang out in biker bars on Thomas Rd or Van Buren.
