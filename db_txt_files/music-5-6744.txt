The year's most passionate album in my opinion. Formerly I felt this band was borderline Death Metal at times, now they have a well refined, sonic dreamy sound. Tracks I recommend are Knife Party, Feel Like More, and Change. This album is very personal and is very important to me. I'm often scared of the way mainstream music is going, but this saves me.
