I have visted Grand Cayman 3 times, twice we stopped for a few hours in the afternoon as part of our cruise, and later decided to spent an entire week to experence the island. The island is a little pricey but it has excellent beaches and freindly people. There are many great place to eat and of course you have to go to Stingray City.
