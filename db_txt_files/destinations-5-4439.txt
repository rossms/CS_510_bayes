I grew up in Des Moines and I hated it. But I've moved out nearly a decade ago and when I come back every year, I realize that it's really changing for the better. West Des Moines seems to be more of a hotspot than Des Moines proper, with all the expansion and new upscale malls and such, but if you want to look at a decent skyline come on down to downtown DM and see it for yourself - very underrated skyline and city in general. In short, an okay city with bigger things on the horizon.
