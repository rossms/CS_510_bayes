This was an okay close to the series. Hey you wanted a machine, human war, you got one. The graphics and stuff were really good, and I like the whole Smith flying-fighting scene. But... okay, the peace thing I thought was lame. Though I don't suppose it would've hit off with the public if the humans lost, and it woundn't make sense if the humans won. But couldn't they think of something better than machine-human peace?
