A very famous book which is often misinterpreted. Machiavelli is often accused of being immoral, even evil, but this is nonsense: he is honest, and his suggestions are literal, and AMORAL. So you wish to rule--if you desire to retain control no matter what, it is better to be feared than loved. This is true. He doesn't address the question of whether or not it is good or moral to retain control no matter what. At any rate, a magnificent book, and don't forget to study just what the Medicis, his employers, were really like.
