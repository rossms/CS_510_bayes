This is a GREAT Vehicle! I really enjoy driving my Bluestone V6. It's roomy, a great ride, I highly recommend it. It's like driving my Camry but I'm higher and can see more clearly! I highly recommend it. I am looking forward to taking it on a long trip this September. Great mileage. Try it, you'll fall in love with it too.
