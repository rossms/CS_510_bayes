Greatest showman of all time. Only Oscar was a better college player. Pete scored more because he had to. LSU did have two decent forwards but their center and other guard we poor and they had no bench. Loved to watch him play against UK. They would play box & one or other gimmick defenses and Pete would find a way to score time after time.
