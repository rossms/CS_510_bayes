A funny guy, that is not qualified to lead the country. He doesn't understand policy and we have to have a leader who can do that. His state legislature meets only every other year, and how do we expect him to work with Congress, which is a good old boys network? He will get nothing done, and that is bad for the nation. I thought about voting for Bush for awhile, but then realized it isn't about personality, it is about leadership, Gore is more qualified.
