This was not as funny as Dumb and Dumber , but it was still worth watching and was one of Carrey's best films. A lawyer who cannot lie... HA! That alone made the movie hilarious. A whole lot of memoriable scenes: The pen is blue..... the GD pen is blue , and I've had better. A great film- highly reccomended to anyone who enjoyed Dumb and Dumber or if you're just a Jim Carrey fan.
