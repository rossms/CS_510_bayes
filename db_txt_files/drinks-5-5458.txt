I love this stuff...proves as a great counterpart to Mountain Dew! It's like the Dew but they added cherry flavor that blends really well and it's just another great way to get your caffeine fix! I drink this stuff just as much as the original (which is also great)! I've also had Mountain Dew Blue Shock in Slurpee form, and it was very good as well, but Pepsi hasn't released this in normal form yet...instead they chose to go with the highly inferior Pepsi Blue!*gags*
