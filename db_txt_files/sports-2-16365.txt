Kelly Holcomb is way better. Losman has thrown 4 TDs and 4 INTs, completing about 50% of his passes in his short career, and hasn't really shown the decision making skills I'd look for in a QB. He might develop into a decent starter in a few years, but don't rush it. He got pulled from being a starter for a reason.
