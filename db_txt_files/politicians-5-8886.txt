Very good. He fixed many of the problems left over from the 12 republicans years. He fixed many things that Reagan and Bush messed up. And despite what many of you conservative bastards may believe he spent more money on anti-terrorism activities than most before him. SO DONT BLAM CLINTON FOR BUSH'S F**K UP!! The Clinton administration left Bush with a good anti-terrorism plan that Bush ignored. Bush the idiot son of an a$$hole had many many warnings of 9/11 before it happened yet he did nothing. Now all you conservatives blame Clinton. You are all so ignorant.
