I was expecting some big budget dumb storyline movie like deep blue sea......yet once the movie got underway I was pleasantly surprised. I have never been a big fan of Spiderman, never even read the comic, yet somehow I also knew of him. The stunts in this movie were amazing, as well as the visual graphics and although the plot was a little weak, it still entertained me right to the end. The choice of Tobey Maguire as Peter Parker is questionable...but he puts on a great performance anyhow. Surprisingly I am looking forward to the sequel.
