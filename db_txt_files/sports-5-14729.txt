As a football fan, you just enjoyed watching him play. Simply one of the best ever. I put him right behind Marino and Montana on my list. This generation was so lucky to have watched the play of Marino, Montana, and Elway. I think those 3 guys are the best ever. They simply elevated their teams level of play, well Marino and Elway more than Montana cause Montana always had a great team. Marino and Elway had many years in which they had little and they still made them respectable.
