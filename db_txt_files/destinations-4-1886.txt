First, let me affirm that most Americans don't have the limited world view that is all too apparent in the postings in this topic. Yes, we have obnoxious people and others less refined, but most American families can certainly be admired. Our history is that of valuing individuality and prosperity for all. We also typically appreciate and support other cultures. I sincerely believe that most visitors would enjoy experiencing our major vacation destinations (I especially like Orlando, Honolulu, Seattle, LA, NYC, and DC) and would feel most welcomed.
