Congratulations to the Boston Red Sox and Curt Schilling in particular, for an inspiring performance and an historic comeback, winning the '04 pennant. I hope Calvin Schiraldi and the rest of the 1986 team saw this last night. I've wanted it to happen for them for the last 18 years. And it's especially gratifying that they did it in New York City.
