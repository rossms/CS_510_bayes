Kathleen Turner was great in Romancing the Stone. If you're a Turner fan and you haven't seen that movie, you're missing out. And how sexy was she in Body Heat ? But she has also been in some really bad movies: Jewel of the Nile, Serial Mom, etc. Bottom line, though, is that she's a good actress, and, even more importantly, she's contributed her great voice to The Simpsons, which makes her OK in my book.
