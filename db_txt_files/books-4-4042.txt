Steinbeck is not the best author. The flow of the writing was not there in the book, but yet in many ways the Grapes of Wrath is the definining book of the Depression/World War 2 generation. It tracks the migration of a family from the Great Plains to California in search of a new life and jobs. The author has a tendency to ramble, but yet he captures the difficulty that Middle America faced during the Depression.
