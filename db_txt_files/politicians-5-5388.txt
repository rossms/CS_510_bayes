Al Gore may not have the charisma I wish he had -but if nothing else the man cares about the environment and will do something about it! Of course there is more to it than the environment and I personally would like to see the middle class get a tax break and not the 1% of the richest people, plus the values of the Democratic Party will prevail over the corporate subsidized Republicans if Al Gore wins.
