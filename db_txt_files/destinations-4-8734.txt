So many Skoal products that it is tough to give it a rating without breaking down the different things in the product family. Remember Skoal Bandits? I wonder if tehy still make those - so clean and no mess associated with those. 'A pre-moistened pouch' was the container for those - that just does not sound appealing to stick in your mouth though. The dip in the brown tin is great. Has just the right amount of flavor to it and it is strong enough so your head can take a loop. The cherry flavor is just wrong - tobacco should not be fruit flavored. But all in all, Skoal makes a good dip.
