Hpow can anyone not like the classic cookie with the white stuff in the middle? They are great for twisting and eating the inside first, or dunking in milk. I even dunked them in soda. It's not as great as you might think. I have even seen people eat them straight from the bag, no twisting or dunking! Seems unnatural if you ask me. A nice tall glass of Cold milk, a bagfull of Oreo's and I'm all set to watch a Denise Austin workout video. Watching her workout always makes me hungry!
