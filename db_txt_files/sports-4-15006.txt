There are some who have stated that activities off the field should affect a submissions rating. Although I tend to agree, there can still be no denying the greatness of a runningback nicknamed "The Juice". On the flip of that is the morbid thought, that if he could slice and dice another human being....then what was he capable of in a pileup. Wasn't aware that he only had 4 good seasons. That might explain his absence from the top yardage backs of all time.
