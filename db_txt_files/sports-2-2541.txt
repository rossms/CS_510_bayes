Look everyone jumps on the bandwagon and portrays this guy as the best GM. Christ, he hasn't proven himself on taking his team to the next level. They lost a lot of good talent (Mulder and Hudson) and it's gonna backfire against him, if not already. They're expected to finish last in the division this season.
