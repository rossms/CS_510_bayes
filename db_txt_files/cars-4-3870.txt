Nice, versatile, fun to drive vehicle. Beware however, a significant flaw in the design of the windshield which causes large cracks to develop spontaneously. My Element developed a BIG crack in the windshield while it was parked in my garage. Honda has refused to fix it so far. Bad form. Very disappointing and expensive. Do a google search under Honda Element Windshield before you buy this vehicle so that at least you will know what you are getting into.
