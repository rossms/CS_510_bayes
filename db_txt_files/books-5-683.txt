Three challenges face Potter in this book. Again, as in PoA, the events unfold around Harry, while he is pre-occupied with other mundane stuff. Only at the end does he get to preform his magic, attempting to save the world. Once again, Rowling has plotted a well written story that can appeal to both young and old. Well worth the read.
