As a New Jersey resident, learning that your governor not only cheated on his wife by having a gay love affair, but also that his adminstration was one of the most corrupt ones that have ever ruled New Jersey, you tend to be very embarrased. However, the one good thing that's come out of this whole mess is that currently, New Jersey is finally supporting a republican president, and I'm not embarrased by that!!
