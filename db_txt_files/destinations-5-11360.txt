Pictures simply don't do the Grand Canyon justice. You arrive at the edge and your mind can't quite catch the scope of the vastness of the place - and then you see a bird fly into it, and the scale becomes apparent, and your jaw just drops. It's a little crowded with people at times, but when it's quiet, there may be no more spectacular place on Earth.
