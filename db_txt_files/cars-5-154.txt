My new AC650 ROCKS!! I went out riding with some friends and way out performed a Sportsman700, two Grizzly660, and a Praire650. I had a sportsman before this AC650, the polaris is a great machine and I still have it, but the AC650 is amazing!! Each to his own, I've riden all of the big boys and the Arctic Cat 650 handle the hard off-roading conditions the best.
