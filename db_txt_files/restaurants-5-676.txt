AHHHHH I LOVE YOU SO MUCH! The chocolate covered ones make my mouth just water..ahh I'm starting to want one right now. Krispy Kreme is pretty much the yummiest doughnut place in the world. The doughnuts are never stale and always have just enough icing on them.... *Happy sigh* Okay, so now i'm really hungry.
