hinrich kicks ass and everyone here at ku is gonna miss him and collison like crazy next year. they were the heart of the team and have now passed their legacy on to Langford, Miles, Graves and Simien. . .also, I danced with Hinrich last night and it was great. . .even though he thinks he is a thug.
