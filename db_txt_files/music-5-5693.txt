Forgetting about all that Napster biz and that iffy documentary, 'MoP' is a classic album of the whole rock genre not just metal. In the 80s hard rock was all about blokes dressing up as hookers and ripping off Stones riffs. Then Metallica and other thrash bands came along and blew all that sh*t away..before grunge.
