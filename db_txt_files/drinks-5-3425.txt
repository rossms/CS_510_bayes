I too love TT and actually found it on tap in a 3.5 liter box at a liquor store in Rehobeth, Delaware ---just like wine! It is much cheaper this way and is much safer to take on a boat than the glass bottles. I haven't been able to find it in the box in Baltimore yet but am still looking. I am trying to find out the calorie content too since I have also gained a bit a weight. These things go down so easily that I am sure that I am consuming way too many empty calories but it is still better than having a hangover the next day.
