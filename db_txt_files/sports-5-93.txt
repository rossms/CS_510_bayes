Just passed Steve Carlton as all-time southpaw leader in strikeouts. Hitters must cringe facing a 7-foot dude with a 100 MPH fastball and Nuke LaRoosh-like control. Randy Johnson is a first ballot hall-of-famer. But if I had a Game 7, I would take Roger Clemens, or even Curt Schilling. I remember he was my #1 Draft pick in my Rotisserie league draft way back in 1989. Johnson got bombed in his first 3 games and got sent to the minors. But I guess my long range assessment was on target.
