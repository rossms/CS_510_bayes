I don't want to get beat up...but I'm generally not a fan of the Jay/Silent Bob duo. For whatever reason they just don't do much for me. So after my friends made me sit through Mall Rats and Clerks (which I fell asleep during) I had very low expectations for Dogma. This movie, however, is fantastic. Strong religious types, stay away, but for all others with a sense of humour in regards to religion, enjoy this one. The casting was great, I even found myself laughing at the moron twins.
