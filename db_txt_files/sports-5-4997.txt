There is no arguement that Pete Maravich is the greatest college basketball player of all time. In 100 years it will still be true. 3,667 points in 3 years with no 3-pt line. Nobody will ever come close to that. To average 44.2 points per game for a career is simple incredible. Besides being the greatest scorer, he was the greatest passer as well. Ask anyone who ever had the privelege of watching him play and they will tell you that he created life-long memories every game. To doubt Pistol's greatness is absurd and I can think of at least 3,667 reasons.
