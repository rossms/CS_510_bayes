The reason I give Sprint PCS such a good rating is that the quality of calls is so much better. I used to be with Cellular One and very frequently we lost calls to bad reception, but Sprint PCS' all digital network is always clear. Also, the payment plans are very easy and simple, and the coverage area I feel is much more vast than other services.
