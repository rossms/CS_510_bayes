 This 1998 Petite Sirah displays an intense ruby color which compliments the deep notes of blackberry found in the nose. Always a favorite in our line up for its rich fruit, this vintage is no different. The smooth and silky mouthfeel is integrated with a lush tannin structure giving this wine the perfect balance. -From the Bogle Winery web sight.
