I'm sorry, but no matter how cute and cuddly Gizmo is, this film isn't good. Gremlins 2 is litterally a rehash of the original, and when it doesn't borrow from it, it's pretty dumb. Zach Galligan Phobe Cates are fun to watch, but get obnoxious quite quickly. Gizmo deserved an oscar nomination, but the special effects here are awful. The ending will make you cringe.
