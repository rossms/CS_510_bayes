Simply incredible. I've been all over the world and I would say these mountains are among the most beautiful in the world, especially in Alberta. The glacial lakes are something else; Lake Louise and Moraine have some of the bluest water you'll ever see. The contrast with the tall mountains makes it one of the sights that can't be missed. A little crowded in the summer, but that doesn't take away the majesty of the place.
