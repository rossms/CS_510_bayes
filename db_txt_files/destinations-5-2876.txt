New York has more vibrancy than London. For this alone, it is probably worth the full 5 stars. Cloth-selection is better in London though, but still New York is up there for sure. There are, it seems, rough pockets that seem dangerous however and entering the hot clubs without a girl drapping your shoulder is near impossible. New York is a mess when it comes to taste with some of the nicest and ugliest architecture I have ever seen. I have been here 3 times now and it has never disappointed me.
