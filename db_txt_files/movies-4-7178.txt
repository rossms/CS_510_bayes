Another 80's classic. This was one of the first movies that I taped off of HBO on my family's old VCR and I probably wore the tape out. Chevy Chase is really funny as Clark Griswold who is obsessed with showing his family a good time on their summer vacation. Don't get me wrong...this movie isn't going to make you think too much. It's just pretty damn funny.
