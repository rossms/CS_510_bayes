Simply, thee best ale on the planet IMO. This ale has the best balance of malt and hops on the planet for my palate. This edges Sam Adams in my book, even though I gave that a 5-star rating also. If you want to taste the sweetness, you can. If you want to taste the slight hoppy bitterness, you can. Best to pour this into a glass and watch the frothy head emerge and STAY there, which tells you a good beer is in front of you. Seeing a Bass in the fridge always puts a smile on my face. Cheers to the Brits for making a great ale for 225 plus years.
