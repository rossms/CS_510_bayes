I liked this book a lot when I read it in the ninth grade. It is a gripping tale of racial bigotry and injustice, but I would hardly rate it as highly as most of the people here. It just simply is not as great as most of the books on this site. Maybe I just don't understand American psychology, but I didn't get the same thrill from it.
