I've heard seen all kinds of editorial statements about what Rick Santorum said recently that caused such controversy. But I never did hear what he actually said. Do any of you know where on the Internet I can find an exact quote, without any commentary? I'd like to see what he said before I make any judgments. I've searched already but haven't had any luck yet. Thanks!
