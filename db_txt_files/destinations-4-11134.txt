This place has improved from years ago. More nice hotels along the boardwalk, and the boardwalk had some events going on like kite contests, etc... Plenty of places to eat almost all year round, though you may have to drive slightly. The place seemed a lot dirtier and grungier when I went here in 1991, but in 2004, completely different. Beach had plenty of sand...was very nice. The stores across the street from the ocean aren't bad, but could use improvement. For NFL fans, plenty of places with NFL tickets to see games of your favorite team.
