As an art historian, I consider the Duomo in Florence as one of the architectural masterpieces of the Renaissance era. When I first viewed it from David's Park in Florence, it glowed as bright as the sun. The bronze doors of the church are considered the greatest feat of Ghiberti. Imagine creating relief doors out of molten bronze over 500 years ago. They are referred to as the gateways to heaven .
