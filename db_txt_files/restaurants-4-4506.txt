Home of the biggest burger I've ever fit in my face. Delicious to the max, and with all the fixin's for you to doctor it with. I never have the same burger twice, and I can't say that of Burger Fling or I'm Loathin' It. While McDonalds and other fast food will do in a bind, I'd rather spend a little more and get quality and flavor. That goes for the cheezy fries, too. :)
