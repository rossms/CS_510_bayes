The best thing I have ever seen her do is get killed in psycho. She became obnoxiously overrated during her bisexual fling with Ellen. I also find something about her looks that is slightly disturbing.I don't think she has the talent that everyone says she does to back herself up. Big deal...she's a tiny blonde woman. I've never seen one of those before!!!!! Homosexuality is not a choice...bisexuality is perhaps, but not homosexuality.
