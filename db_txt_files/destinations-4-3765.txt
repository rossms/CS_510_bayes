Pretty easy place to live, wonderful summers, easy to get connected. Winters not great, but not as terrible as parts of the Midwest- it doesn't get below 25 very often. Worst thing about town: long-term decay, decline and hopelessness resulting from decades of white flight and regional economic decline. But unlike other Rust Belt cities, people are at least aware there is a problem.
