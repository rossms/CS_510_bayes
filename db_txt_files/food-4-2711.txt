It seems like Oh Henrys aren't very well known in the states. Here, in Canada, they are everywhere and come in original, white, peanut butter and maple. I've only ever had the original - been eating it every since I can remember and I've always loved it. The thick toffee and fudge in the middle gives it a nice chew and the peanuts and chocolate are always good. Its kind of like a snickers with a denser center and a fudge layer.
