When it comes to rating Presidents, I rate them strictly on what they did in office, no before or after about it. Adams did lead a very interesting life, and accomplished a whole slew of great things before and after his Pres. term, but as President he left a lot to be desired. He rather ruthlessly stomped all over the Constitution with his Sedition acts, and his sour attitude at the time didn't help much.
