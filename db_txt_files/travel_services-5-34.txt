I fly from Newark Liberty and have been doing so since the age of five. I have been on many other airlines, but Continental is the only one I would give five stars to. The employees are all very friendly and kind, and contrary to what others are posting, Customer service is always good. Once I lost some luggage and they returned it promptly later that day. The quality of the flight itself is without a doubt excellent. Almost always on time.
