This is my favorate game of ALL time. It's great on both single player and multiplayer. You can also edit your own maps and it comes with a good bit of custom maps. There is excellent chemistry between the units and they offer a variety of different strategies. On multiplayer it is PURE FUN b/c you never know what'll happen. This game rules the RTS world.
