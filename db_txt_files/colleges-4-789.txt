I am currently six months into my PH.D. degree at Capella University and I have found the program both challenging and engaging. The pain of the high cost is somewhat dulled by the convenience of the program. I have thus far found the professors at Capella to be quite effective and knowledgeable. The writer of Capella Sucks sounds like he has a personal axe to grind--because of the self-discpline it requires, online learning is not for everyone.
