I am a huge fan of AE. I've noticed a few comments saying the clothes are cheaply made...they are not. Half my wardrobe is from there and the clothes have lasted well and long. The style is casual and comfortable while incorporating all the latest trends. As for the price tags...take a long around people, there are many many stores that are more expensive than AE.
