I'm not sure I understand the comments here, but for my money, The Pelican Brief was Grisham's best. Darby Shaw is a law student. Her lover/professor is a Supreme Court nut. Two of the justices are murdered. Darby prepares a brief. The bad guys find out. Darby's on the run. Kind of kitschy, but a real nail-biter. I like books that read wuickly, and this is one you just can't put down.
