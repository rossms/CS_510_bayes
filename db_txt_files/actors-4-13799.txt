I was a bit surprised to see her name so far down on the list, but not completely perplexed. This is one actress whose sudden popularity Hollywood over exploited. She is talented and pretty, but she needs to focus her acting skills into the making of a couple of great movies, such as Erin Brockovich, instead of the mass production of mediocre ones. I found her quite annoying while accepting her Oscar, okay, so you finally won yourself the big one, get off of the stage already, its embarrassing!
