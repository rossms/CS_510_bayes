Like any school, Cornell is what you make of it. Few can deny that it's an academic powerhouse; even fewer can make it through a long winter in Ithaca without feeling a little depressed. Yet, like any good comedy, the memory of the school seems to get happier over time, and one thing's for sure: you'll never regret choosing it over Harvard. Cornell is everything that the likes of Harvard can only claim to be: a renaissance school for the renaissance student.
