While Red Dragon comes close, this movie is by far the best in the saga. Jodie Foster adds significant depth to the role of Agent Starling, and Anthony Hopkins is excellent as Hannibal Lecter. This movie was made prior to the great grusome fest made by Ridley Scott, so you will find the gore toned down, and the psychological suspense turned way up.
