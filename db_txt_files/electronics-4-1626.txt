Excellent TV. I own one myself(CT31XF44). The picture out of the box is okay, but after calibration the colors jump off the screen. Easy to use on screen menu. Easy to set up. Lots of connectors on the back of the TV. Easy to hook up two cable lines, two VCR's and stereo outputs to a stereo receiver.
