Stop cleaning the floors while diners are eating. Keep those curtains washed-they usually have an 1/2 of dust on them. When you order a meat sandwich, there should be enough meat in it that you feel like you are getting your money's worth. Don't go in the middle of the afternoon-takes forever to get service-as has been my experience. Due to a bad experience today, I am off of this restaurant for a long time. They could have handled my bad experience there today much better-they chose not to.
