I really don't see any reason NOT to give him a 5. He wasn't quite as brilliant as Mays, and if the Braves hadn't moved to homer-happy Fulton County stadium had would NOT have broken Babe's record. Nonetheless he was incredibly consistant for a really long time.. maybe like a better Eddie Murray. With more speed.. and a better glove.
