As a kid, I think Fudge Stripes were my favorite cookies. Just enough chocolate without overdoing it. I remember eating 5-10 of these things at a time without missing a beat. I haven't had Fudge Stripes in a long, long time, but just thinking about them again is making me want to place a WebVan order right away...
