Anyone thinking of relocating here...don't! I am a 29 yr old married mother of two small kids and we are moving to the deep south...to escape the unpredictable weather(freezing winters that are 6 mo. long), the rude people, and the lack of cultural diversity and attractions...and I was born and raised here!
