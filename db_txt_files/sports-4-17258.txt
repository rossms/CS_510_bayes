I always liked the Boys, but it looks like they need to go back to the drawing board. They need a new young stud QB and in a couple of years will have to replace Emmitt Smith. They pay a fortune for Joey Galloway, and he lasts 30 min before going down with a season ending knee injury. The boys will be back, but it will take 2 to 3 years.
