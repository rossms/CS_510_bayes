Bill Russell was an incredible rebounder and defensive player, a good passer, and a mediocre scorer. He was a fierce competitor, and 11 titles in 13 years is unreal. However, to say he was better than Wilt or Kareem because of the titles is like saying Larry Siegfried was a better guard than Oscar Robertson because Siegfried won more titles. Or like saying Bernie Williams is a better player than Barry Bonds because the Yankees have won more championships. Russell was great, but he takes a back seat to Wilt, Kareem, Hakeem, and Shaq, in the ranks of all-time great Centers.
