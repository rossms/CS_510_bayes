I think that Heath Ledger is a good actor, and he sure is nice to look at. He's hot!!!!! I thought he was really good in the Patriot and 10 Things I Hate About You, but those are the only movies I've seen him in. I think he's very promising, and he's got alot of talent. I think he needs more opportunities to show it.
