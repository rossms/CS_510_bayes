I rated it a 2 because I like the idea of a new, different taste. But a sweet carbonated based prune juice? Come on, be more reasonable. If you drink too much you can get a stomachache. Prune juice is left to the old people, that's why not a lot of young people go for the drink. It makes us feel old and we don't need that. It also happens to be in a purple can, like I'd feel masculine holding that can.
