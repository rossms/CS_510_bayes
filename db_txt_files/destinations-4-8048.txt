Nice statue, made famous by the opening scenes of Hawaii 5-0; I have been there during King Kamehameha Days in early June and watched them decorate the statue from top to bottom with leis, nice to watch,many families come to watch the ceremony. I believe that June 11 if King Kam day, and that week they have all sorts of celebrations in Honolulu and finally have a wonderful parade that snakes it's way from downtown thru Waikiki to Kapiolani Park. Wonderful parade, beautiful floats, beautiful flowers on everything, even each island's royal courts horses!
