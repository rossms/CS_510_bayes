My experience at Tulane changed my life. I truly lived in one of the most amazing cities in the US for 4 years and gained a top notch education at the same time. The student body is from all 50 states, tons of Latin American students, and quite a few french kids! Amazing opportunity to live in a quasi-European city with Americans from all over and a big dose of interesting non-natives!
