Came for an OSU football game, left with a genuine fondness for the city. Suprisingly abundant choices for good restaurants. If time permits a visit to the OSU campus is a must. Fantastic scenery and wonderful architecture. Seems like a little city in itself. Don't miss High St., The Oval, or Mirror Lake. Columbus is a fairly large city with a small town feel. Looking forward to returning some day.
