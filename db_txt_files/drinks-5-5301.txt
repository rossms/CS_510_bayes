Next to Coke, best soft drink ever... in fact, I might even like it more than Coke. Hopefully when you try it... just don't expect a carbonated lemonade-type drink. While it DOES taste citrus-y, the specific fruits it's supposed to taste like (lemon? lime? pineapple? grapefruit?) is a mystery, but unlike many lemon-lime drinks, the citrus taste IS there! Quite good, I may add!
