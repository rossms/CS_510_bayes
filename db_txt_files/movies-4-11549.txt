This movie is what inspired the likes of American Pie, Can't Hardly Wait, etc. Even though the film wasn't intelligent by any means, it has its place in movie history, and I happen to enjoy it occasionally. Ms Ballbreaker is hilarious. UPDATE: If I remember correctly, isn't the first Porky's about HIGH SCHOOL students? I don't remember any college students in the film at all? I think they are in college in the sequels, or one sequel? Maybe CTVFan is talking about the sequels? Not sure...???
