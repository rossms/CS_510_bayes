I have been drinking Stella for 12 years now and i have never found anything better!!!! Being in the forces i dont know anyone that doesnt like it! Even my girlfriend now recognises the taste between lagers and wont have anything apart from Stella!! It never seems to make you that ill that you never want to touch it again like some drinks. Someone that thinks Stella tastes like piss is someone that says 'strong lager' when the barman asks what lager they want!!!!! NOTHING BETTER IN THE WORLD!!!! ( ive done 33 countries so tried a few beers!!!)
