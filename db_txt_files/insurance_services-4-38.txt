I have been a customer of State Farm for over 10 years now. I have my house insured through them as well as my automobiles. I have made claims on both homeowners and automobile policies and have never had a problem getting things covered. They have been very helpful in geting repairs done on time for me. I would give them 5 stars if they were a little bit cheaper than what they are. But at least they are alot cheaper than any of the other companys that I have used in the past (AAA, Citizens and Allstate).
