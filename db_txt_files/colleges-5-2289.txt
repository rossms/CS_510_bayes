After graduating from MSU 83,88, and 95 I found that what my fraternity brothers said years ago applies... you get out what you put in. MSU offers a lot for those who want to make it a positve growing experience. I had the degree of BS,MS, and PhD confered upon me from MSU and have traveled the world because of the eduaction that MSU provided me.
