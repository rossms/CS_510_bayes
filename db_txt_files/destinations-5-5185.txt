It is the greatest part of america hands down, getting abit crowded in parts but still lightyears ahead of any state in any way.... However Hawaii is an apple's to oranges tie. Nagging about Political views and LA(as bad as it may be, it is still far better place to put up with than any other city of its populace in the world) is mearly a testiment to how far people have to reach to find something tangibly wrong with California; People bitter with their own territory in life more often than not.
