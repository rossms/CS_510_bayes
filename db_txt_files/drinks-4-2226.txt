Cane sugar, lemongrass, and spearmint drown the green tea's bitterness with an almost syrupy sweetness. I thought it even tasted a bit like honey (though it doesn't contain any). At 120 calories per 14 oz bottle, this drink has nearly as much sugar as many popular soft drinks (a 12 oz can of Coke has 140 calories). If you like more popular brands of non-diet iced tea, you probably won't be disappointed by Tazo's Iced Green.
