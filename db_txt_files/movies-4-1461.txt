good but extremely violent. Uma Thurman plays the bride who was supposed to be dead but survived an attack at her wedding. she is in a coma for four years and then vows to kill the enemies that betrayed her. A lot of martial arts if you like that kind of movie. well done but as I mentioned before very violent.
