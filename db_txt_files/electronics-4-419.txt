It is a good DVD player, but I have had some minor problems with it. For example, certain discs might not play, like the movie Play It to the Bone. I was told in the the Hollywood DVD store that it would play, but it didn't. Also, it very easily picks up scratches and glitches in the CD, which shows during the movie.
