I swear that the Cliff Notes (themselves 100+ pages) of Moby Dick are a compelling and brilliant read. I never would have made it through the terminally long book itself, but the CN's were so good I remember the book vividly even though fifteen years have passed. I also remember getting an A on the paper I wrote about the doubloon.
