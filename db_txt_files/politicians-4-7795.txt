The first President to fly in an airplane, own an automobile, and dive in a submarine.. He never touched liquor but drank a gallon of coffee per day.. Renamed the "Executive Mansion" the "White House" and added the "West Wing".. A conservative who fought for reform, a hunter who started the conservation movement, and a hawk on war who won a Nobel Peace Prize.. As much a Democrat as he was a Republican. He believed that he represented the people and not a particular political party. An extra star for that.
