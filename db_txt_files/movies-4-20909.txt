i normally dont like musicals..but this movie was awesome. loved it. the music was out of this world. nicole kidman and mcgreggor can sing really well.all of youll who havent seen this movie ull gotta watch it..the plot,music,acting is all fabulous.the ending was really good too. heart breaking.. one of the best romantic movies ive ever seen. the costumes,music,sets etc gave such an amazin effect. everyone acted fabulously.
