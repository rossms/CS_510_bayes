I've had my car for about 2 years now and the most I paid for maitenance was like a 150 dollar tune up. The gas milage is great (35 mpg) and it has always started. It still runs great, even after the time I practically ran it dry on oil. I've taken it on a few road trips and it has performed fine. The handling is great, but the power is a little lacking. That's my only complaint...but...what do you expect with a 4 cylinder engine? Bottomline: Great car.
