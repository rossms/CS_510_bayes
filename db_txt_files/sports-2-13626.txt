Joe Gibbs is a horrible coach. His play calling has cost our losing at least 3 games including today against the Chargers. He plays "chicken ball" and it has come to bite us in the "U No What". When Brunnel is playing well, let him continue to throw and stop changing things back to the running game when our lead is so marginal. Joe needs to go back stick with NASCAR as he is not willing to join the 21st century...................Our team plays its heart out and Joe causes the losses everytime with his stupid play calling.
