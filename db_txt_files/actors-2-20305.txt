She is an actress right? Why doesn't she do it right. She overdoes her role on Friends, and it just pisses me off. She acts like a little eight year old girl instead of an attractive, intelligent, and respectable young woman. I really wish she would play more mature roles, because she can only do the Friends thing for so long.
