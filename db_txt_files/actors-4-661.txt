I will always remember Walter Matthau as the grouchy sourpuss. I usually saw him in movies with Jack Lemmon. Walter Matthau was a good actor. I liked him in the Odd Couple as the sloppy Oscar Madison, Most of his characters were similar, Grumpy, Not too good with patience, etc. yet usually his characters also had a soft side to that grumpyness.
