We have had the TMobile Fmaily plan for 3 years and I have to say we are please. Unfortunately we are moving from Chicago to Charlotte and they don't have service in that area. Customer Service at TMobile has always been excellent. We do experience call drops all of a sudden; our phones just shut off, so I don't know if it's TMobile or the phones we have. We have been offered deals where if we buy a new phone we get a month's credit in 6 months and have never had to fight for it...it just appears on our bill. Overall I think it's great. Too bad they aren't in Charlotte.
