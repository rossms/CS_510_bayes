This is n my opinion one of the better sights in Prague and is worth a visit. The whole castle complex has an interesting history. It is well maintained and clean, and affords some great views of Prague itself. I was somewhat put off by the comic opera uniforms of the Czech honor guard at the main entrance to the castle.
