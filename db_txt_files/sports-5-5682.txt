Chris Paul is an excellent basketball player, with a somewhat good heart. He's ranked 4th among all guards, averaging 15 points per game, 5 rebounds per game, almost 7 assists per game, and 2.5 steals per game! He is the backbone of this Wake Forest team. What would Wake Forest have done without him at NCSTATE? His basket at the buzzer was awesome!
