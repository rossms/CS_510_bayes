This was a good book. I thought, however, that it did stop being a children's book when Frank died. Depending on the age of the reader it could be very disturbing to a small child's mind. I thought it was good to leave open a mystery at the end sort of the hook that makes you want to find out what happens next. This will make people want to buy and read the next book right when it gets out.
