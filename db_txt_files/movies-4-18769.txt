I had to give it four stars because it scared me so much. ^_^;;; Oddly enough, I went to see it with my father, who has been a correctional officer for over 20 years and has been held hostage, and is a two-time blackbelt. He said this movie creeped him out, so you can pretty much conclude from there... If you have an imagination, this movie will terrify you. If you don't think it's scary, then you've been playing video games too long.
