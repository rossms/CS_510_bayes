Everyone will try and bash Torre because he's got the deep pockets of Steinbrenner, but nobody seems to remember him winning with a rookie SS named Derek Jeter and Andy Pettitte, a before his prime Bernie Williams and your good but not super stars Tino Martinez and Paul O'Neill. Just because Torre has all that talent now doesn't mean he couldn't manage well if not BETTER without all the big egos and distractions.
