Sadly, these are off-limits to vegetarians due to the gelatin content. I remember always making sure the white sugary side was face-down on the spoon so it would be the part to touch my tongue. I think the wheat side is just a feeble attempt to make this cereal look healthy to some degree. They should just go ahead and sugar up both sides!
