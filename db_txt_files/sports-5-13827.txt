I don't think that I've ever heard anyone utter a single negative comment about this guy. He was as tough as nails and he gave 100% of his effort at all times. A total class act and one of the finest people ever to play professional sports. Take note Terell Owens; This is how a real man carries himself. I wish that we had more like Walter Payton. Oh yeah, and he was a pretty fair runner/passer/receiver/blocker too.
