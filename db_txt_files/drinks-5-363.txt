Sam Adams is my favorite widely avalaible beer. Can't really say why, I just like the taste. Not too think like a Guiness, not too much after taste like a Maredsous. Just nice and smooth. Having said that, I will not, under any circumstances, drink an American pilsner like a Budweiser, Coors or Miller Lite. Any beer that is cheap at a bar, I won't touch.
