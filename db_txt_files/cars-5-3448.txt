I drive a 2-door -96. I very agile vehicle.Fun to drive. Girls turn their heads after it - I like that. Extremely reliable. So far 96.000 km with just regular maintenance. No repair cost. I drive economically and get 26 mpg in winter, 28 mpg in summer. This is not a offroad vehicle as there is no low gear but operates greatly on anything that resembles a road or track. A bit noisy - later versions are better in that respect.
