It is an excellent drink if you are ordering off of the kiddie menu. Otherwise, keep your dignity and order a plain soda or a Non-Acolholic beer if you don't want to drink. Why a grown person would order a Shirley Temple is beyond me. Why are they called Shirley Temples anyway? What is that all about?!
