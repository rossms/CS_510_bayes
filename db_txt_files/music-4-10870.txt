I like Madonna's latest look and musical style. I for one am glad to see that's she back to her old self after going through that weird phase with Ray of Light, which didn't seem to fit her image and probably alienated many fans. The title track is by far the best on the album although there are other great tracks on Music such as Don't Tell Me and Amazing . Its hard to believe that its been 18 years since Madonna first burst on the scene in '83 and that she still has the ability to top charts around the world. I wonder she has in store for her next album.....
