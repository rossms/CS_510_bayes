I have had the pleasure of owning 2 Mercurys/ the first a 1987 i bought in Florida, and it was mechanically wonderful, air worked forever, only problem was the paint job. I called it a Monet paint job. It was blue with bits of primer under chipping. Sold it and bought a 1998. Wonderful, beautiful, people think it is a Lincoln or a Lexus. makes me feel perty good. Comfortable and Handles fine.
