I have to say that much of reggie's comments are commical. due to my job i have traveled across the country, from Iowa to Florida. Until then I never realize how hated he was. I have to say that the greatest flatery is hatred. reggie has done things that will never be done again. Given in many games he is a only a star, but lets be honest whether you like him or not 8 points in 8 seconds will never be duplicated again. he has pulled off feets only imagined by children, because when you grow older reality takes hold. Thank You Reggie, Thank You for giving us such excitement, and victory. Chris in Anderson
