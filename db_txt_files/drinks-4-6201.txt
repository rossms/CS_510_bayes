I prefer Pepsi Vanilla over Vanilla Coke anyday. Pepsi Vanilla has a stronger vanilla flavor over Vanilla Coke and as a result makes you feel like your actually tasting the Vanilla. Now use some common sense, I'm sure most people would agree, Pespsi Vanilla has a stronger flavor then Vanilla Coke, so I guess Coke is putting less vanilla in their drink, and there's a 99 percent chance that's to save money. So, I guess Pepsi spares no expense to provide a better taste for it's customers, at a lower price.
