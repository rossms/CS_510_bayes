Derek is a great role model for guys.. read his book.. for all the young men in the world, watch how this guy goes to work. You can bet he enjoys his life.. and he knows he doesn't have to hit for the most power.. one thing I don't get is how people think he's not talented.. he's immensely talented.. he just doesn't necessarily hit over 30 homers a year but he's a lead off hitter.. it's not his job to hit for power! Also, he's fast as lightning and if he wanted to, could steal way more than 30 in a season
