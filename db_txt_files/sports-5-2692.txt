How can you even think to say that this man hasn't changed the way the Yankees play MLB? He comes into this ball club in 1996, they win the world series. In 1997, they make it to the post season. Then from 1998-2000 they were World Champs. He makes all the right investments, all the right moves. He really helps that club and made New York once again the capital of the MLB world.
