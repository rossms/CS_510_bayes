I'm sorry for the bad taste of Reign32 and Faliodo. They must like Barcardi better, but to each his own. But Tekky1 and elvingt you guys know what good taste is. I'm from Puerto Rico and like elvingt says, they don't even bother with the US market they make enough $$$$ on the island. But, sometimes I wish they come to the US market so that they can show how good they are. Only one recommendation to any one that goes to Puerto Rico for vacation, buy Don Q, I think you woun't be dissapointed. Also, try their 38 reserve, it's even better. (Let's hope I got the name right)
