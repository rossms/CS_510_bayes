The plot of the movie is totally unrealistic. People with no education cannot fly jet planes in one week. That's completely impossible. The graphics are cool like how the alien planes fly in and out. Actors were simply too fake. There was no karma between them. Overall, the movie sucked, and I don't recommend it.
