This city is WAY underrated. I lived there for a couple of months and found it to be a kick-ass place. Tons of history, museums/culture etc., the nightlife is great, you are in a great location to take road trips to a lot of the other little towns (San Miguel de Allende, Taxco, Acapulco, etc), and a pretty green, beautiful city as well. Plus the food is outstanding, as is the beer. If you get a chance, try Indio and Victoria beers, they blow Corona away.
