How in the world can such a great song not bring forth any other good ones. at least any other good ones in the US. With the release of their new album this month 4/2002, check it out btw...maybe this one will have a chance to be released in the US. perhaps if all the albums had been released in the US they would have had more popularity. of course MTV and the video of Take On Me made it even more successful. Nevertheless, MTV hardly ever plays videos anymore. so its a wonder that anyone gets any publicity at all other than the TV. Simply put, Take one me is brilliant, poppy and can you say SOOOO 80's!!??
