Written with verve and permeated with a subtle irony always catching its target, "White teeth" is maybe the best debut work I've ever read. Zadie Smith is wonderful in drawing her characters, in painting their peculiarities in a sarcastic way, but never passing the line of the caricature. In few words she's able to stay suspended on the verge of a precipice, never loosing her perfect balance. http://utenti.lycos.it/simonabusto
