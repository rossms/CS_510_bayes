you can tell who the true riders are by reading some of these opinions,I too have rode many brands of bikes and I can prodely say, none hold a candel to a Harley.I own a 1986 sportster and it has over 60000 miles on it.it doesn't leak,starts when I need her to and If she could speek it would be in English.Advice to any one looking for a bike specially a new rider,buy yourself a sportster,the price is right they will hold a good trade in or resale value.and remember this when shoping for a bike,its been all the other junk/motorcycle companys imatating Harley not Harley imatating them.
