As a child I enjoyed reading all of the Laura Ingalls Wilder books. How lucky to get to read books written by a person who grew up in the Pioneer days. Not only did I love reading about Laura's life with her family in the 1870s{approx}and her encounters with Nellie Olsen. I found myself learning a bit about history. Laura books taught me about what life was like during that time period. Living in a log cabin, how poor they were. and just what pioneer life was like.
