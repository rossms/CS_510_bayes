I really liked this one.The subject is SO actual now,with that wierdo Eminem (I would like to ask this question for the 1000-th time:What is he so angry about?)So,for me, this movie was about making fun of people like Eminem or Vanilla Ice.I love the concept.Acting and script is not very good,but it doesn't need to be.I think there is a little of Kennedy's character in all of us,it's called snobbery.This is another great thing to be comically criticized.Great fun,doesn't try to be a great film,it is relaxed, I loved it, so it deserves 4*.YeahYeaheeee!
