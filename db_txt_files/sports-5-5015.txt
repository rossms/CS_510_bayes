Oscar was the best. Did it all; scored, passed, rebounded, played D when he needed to. And an absolute killer. Give him an open 20 footer he would move in and take a 15 footer, and open 15 footer and he would move in and take a 10 footer. Give him the 10 footer he was making it a 5 footer, give him that and he was shooting a layup. He never settled.
