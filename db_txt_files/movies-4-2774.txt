I enjoyed it. Great action scenes (loved the Matrix like fight scenes), cool music, and hot women. The plot was pretty weak, as was the dialogue - but who cares. The movie flies by, and is completely entertaining. One interesting thing about this movie - every male character with the exception of scary thin man was worthless and weak. Girl Power Rules!
