Quaker Oatmeal is a classic. If you need a boost of energy in the morning, this stick-to-your ribs hot cereal is a great bet.

I always add either brown sugar or maple syrup and raisins to my oatmeal, making it even better. The best way to eat Quaker Oatmeal, though, is to prepare the cookies featured on the box. My mom used to bake them when I was growing up, and they were delicious. Just thinking about those cookies makes my mouth water...
