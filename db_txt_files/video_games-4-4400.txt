great graphic, good story, generally well done gameplay, amaizing cinemas, it's worth buying only for the cinemas, but unfortunately it's too short. i finished it after 6 days (playing non stop). baisicly, there were alot of expectations, and it didn't lived up to them, not because it's a bed game, the quality remained superb like in every blizzard game, but i think every body expected them to bring it one level further, but all they did was creating a hi tech full exploited version of the original one. anyway it's still a good game, i actually finished it more then once...
