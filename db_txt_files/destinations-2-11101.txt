Its not the ocean , it a lake , and lakes can get prety nasty and dirty sometimes and they smell unlike the huge beautiful ocean that smells good and has nice marine mammals in it like dolphins , whales seals , orcas , i miss it sooo much . But last time I was at this lake beach it smelled REALLY bad , but other times it did not , but still the ocean is 1000 imes beter i would rather swim there!
