This movie had a really worldly, obscene presance to it. Put it this way, when I first watched that movie at age 16, I thought, there must be something wrong with me, because my head wouldn't be so strong that if it got slammed into a wall, I would not only be OK, but I'd end up denting the wall. This movie was a bit overdone.
