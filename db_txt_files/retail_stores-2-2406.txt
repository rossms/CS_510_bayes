The store near me (in Canton, Mi) has terrible management. The store is regularly out of milk. They advertise things on sale, but their shelves are bear. Just today I went to buy a lemon, guess what they were out of lemons. When has a grocery store ever been out of lemons???....this is the worst run grocery store I've ever seen
