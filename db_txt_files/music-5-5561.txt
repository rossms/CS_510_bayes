AWESOME!!! The hardest rock that money can buy!!! After this album, things went a little down hill. Brian Johnson had a great voice back in the day, and he still tries hard (unlike some other singers) but his style of singing is taking a toll on his voice. Bon Scott, the one and only original, was great!!! I recommend this and all the previous albums to any fan of real rock! Rock on! Oy!
