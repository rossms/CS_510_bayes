Who can forget Number 6, my childhood hero? He was the best player on those competitive Dodger teams that were always battling the Big Red Machine for the pennant(s) in the 70's and early 80's. Hit for average and hit for power. NL MVP in '74. Definitely should be in The Hall. On a side note, about 25 years ago when I was a kid, he was very nice to me and went out of his way to sign my baseball.
