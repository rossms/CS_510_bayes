My Goodness, My Guinness! Guinness, Draught not the Extra Stout, is the smoothest beer on the planet. Some people say it's bitter, but if so, not very, because bitter is a term I usually reserve for cheap and/or spoiled beer. Guiness is nothing short of perfect by way of it's stout flavor and creamy texture. And not to mention the fact that Guinness is one of the greatest bonding devices known to man. A pint or two with a friend after work or school is one of the most deceivingly simple and best ways to unwind. Guinness is good for you!
