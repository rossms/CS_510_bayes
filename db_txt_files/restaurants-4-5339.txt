Friendly's is great!!!! It is sort of like a sit-down darry queen. Their ice cream is some of the best i have ever had, and all of there chicken dishes and their burgers are deliciouse and are reasonably priced. THEY DON'T HAVE ANY IN THE SOUTH!!!! Friendly's is one of many things that are making me look forward to getting back to new york
