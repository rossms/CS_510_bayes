A good, low-cost alternative to Adobe's Photoshop. Doesn't have all the extensive features. It crashes a little more often than Photoshop. The interface could use a total overhaul, but the advanced image editing features are there. Good for the employee who does small graphics on the side as a part of his work. Photoshop is a wiser investment for the employee whose whole job is image manipulation (along with Adobe Illustrator, et al).
