This is a new artist with something good to offer us. 1) A voice so good it can be compared to the top R B vocalists ever, like Whitney Houston, etc. 2) An original album that deals with real issues in young girl's lives. 3) A cool hairdo. She's not looking like our everyday pop stars and she's proud of it.
