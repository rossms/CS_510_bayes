This is one of my favorite movies of the year, so far. It was hysterical. Call me uncouth if you want to, but when Chuck lost Wilson at sea I laughed so hard, I thougt I was going to bust a gut. Everybody was looking as me like...it's supposed to be touching and sentimental and all that. And yes, I got the point that Zemeckis was trying to make, but I couldn't help it, homie was serious stressing over a vollyball. LOL!
