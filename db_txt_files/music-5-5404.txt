Cooper is one of the most underrated performers of alltime. As a matter of fact, he still is great. This is one of his earlier releases with the original band. This badboy is basically a greatest hits album in itself with Hello,Hooray, No More Mister Nice Guy, and Unfinished Suite. You don't own this? Shame. This is hard rock at its finest and it also contains some of Alice's classic shockrock songs as well.
