I like Florida for the beaches and I'm not a big fan of any city there but if I had to choose then Fort Lauderdale would top the ranks for me. It's cleaner than Miami and Tampa and has an awesome inviting beach. Miami is still fun and very close by which is another reason Ft. Lauderdale has appeal. I liked the canals and gorgeous homes and impressive boats that line them. If I had to live in Florida I would choose this place hands down.
