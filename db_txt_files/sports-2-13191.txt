Tennessee is slowly spiraling out of control. From player issues to the head coach being no more than a cowardly informant. It isn't pretty right now at Tennessee. Many don't want to admit the rumblings that Fulmer is on the way out are true. The distractions have seen on field results diminish. 14 losses the past 4 seasons equals the total losses in the previous 7 seasons. 18-8 the past 2 seasons has many Tennessee fans worried. A proud program but one with a huge cloud over it that Tennessee fans are praying does not turn into a thunderstorm.
