Love this gin.. though its true..its not for everyone. a Scottish Gin made in Ayrshire Can't really taste the cucumber infusion, but still a great gin. Goes great with Cranberry, and generally fruity mixes, creates a subtle and very refreshing taste. makes even the cranberry taste better. But i still prefer Magellan's for the good ol' gin & tonic. i find that certain gins are good with some mixes and other brands are delicious another way. i don't think there is one standard one-size-fits-all gin fo' real.
