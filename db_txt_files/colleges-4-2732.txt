The University of Missouri-Rolla is a tough school and is often frustrating, but it offers a great engineering and computer science program. A lot of companies within the engineering community know UM-Rolla well and respect the graduates that the university produces. Lots of students get serious job offers from companies before they complete their undergrad studies. The night life isn't exactly great so you have to make your own fun, but then again, people who go here don't come for the social climate, they come for the degree.
