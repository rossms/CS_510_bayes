While getting an excellent education you can enjoy the lovely surroundings of Boulder which offer more outdoor activities than you can imagine. The campus is large enough to offer multiple opportunites and degree offerings, but not so large that you have to watch your professors on a screen. The largest class size is 450 people and you will only have to take a handfull of classes that size. After your freshman year your average class size is 25 students. Not great for the students trying to squeeze in more skiing opportunities.
