How do I follow a comment like that? Let me just say that at least he is trying to get slots at Maryland horse tracks. You people in Maryland don't know it, but your beloved Preakness will be gone without slots. Unless you want to go to Illinois to see it, it will be gone. He has done a good job and look at Redoedo for everything else. I don't follow Maryland politics that much...
