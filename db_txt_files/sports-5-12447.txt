They have the wise fifth year senior who knows when, and where, and who to out the football into. The Florida Seminoles have a pretty well balanced attack. I predict them to be in the bowl against Michael Vick and the Hokies. The Seminoles are a well coached team thanks to Bobby Bowden. They have Rose Bowl appearances every year and I think that they have a real chance to be in the bowl against the Virginia Tech Hokies. They will compete but not win.
