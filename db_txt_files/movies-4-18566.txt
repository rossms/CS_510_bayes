Some may say that the Poltergeist series is sealed with a curse because of the deaths of many cast member off-set, but what we see here is a pretty good horror movie starring the cute little girl, Heather O Rourke. A tornado almosts hits a family's suburban home, and their daughter is missing. She was sucked into her closet by paranormal sprits that are invading their house, and they had to get whoever was given birth to in the house, or on their grounds. Extremly well done.
