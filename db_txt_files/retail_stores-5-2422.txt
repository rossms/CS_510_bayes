The people that work at my harris teeter know me and treat me like a person, and that is what is missing in every other grocery store, they make an effort to tell me tell me what is on sale, and sometimes what is going to be on sale, and will ask to help me when I'm looking for something, and tell me about what I'm looking for. They are speacial.
