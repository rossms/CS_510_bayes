For the most part I would give Lucille Ball a four rating. She is a great commedienne.I loved her work in I Love Lucy.she is especially good at physical comedy.But not all of her work has been great. i agree with Castlebee that some of her movies were not so good. Especially Mame. I read that she had that role because she bought the rights to the movie. but really she was too old for that role. and singing is not one of her strong points. But when it comes to comedy, she is one of the best.If I had to pick my top ten women for comedy, she would make the list.
