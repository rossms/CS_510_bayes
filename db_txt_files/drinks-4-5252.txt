Yea sure Sprite is good, but Sierra Mist is better, especially when choosing between Diet Sprite Zero and Sierra Mist Free... the Sierra Mist brand tastes less like a diet soda than the Sprite brand- and I'm a dedicated Coke over Pepsi fan (Sierra Mist is a Pepsi-product while Sprite is Coke) so trust me, this stuff is GOOD!
