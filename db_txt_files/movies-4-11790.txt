Wow I thought this would be sooo stupid but other than the trite Matrix parody moments and a few other down-sides, I thought this was very clever. Thumb Wars' Steve Oedekerk stars and directs. Very creative- they took an old samurai film from the 70s and re-dubbed the voices and twisted the story to make for a very funny movie. I'm glad my friend forced me to rent it. Watch carefully- the stuff in the background is the best part. I don't usually care for these movies but these is beyond stupid comedy.
