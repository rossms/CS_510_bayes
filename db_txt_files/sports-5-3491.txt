What a great pitcher he was. His greatest year was obviously the year he took the Mets to the World Series in 1969. His #41 jersey is retired for the Mets, without a doubt. Partnering with the other great Met pitcher Jerry Koosman also got the Mets the ring that year. I believe that he won the Cy Young award three times in his career, and was a remarkable strikeout king!
