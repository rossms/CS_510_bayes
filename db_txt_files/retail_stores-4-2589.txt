O.K, first of all I would disagree with the others. My mother has always took my to Price Choppers when growing up, and I found it to be a very clean, well organized,well stocked grocery store. The employers treated me very well, and they gave me my first job when I had no education. They didn't look at the fact that I had no education. They saw the repect I had for people. Now that I am all grown up, and doing my own grocery shopping, I will continue to shop there. I will admit they aren't the lowest price store out there like they say they are, but they make up with there quality of products.
