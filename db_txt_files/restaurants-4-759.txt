A very tough thing to rate. The fact they sell desserts, a LOT of them, along with regular fast food is wonderful. It is like a Buger King and Baskin Robbins all rolled into one. The prices are very good too. As a child I loved going here to eat because of the great desserts. My kids alos love it. The only reason I wouldn't give it a 5 is that fact the fast food is not very good. It is okay for most things and has a few high points but if it was only a buger place it would not be very good compared to others. A solid eatery if a good snack is part of the plan. If you just want the food go elsewhere.
