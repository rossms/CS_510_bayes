Rudy Giuliani is a great leader and he is a big reason why i want to be in politics. besides some of his obvious pitfalls (everyone has them) like cheating on his wife and all that scandal with Judy Nathan, and the racial profiling, he did good for the city and really showed his true colours as a leader on 9/11.
