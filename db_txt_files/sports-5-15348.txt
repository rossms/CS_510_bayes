Carson Palmer just might be the best quarterback the Bengals ever had. He's not a running quarterback like Ken Anderson (although he DOES have Ken's penchant for pinpoint accuracy) nor does he have Boomer Esiason's smarts, BUT, he's got Joe Montana's cool and poise, he's got a GREAT arm (like former Bengal QB Greg Cook) and he's got a fully loaded arsenal of All-Pro Wide Receivers comparable to what Peyton Manning has in Indianapolis. All those things put the former USC standout at the top of the NFL. He is fun to watch. Thank you Carson for making me a fan again. Go Bengals.
