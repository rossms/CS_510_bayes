Dunn's River Falls is a great place to go and is pretty and it is a lot of fun to climb the falls but unfortunately it's not much of a secret anymore. Like Jamaica itself it's become overrun with tourists and crowded and dirty. I can't help but say you should still go because it is fun but I just wish the word had never gotten out.
