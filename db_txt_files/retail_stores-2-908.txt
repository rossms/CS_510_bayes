Whether you like it or not, Abercrombie & Fitch caters to a young, faux preppy (they are in no way truly preppy) demographic. This particular group pays for the name, not the quality or where the garment was made. Thus, you have an abundance of the brands logo on it's products. Or, you could do what my niece and nephew do and get your uncle to buy you everything there (lol). Bottom line- it's called marketing people, and it's making them quite successful.
