One of the most ruggedly beautiful and colourful places in the world. Elegant people, outdoors lifestyle, fashion, glitz, gorgeous views. People are slim, sexy, speak a lovely language and have a great sense of history related to the present. Their artistry, sense of colour, style and design are unsurpassed anywhere in the world. I would advise anyone to see Lake Garda - it is visually stunning.
