Has to be the best looking coupe of all time. Certainly stirs emotions in onlookers like no other car, more so even than a Ferrari. And when you sit in it, you feel like everybody else is missing out, and you know what, they are! This car will, certainly in terms of styling, never date. It still looks a newer design today than anything else out there. A timeless beauty, with engineering to match, I wallow in humility before it's creators. In terms of import prices, I challenge you to find more car for the money. Don't try, it's a fruitless task.
