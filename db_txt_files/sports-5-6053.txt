With Sumpter down, Foye is the best player on the #4 ranked team in the country. At 6'2", he's strong as a horse and an unbelievable leaper. As a sophomore, he tried (unsuccessfully) to throw it down twice over Emeka Okafor to end a Nova / UCONN game. He's that athletic, and that fearless. He can also shoot from deep, and is the Cats defensive stopper. I was surprised to see Ray and Sumpter on All America ballots and not Foye... my guess is as the season progresses, that will prove to be an oversight.
