Stellar, but Enigmatic. The most productive shortstop in baseball history in terms of batting. 57 homers in a season by a freakin' shortstop -- give me a break. A legitimate shot at 700 homers. Now the enigmatic part, A-ROD leaves Seattle and the Mariners win 116 games. A-ROD leaves Texas and the Rangers go from doormat to contender. A-ROD goes to the Yankees and they commit the BIGGEST CHOKE IN SPORTS HISTORY. It defies logic that a team would improve with the departure of his potent bat, but the acquiring ballclub regresses.
