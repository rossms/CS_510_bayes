This is a great town to visit and has many job options. Many people think it is only about Disney, but there are millions of others things to see and do : Point Orlando, Sea World, Church Street Station, Universal and Wet Wild just to name a few. The traffic may be bad but there is never a dull moment. There are many types of people and it never gets to cold. There are so many places to shop it would take you a whole month to go to them all and you would never run out of resturants.
