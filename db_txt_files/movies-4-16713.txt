When I heard Will Smith was going to play Mohammed Ali, one of the greatest boxers of all time I laughed until my sides hurt. I mean the concept of Will The Fresh Prince of Bel Air Smith playing such a demanding and very serious role when his personality couldn't be more distant, amused me highly. When I watched the film his performance alone silenced me. As I mentioned in a previous post I'm not a fan of the director Michael Mann, but this film was well told, well written and imprssed me with an outstanding cast who played their characters brilliantly.
