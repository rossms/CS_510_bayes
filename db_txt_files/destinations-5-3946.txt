One of my absolute favorite cities. Beautiful people, beautiful beaches, international flair, truely tropical. Nightlife at its best. Great restaurants, excellent shopping, so much to see and do. South Beach in Miami Beach is a must see. Tourist from all over the world come here. Could I live here? Absolutely
