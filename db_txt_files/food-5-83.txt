Yes, it's the best (but only the old-fashioned kind, not the instant or the flavored varieties). Having said that, I do admit that I add sugar or brown sugar, and maybe a little maple flavoring to spice it up, but overall, it's the best thing for you for breakfast. It does stick to your ribs (especially if you happen to spill some on the front of your shirt!).
