What a great great beer. I've tried them all, but nothing hits me like a chilled bottle of Sammy's. I can't say I didn't like one make of what Samuel Adams has to offer, great finish without a horrible aftertaste. . . at my supermarket-- $8.99/12pk of Bud, vs. 9.99/12pk of Sam Adams,- go ahead and make the right decision.
