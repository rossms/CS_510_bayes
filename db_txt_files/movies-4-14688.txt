It was a pretty good, captivating, compelling drama. As Wiggum said, a David and Goliath type of movie. I thought that Julia Roberts gave one of her best performances yet as Erin Brockovich. She was both serious and cocky at the same time, and it was a nice change to see her take on such a role. This movie is definately worth watching at least once if you like legal dramas or Julia Roberts.
