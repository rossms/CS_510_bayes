I am a huge sixers fan and I dont see how ANYBODY could talk bad about Allen Iverson, he takes it to the hole and gets beat up constantly, he fights through injuries, and he is one of the greatest players of all time. He deserves more recognition then he gets and he should be ranked in the top 30 of the best NBA players ever
