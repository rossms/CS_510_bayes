This latest album from the Chili Peppers is definitely their best with the return of their old guitarist who sat out the Aeroplane album. The Chili Peppers pump out great rock n' roll jams. Songs like 'Scar Tissue' and the title track 'Californication' top the albums best. Those who listen all the way through will also be rewarded with songs like 'Otherside'.
