This is an underrated early King novel that tends to get overlooked. The story involves a terrible accident which plunges a man into a coma. Coming out of the coma years later, he's able to view a person's future when he comes into contact with them. King split this story into three parts and all three sections work very well for me. I think the suspense was built up in leiu of horror or terror, but that's not a bad thing to watch King trying something different. He succeeds and The Dead Zone is better than many a King novel.
