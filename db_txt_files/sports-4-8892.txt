I am a die hard KINGS FOUANNNN! And I love this over seas player. Already has a Gold medal in the olympics, 2 all stars, 2 time 3-pt shoot out champion, and several other little honors. I think he has a legitament shot at the NBA's MVP this year. But I can't quite rank him at 5, for 2 reasons. #1 Rick Fox knows how to defend him. And #2, he still aint as good as my man Bobby Jackson! GO KINGS, beat the L.A. Ladies and their greatest 3 players in Shaq, Kobe, and David Stern.
