There was a clerk at the Walmart near me that was VERY rude to me--I took a floppy disc in and had pictures printed off it--this particular clerk wa extremely rude to me as some of the photos had someones name on them--well, she confiscated all but 3--really pissed me off!! I won't be doing any picture business with that particular store!! I'm still pissed off about it--a local drug store printed those photos for me--no problem!!!!!
