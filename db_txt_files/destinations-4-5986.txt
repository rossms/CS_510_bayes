A state of 4 regions- The Appalachian western panhandle the DC-Baltimore metro-mega plex the rural north near the PA border, the eastern Shore. My favorite is the rural north centered around Frederick- peaceful and quiet. DC and to a lesser degree Baltimore is too congested and pricey. While I love Washington, I would not live in that area now.
