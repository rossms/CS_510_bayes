Canada has some hope for it. Canada and the US could be really strong friends, too bad so many people from both sides hate each other. What Canada needs most is a new government. Next is a culture. It seems like they do everything the US does; mainly television. Newfoundland and northern parts of Canada is spectacular. Where's thier army?
