I find it ironic that several people criticize others for injecting religion where it doesn't belong yet here rate an actor on his politics. Heston is alright as an actor. I like him more than most will simply because he was in many classic sci-fi/fantasy type movies. His range is a bit limited but he can do drama fairly well.
