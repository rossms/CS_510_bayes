Great Player! And is now playing 3rd base like the Gold Glove winner that he is. He's just a great all around talent and is the 2nd best player in baseball after Barry Bonds. Makes a lot of $$$$, which I think no athlete in the world should make that much. He is also a nice guy and plays hard everyday.
