True, I rated several of the candies listed on this site. However, my sweet of choice above all others (and the one I find most difficult to avoid) is ice cream. There are some as good (like Ben and Jerry), but none better IMO than Haagen-Dazs. Rich, creamy, silky-smooth and sworn enemy of arteries the world over. I am a little confused about one thing though - whatever happened to Triple Chocolate Overload?
