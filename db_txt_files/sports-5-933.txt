Just the leader the SOX have been looking for. The A-Rod confrontation got the ball rolling. He basically told the Yankees and his teammates that We are not going to be pushed around or play second fiddle to anyone. He backed his words up. Boston must sign him, irregardless what they claim their restrictions are!
