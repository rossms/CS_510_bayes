I was among the chorus of folks who couldn't believe it when Torre was originally selected as Yankee manager. I thought it was another awful decision by Big George who decided to choose a retread with a losing record. Boy, has Torre proved everyone wrong. It turns out that Joe is the perfect manager for this team. No one could have done a better job of managing all of the talent and egos on this team. He does all of the little things that aren't noticed to keep his players interested and motivated.
