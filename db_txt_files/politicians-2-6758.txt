I'm giving him a Bad rating instead of terrible because of the previous message. He absolutely shouldn't be hanged and that should be taken off this site fast. That big, Don King-like, tuft of hair should be hanged though. What's THAT all about? Granted, even with a cool dew, Al would still look like he fell out of the ugly tree and hit every single branch on the way down. The thing that amazes me most about this guy is that he can speak for an hour and I still won't be able to decipher what the hell he's talking about. Way to go AL! Remember, Stay out the Bushes!
