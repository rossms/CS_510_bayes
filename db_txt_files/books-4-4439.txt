This was a groundbreaking book when it first appeared, but seems a tad pale and the writing strikes one as somewhat turgid now that the book has been put to the test of time. Wright's Native Son, which deals with a similar topic, is a far superior novel. Ellison shot his entire literary bolt with this book, which also tends to diminish the degree of accomplishment in IM. BTW, callmetootie should be called callmeignorant : the Wells book of similar title is a second-rate fantasy, and like the rest of Wells' works, poorly written.
