It must have been someone's birthday because it was as if the casting department started the day out sober (this would be when they selected Gary Oldman and Anthony Hopkins) and by the time they got around to Keanu Reeves and Winona Ryder they were so drunk they just said sure, why not - more beer! Otherwise this was a generally crappy and weird adaption of the classic tale that had only one redeeming virtue that appealed to me personally - really great looking costumes. But, it just wasn't quite enough.
