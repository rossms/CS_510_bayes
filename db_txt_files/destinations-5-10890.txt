This is the best amusement park ever! This is the park with the most roller coasters. My favorite ride is the Iron Dragon. This park also has a varity of other great rides for people young and old. It is amazing how they make great rides. I have always loved this park. I hope i can go again this summer. I want to see what new attractions they have added. Power Tower was okay. This park is even in the Book of world records for being the park with the most roller coasters. I have a lot of other favorite rides I have been on. I even like the Swinging Ship. this is one of the theme parks that I reccomend.
