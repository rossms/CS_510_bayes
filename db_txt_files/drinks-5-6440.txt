This is fantastic tasting. It taste slightly metallic, with rich, vibrant syrup overtones and a bubbling caramel flabour, with a hint of cinnamon. Much like classic coke, althoughy tinny and bubbly - Good in my book. Get some while it lasts - I think my fellow TaB Cultists would agree we are a dying breed.
