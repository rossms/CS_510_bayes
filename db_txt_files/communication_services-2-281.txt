I had BellSouth Mobility for a year, and to be honest, I don't understand why anyone would stay with this plan when there are nationwide plans like Sprint and AT T available. If you travel at all, your BellSouth charges will quickly go through the roof. I drove across the country recently, using my BellSouth phone sparingly to check messages and get work updates. My bill was nearly $500. Need I say more?
