Jim Thorpe, American Indian, Olympic athlete was to me one of the best athletes ever. His versatility simplicity and love of sport for sports sake transcends anything I have ever encountered. It was a crime when they (The Olympic Committee) took away his gold medals and gave it back to him years after he died. He should have had them while alive.
