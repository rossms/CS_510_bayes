Campbell was the great popularizer of world mythologies and Jungian archetypes, and a magnificent writer, teacher and speaker as well. This book was the source for Star Wars--Lucas said so himself, and Campbell was pleased with the first movie, which was based on the myth of the heroic journey which is given in full in this wonderful book. He's a little easier to read than Jung, and in fact it's hard to put this thing down.
