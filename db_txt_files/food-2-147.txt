The taste is so bland. Not peanut buttery, not chocolatey...just like cardboard. The balls get soggy pretty fast and even worse they're not crunchy to begin with! They're kinda soft even try which doesn't help the flavour probably. A mix of Cocoa Puffs and Peanut Butter Cap'n Crunch is a million times better
