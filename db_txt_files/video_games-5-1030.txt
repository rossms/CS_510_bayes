If you like conquest strategy games (a la Axis and Allies, etc.) you'll like Samurai Swords. Lots of fun. Build up your fuedal japanese forces and wipe out your enemies' armies. Rules are farely straightforward and intuitive (especially for the genre). If you're looking for a new conquest strategy board game and haven't tried it yet, give Samurai Swords a go (used to be called 'Shogun').
