I thought that the album was pretty good. The problem I had with Issues was that it was all build up and no pay-off. At least on this album you can hear some melodies. It's refreshing to hear Davis NOT grunting and growling for a change. On the other hand, there are only about four or five HEAVY Korn-like songs which is somewhat dissapointing. Overall though, I approve!!!
