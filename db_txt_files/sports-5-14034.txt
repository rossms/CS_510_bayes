Montana is simply the essence of what a Legend is. When I look at a NFL QB, Stats aren't as important as how he commands the offense. Bottom line, The QB controls the whole offense and is the glue that holds it together (not the RB, not the O-Line, not the O-coordinator....NO!). If the QB can't command the team in all aspects (poise, mental awareness, physical strentgh, decision making and raw talent), then He is not and should not be considered the greatest QB. You have to have them all and Joe Montana has/had it all.
