A great man, but not so good president. He was very kind to Robert E. Lee, he did not ask him to surrender his sword. In the peace agreement he let the southern men take their horses home with them because they would be needed to plow the fields. In later years when someone was putting down Grant, Robert Lee overheard the man talking and dressed him down (he was very upset, and told the man so).
