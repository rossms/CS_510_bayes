Always take ratings for cell phone services with a grain of salt. Customer's experiences vary greatly, and people I talk to always have something negative to say about their previous service, regardless of the company. That said, this rating is based on my previous experience with Verizon's pre-paid service, so I cannot comment on their billing. Reception is excellent, even inside my house where my current service (Virgin Mobile; see my review) has a problem working. I am using Virgin Mobile currently since they are cheaper and overall the service is great.
