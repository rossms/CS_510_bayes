Sort of like Burlington, VT on Lake Ontario. Lots of college kids, good eateries, and a very vibrant nightlife downtown. Sailing community and retirees are also huge. Lots of musicians came out of this town...so that counts for something. Only drawback is that outside of downtown and the lakefront...the city is generally suburban sprawl and very ugly. And...very very cold in the winter.
