Magellan, what are you talking about. Have you ever even been there? Virginia Tech's Engineering and Architecture programs are top-ranked, it is home to one of the nation's few veterinary schools, and it's programs in Education and Agriculture and Life Sciences are revolutionary. All this and set in the beautiful Appalachian Mountains where you can hike, bike, camp and raft down the 2nd oldest river in the world. There is something for everyone at Virginia Tech. www.vt.edu
