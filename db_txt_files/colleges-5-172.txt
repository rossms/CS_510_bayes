Speaking as a product of their MBA and MS in CIS joint degree program I would say fantastic school, with amazing facilities and great professors. It is expensive, but the network of alums, particular in SFL will carry you a long way after graduation when you are actually out there trying to find a job...name recognition...It carries weight in SFL over other cheaper local schools like FIU for instance...I have never had a problem finding employment and making a decent living...no regrets
