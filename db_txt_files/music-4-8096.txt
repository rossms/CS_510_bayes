Possibly one of the most disturbing videos ever made. The images have nothing to do with the lyrics. I remember seeing this video on FRIDAY NIGHT VIDEOS in the '80s (our family didn't have MTV). There were scenes of people in agony, from what I remember. I can't remember specific details, other than it was troubling stuff.
