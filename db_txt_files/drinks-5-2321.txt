It really gets a 4.75 because San Pellegrino/Gerolsteiner get my true 5 stars, but I love sparkling mineral water nonetheless. Very refreshing, and I definitely agree about this product - and most sparkling waters - being an acquired taste, but give it time and enjoy the difference between this and Evian and the like.
