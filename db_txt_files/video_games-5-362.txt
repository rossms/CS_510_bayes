Greatest Game Of All Time, 2nd only to.. Riven (MYST 2.) I love this game, it may be over some people's heads but this game does in fact have a storyline, and a well built inthralling storline at that. If you don't understand why it's such a great game, read the journals. Play the game. Beat it. The end isn't the best but.. *gasp* There is a sequel that starts right after the end of the last game. Wow, the end is a completly different game. But wait.. thats not the end either.. Perhaps the ending has not yet been written.
