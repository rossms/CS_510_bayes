The Buccs are the team to watch if you get turned on by hard hitting, ball batting, QB sacking gridiron action!! One word:DEFENSE!! Sapps' speed and agility (not to mention vertical leap- how many forced fumbles is that!?) make him the most exciting DT to watch. Lynch - Gotta love a crazy white boy at free safty! and your always in good hands with ALSTOT!! players to watch M. Jones, J. green and gotta give some luv to DUNN. GO BUCCS!!!!!
