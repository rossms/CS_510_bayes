I have always liked Audery Hepburn. I would really give her about a 4.5. She is a wonderful actress, and she has a lot of charm. She was perfect in Roman Holiday, as the runaway princess, who is befriended by Gregory Peck. She made a wonderful Eliza Doolittle in My Fair Lady. I also liked her work in the Nun's Story. Breakfast at Tiffanys was good too. She also seemed like such a great person with the charity work she did for UNICEF.
