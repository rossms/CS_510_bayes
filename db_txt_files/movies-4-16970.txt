A wonderfully acted as well as wonderful looking movie. Cameron Crowe directed this brilliant movie which examined how one man's physical disfigurement leads to the disfiguring of his charming personality as well. A dazzling story that seems fairly predictable but bobs, weaves, twists, and turns in ways that the viewer could never see coming. Finally, the movie is brought to a happy yet bittersweet conclusion. The only negative I felt about this movie was that it was a bit slow at parts. Overall though, it's a good one.
