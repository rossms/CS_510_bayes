'Oh, they say he's a decent man but...maybe it's just his advisors...' - H.I. McDonough. Bush,jr wishes that he could tap into that 'folksy' thing that RR could. Clinton often referred to RR. Bush#1 loved 'Voodoo Economics'. Somehow, RR pulled it off. 2nd Best President of my lifetime (Nixon woulda been, but he di that 'thing'). I wish 'jr' xould've learned from him.
