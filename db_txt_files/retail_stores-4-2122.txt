Regarding comment by 'rs007001', the observation about Radio Shack lacking in racial/ethnic diversity is not true where I live--both stores here have excellent representation of races, ages, and sex. I am a frequent customer buying several cell phones, home protection devices, and other electronics because they are so service-oriented and pleasant.
