Of all the comets and/or meteors headed for Earth movies that came out a few years ago, this was one of the best two. (There were only two anyway, haha). Oh well, this will keep you fairly entertained for a couple of hours, and there are some pretty impressive effects. I love watching the city of Paris, France getting blown up over and over thanks to my dvd player's jump/pause.
