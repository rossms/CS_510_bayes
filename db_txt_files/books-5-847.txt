This book is excellently written. It gives children a whole new world to experience. Rowling captured the character of Harry in the book very well, he was a nice 3D character with a lot of in-depth feelings. The other characters were also well defined. I liked this book and think it's good for kids because it lets them see that even if you're new to something, you should give it a try. Harry was new to Hogwarts, being a wizard and playing quiddith, but he overcame all that and turned out to be quite good, while still having lots of fun. It's a good message.
