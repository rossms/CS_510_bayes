My granparents lived in Valencia all during my childhood and my the majority of my cousins worked at Magic Mountain. We had season tickets and went just about every summer, anywhere from 6 to 12 times. It was so fun! I remember when they built the Colosus. It was the fastest rollercoaster of that time. And, did you know that the Vacation (Chevy Chase) was filmed there? The rollercoaster that they get arrested on is the Revolution.
