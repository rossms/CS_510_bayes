hmm1234 - could I kindly suggest that the next time you are in Edinburgh you try a little imagination? It's not a big city and there is loads of stuff to do there. I'm English and a Londoner but at the risk of breaking a British tradition, I will compliment this great Scots city. The only theing missing from Edinburgh is a river running through it. Otherwise, it has everything.
