Pretty good movie. about Frank Abagnale,who was a teenage con artist. I read the book too so I was interested in seeing the movie. As usual the book and movie have their differences. Leonardo Dicaprio did a fine job as frank who wrote over 4 million dollars worth of bad checks and posed, as an airline pilot, doctor, even passed the bar test for a lawyer. amazing young man. Awfully long though.tom Hanks was good too.
