An extremely mediocre film for teenyboppers. Whatever few good points this movie had were quickly replaced by obnoxious characters and a weak storyline. None of the characters are likeable but Lindsay Lohan was just grating to watch on screen for that long. Also its amazing how the wonder of studio work and digital alteration change Lohan's horrible voice. Simply put- don't subject yourself to this crap.
