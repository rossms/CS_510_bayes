I'M NOT SURE YOU RECEIVED THIS-I JUST WANT TO SAY THAT MY DAUGHTER AND I SHOP AT PUBLIX EVERY WEEK.IN 1 WEEK THE PRICE OF SMUCKERS LIGHT SUGAR FREE JAM WENT FROM 2.29 TO 2.69 PER JAR. I NOW PURCHASE IT AT WALMART FOR 2.00 PER JAR AND THE PRICE DOESN'T CHANGE EVERY WEEK.WE ARE GETTING VERY TIRED OF YOUR PRICES RISING SO MUCH. YOU PUT SOMETHING ON SALE 1 WEEK AND THE NEXT WEEK THE PRICE GOES UP. WE HEAR PEOPLE COMPLAIN ALL THE TIME WHEN WE ARE SHOPPING. DO SOMETHING PLEASE!!!
