classic case of a great back on a horrible team. i cant say i support his retirement descision but you know, i would get sick of losing all the time also. i think he should have just left and went to another team, that would have taken some of the heat off. but i realy hate it when a great back gets stuck on a horrible team. rashaan salaam had potential to be one of the greats, and he got stuck with the bears. hey i would be a pot head too if i had to play with their 95' offensive line. poor bastard
