This is a really impressive sequel to Soul Edge, which came out on PlayStation in 1998. The polygons are just so smooth on the Dreamcast that the characters simply stood out as real. I simply loved the demonstration of strokes and moves by each character. I believe that the strokes were very well choreographed. It's a musst for any martial arts enthusiast who's also hooked on computer games.
