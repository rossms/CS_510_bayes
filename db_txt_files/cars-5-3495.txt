A really great car based SUV. In Japan they call the Kluger V and it translates in German to The Intelligent One . Pretty much all the short comings of a typical SUV have been carefully worked out on this vehicle. The ride and comfort is excellent and the craftmanship is excellent. I purchased the 4x4 4cyl. model for better gas mileage (24 mph avg.).
