I had a 1998 F-150 4x2 Lariat Limited Edition. The truck looked great, but lacked power and got lousy mileage. It was loud, and had a power steering noise that Ford said was normal. This was after changing the power steering pump and steering box. Rear end developed a shuttering during turns and the paint always looked like it had water spots. Although it was more comfortable than my Buick, I traded this truck in for a 2000 Silverado.
