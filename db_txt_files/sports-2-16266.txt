Wow... If there's one thing he's done right this season, it's been sucking. He did awful when he was in there and has spent the rest of the season injured. I mean, whenver Brad Johnson is outperforming you in your place, maybe that's indictive of the fact that you are not an elite quarterback... probably not even a decent one.... Besides, isn't he tied for the record of most fumbles ever in an NFL season with 23? That isn't the kind of record I'd want to hold.
