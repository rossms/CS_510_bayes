Enjoyed movie, however the ending was a bit abrupt. The text at the end told what happened to the various people, but somehow I felt cheated at the end like the director ran out of time and had to cut the rest of the story short. Would have been better if they showed how the ambassador and security advisor were caught in their lies...
