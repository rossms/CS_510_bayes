Scrabble just isn't a board game that I got into playing alot, mainly because all of the tiles go all over the place and taht really annoys me. The other reason is that the game gets so confusing and you make up these stuid words, and get so embarrassed when someone tells you that it's not a word, and it's just really weird.
