I have to admit I never saw her in any movie that impressed me very much, but by the time she came to television she proved herself to be a comic genius. She was willing to let herself look foolish, and as a result became one of the most respected performers of all time. Next to Mabel Normand she is my all time favorite comedienne. I Love Lucy!
