In general, a great phone. Has easy one-touch features like an address book, caller ID, etc. Bad points: you have to type a password to get voice mail--who can stare at the keypad, type in a code, and not run into the car in front of them at the same time? Also, battery develops a memory fairly quickly...I bought mine in July '99 and used to be able to go 3 days without recharge. Now, by Nov., I can only go a day and a half. And the batteries are expensive!
