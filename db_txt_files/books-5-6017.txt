Ridley Pearson is one of the best authors around if you like skillfully crafted plots and solid character development. Most of his stories have a strong forensics focus as well, and I have consistently enjoyed his work over the years. A good place to start is the first novel which introduces Seattle police detective Lou Boldt, Undercurrents. I am surprised that you mystery readers have not rated more of Ridley Pearson's other novels. Give him a try, and read the Boldt novels in order so you better understand the plot.
