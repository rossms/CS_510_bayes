Their only saving grace is the breakfast sandwiches. The roast beefs are dry, the burgers are gross, the fries are cold (and they will insist they're hot even when they're not) the Frisco, while good, is greasy messy. I got sick off the monster burger. I avoid it if possible...but they get a 2 star rating for their breakfast.
