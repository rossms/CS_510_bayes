I live in Brisbane, the BEST CITY IN THE WORLD. Come top think of it, that's probably because I live here. Did I mention that there are lots of birds here? Oh, there ARE lots of birds... Um, you can get very good potato wedges from leonards chicken shop at toombul shopping centre. It's about 15 mins from town by train, they're great for international tourists. The wedges, I mean. So, to summerise, I live here, lots of birds, wedges close to town, WHAT A HAPPNIN' PLACE!!!
