I don't think I realized that this guy can really play until that stretch when Webber was out with an injury. The Kings, contrary to my expectations, kept winning, and it certainly wasn't Funderburke carrying the team. Peja really raised his game to pick up the slack. Then just the other night I saw highlights from the Kings big OT win over the Spurs, where Peja hit the game-winning jumper (after Webber had fouled out). It was a clutch play that showed Stojakovic has some mental toughness to complement his shooting ability.
