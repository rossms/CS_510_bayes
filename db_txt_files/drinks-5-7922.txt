Old Grand Dad is an excellent non small batch bourbon. Many of the uninformed look at the orange label and think it is rought gut whiskey. Oh contre', this is a very smooth bourbon. I have drank almost every quality bourbon out there; Buffalo Trace, Makers Mark, Rip Van Winkle, Knob Creek, Wild Turkey, Woodford Reserve but I always return to Old Grand Dad. Yea you yuppies stick with your designer Vodkas in the fancy over priced bottles and I'll stick with the smoothest bourbon around - Old Grand Dad.
