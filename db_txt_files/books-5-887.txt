This was the first book I ever read more than twice. I simply adore it. It's a powerful book, and those who call it boring most likely don't quite grasp all the concepts within it. The ending in particular is a good one, leaving it up to the reader to interpret what exactly it means (me, I'm an optimist). Definitely a good read for those who can understand it, probably 12 and above.
