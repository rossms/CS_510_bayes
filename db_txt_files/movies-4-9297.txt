 9 to 5 is a riot! The movie is about three secretaries who end up kidnapping their ogre of a boss and holding him hostage while they reorganize his department. Dolly Parton, Lily Tomlin, and Jane Fonda play off each other really well, and Dabney Coleman (their boss) is a guy you love to hate. The movie is fast-paced, highly entertaning, and a lot of fun- definitely worth a rental.
