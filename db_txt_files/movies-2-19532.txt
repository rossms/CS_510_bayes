Surprisingly, this was not the worst movie that I've ever seen. Dude, where's my car is definitely worse, and I remain a big fan of Shannon Elizabeth. The ghosts are kind of creepy and weird, and the idea of a satan constructed house machine that is powered by the energy of captured spirits is actually kind of creative. That being said, the movie is ridiculous, and the acting pretty bad. Watch it on cable if you have absolutely nothing else to do - you will probably find that 13 ghosts is not a horrible movie.
