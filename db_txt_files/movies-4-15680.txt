I thought that men of honor was a good movie. I think that Cuba Gooding jr and Robert Deniro made a good team in this movie. The movie is about a guy named Carl who wants to become a master diver and when he gets his chance people try to mess it up for him but when he becomes a master diver he has an accident with his leg and has to learn to walk again with a artifical and has to prove that he can still dive. With the help from Robert Deniros character he gets it back.
