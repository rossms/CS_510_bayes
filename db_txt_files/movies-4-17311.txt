This movie has a fresh and innovative approach to telling the story of the holocaust and the people it affected. The humor is excellent and also plays as a social metaphor in many instances. After pondering on the movie a few days, I could not help but feel that although I initially also participated in the illusion created by the father, that the whole movie itself, is also an illusion and just as unreal and impossible as the illusion portrayed in it.
