Good movie. I liked the plot about a african american teenage boy, and an eldery writer, and the friendship that developed between them.It was a bit predictable.but enjoyable.Sean Connery was good as the older bitter writer who has become a recluse. the young actor who played Jamal was good as well. I liked how the characters helped each other.Forrester to help Jamal realize his talents as a writer, and for Jamal to get Forrester out of his reclusive world and to join the outside world.
