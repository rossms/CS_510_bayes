A disturbing and provocative work by Stanley Kubrick based on the book by someone else. A classic. Kubrick also directed Lolita in the 1950s and The Shining based on Stephen King's book among other classics! If the very sight of gratuitous violence and sex is something you can't stand, don't watch this. But it's a powerful statement about brainwashing and the individual spirit, though troubling.
