Located along the northeast coast of Australia and one of the official Seven Wonders of the Natural World, the Great Barrier Reef is the world's longest-spanning natural wonder (not including the Auroras) and is ironically the most fragile as it is made up of the skeletons of generations of marine polyps that lived and died just under the surface of the crystal clear sea. The Great Barrier Reef is 2,000-kilometers (1,242-miles) long, and the first European to discover it was Captain James Cook in 1770.
