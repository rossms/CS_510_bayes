I reall enjoyed this film. Great scenery and costumes. The overall story is kinda, enh, but it has some very funny moments and as I said very interesting and elaborate costumes. However, if you get offended or put out by cross dressers (even on film in a comedy) then don't bother. One piece of advice I can pass on though is DON'T see To Wong Fu with Love which is the American version of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert and oh momma does it stink! I'm talking unbelieveably horrid.
