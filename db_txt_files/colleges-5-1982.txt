Clemson University was one of the best overall experiences I have ever had in my life. Academically, i was challenged for six years in the tough discipline of architecture. Socially, I was enriched my many friends, many events, and much happiness. Emotionally, I was affected in such a way that I still love going back to see that wonderful campus, those great people and remembering all those great memories that will always stay with me.
