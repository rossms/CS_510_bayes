Hmm, Catwoman was my favorite character on Batman reruns, and I was kind of looking forward to this movie. Now considering its negative reviews, I'll probably wait til it comes out on DVD, if I even bother to see it. I do like Halle Berry's costume;I wish I could look that great in a Catwoman costume!
