The sad thing is that as much of a scoundrel as Nixon was, and he was a scoundrel, he would be immensely preferable to the person we have in the White House right now. At least, no one ever questioned Nixon's intellectual capacity. And certain things he did during his presidency were progressive. Still, Nixon's basic character was repellent and you don't have to look just at Watergate to see that. Examine his entire political career. He was a miserable, repugnant person.
