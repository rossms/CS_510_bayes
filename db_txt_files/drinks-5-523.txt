The Old Speckled Hen, affectionately called the Chicken in our office, is a most superb beer with outstanding character. It has a distinct flavour and aroma that is a fitting end to most any day. Although somewhat difficult to find (my supplier has trouble keeping it on the shelves), it is worth seeking. So, next time you're out, bring back a box of chicken .
