The greatest basketball player I ever saw play the game. I'm 32 years Old and can remember the day the story broke on the local news here in Maryland. He was the first B-Ball player that was literally Un-stoppable. He had size, power, grace and pure Skills and every one was looking foward to the years of Bias vs Jordan. Bias (Not Jordan) made people watch B-Ball who never watched it before and he wasn't even a Pro yet. If you never saw him play go out and find a tape and you'll appreciate what real basketball is all about.
