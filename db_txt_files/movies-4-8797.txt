This is worth seeing just for the second half alone. Once the dog show actually started, I was laughing so hard at the commentators that I was having trouble seeing through the tears. You know, when you laugh so hard and so long you're stomach actually hurts. It's not as active as Spinal Tap, but, if you'll recall, Tap had it's share of lulls. Best In Show shouldn't be less than wonderful to anyone who thoroughly enjoyed Waiting For Guffman.
