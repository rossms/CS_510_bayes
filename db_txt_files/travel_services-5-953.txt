For the potential nightmare that using a moving service can be, Bekins actually did an acceptable job when I moved across country. They met the window of time for delivery of my things. Nothing was brokem. I liked the crew that moved and delivered my stuff. I compared Bekins with the other major moving companies and for my trip, they were the most cost-effective. One of my bikes was stolen from under their noses, but that is not their fault and I was immediately reimbursed for it. Overall I had a really positive experience with Bekiins especially with sucj low expectations.
