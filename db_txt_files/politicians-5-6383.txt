I was an admirer of Sen. Quayle years before he became Vice-President. Those who have worked with him and know him are impressed by his intelligence. They're also surprised, because it's only after they're with him that they realize the Press invented his lightweight reputation from the start, simply because they hate Conservatives. This country could be turned around morally if the people would stop believing our dishonest and arrogant media.
