CEC is a waste of time and money. you can throw your kds a far better pizza party, and save money while doing so. The food quality is not all that great. I agree that a big rat as a kid's eatery mascot is kind of creepy and can possibly send subliminals to kids that it's ok to see rodents in restaurants around their food. Disneyland's mascot was a cartoon first, and Mickey Mouse doesn't look nearly as creepy as CEC does. Bottom line is, you can still make your kids very very happy, and save significant money by avoiding CEC.
