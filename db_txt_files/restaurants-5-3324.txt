I am so disappointed that there are no Papa Jogn's stores in San Francisco. First off, there is not a ton of great pizza out here that I know of, so it would be nice to have a good old stand-by like Papa's. By far and away my favorite of the pizza chains. Good toppings, I love the sauce, they always have a good promotion going and the crust is not too thick or not too thin. The garlic dipping sauce (liquid heart attack) and hot peppers are just the nicest little added bonuses. Please Papa, get a place in the high rent district and open up some pizza shops in San Francisco.
