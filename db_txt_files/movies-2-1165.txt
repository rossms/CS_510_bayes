First Rambo movie with Sly Stallone. Piece of junk. The worst scene is Rambo jumping off a mountain, landing on jagged rocks with a small scratch. Final monologue by Sly is delivered in the rare language of moronic imbecilic since English speakers are not able to comprehend it. If anyone knows what he was saying in the final speach, please post it for me.
