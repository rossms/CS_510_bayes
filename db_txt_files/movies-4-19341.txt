Child's Play is one movie I wouldn't have guessed in a million yeras would be scary. The movie was so visually well done, that I think it won some really big award. Charles Lee Ray is a serial killer who after being shot, uses voodoo to transferr his soul into a toy doll. He is taken in by the homeless, and sold to a young boy named Andy. Andy is the only one who knows that Chucky is a serial killer, but they become best buddies and do mysterious crimes together, killing off members of Andy's family.
