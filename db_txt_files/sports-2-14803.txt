I hate Emmitt Smith. The only reason why he is any good is because of his offensive line. Emmitt has no speed or power. He often gets caught from behind on break away plays due to his lack of speed. He is very fortunate to play behind a dominant offensive line, and without it he would be a nobody, like he is now.
