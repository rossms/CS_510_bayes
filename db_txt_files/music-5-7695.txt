Ahhhhh.....Madonna......my favorite. She is so talented with visual performance it's frightening. Not only do her videos rock (and this one is by far one of the bests next to Ray of Light and the classic MATERIAL GIRL) but her music always morphes into something different from album to album. Who else would've had the balls to do a video in the 80s that would be deemed blasphemous?
