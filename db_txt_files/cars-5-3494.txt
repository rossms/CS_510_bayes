Toyota quality, ride of a car with the convenience of a SUV. V6 has great pep while maintaing good gas mileage for this class vehicle. 18/20 in town, 23/25 highway for a V6 2wd LOADED model. While slightly higher priced than its competitors, if you are looking for a mid sized SUV tht will remain reliable for years to come and built to the high quality standards that the Japanese are know for, this is the SUV for you. BTW, this model is built in Japan (not the US) at the same facility as the Lexus RX 300!
