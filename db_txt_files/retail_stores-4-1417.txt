I work at Target and it's an OK job, but speaking from a guests perspective, it's a pretty good store. The only thing I don't like is that the cashiers ALWAYS ask you to apply for a Target card. Being an employee, I know that it's the cashier's job, its still very annoying. I also find the non-donation to veterans rather disturbing. Very disturbing actually.
