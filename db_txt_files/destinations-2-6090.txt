Gambling. Mafioso. Brown, brown, brown. Blowing sagebrush. Yucca Flat Nuclear Waste Disposal. This is the Nevada I know. Outside of Reno, Las Vegas, and Carson City (three of the fastest-growing cities in the country), Nevada's economy is not very diverse, having historically followed a boom-or-bust mentality. Driving through is my idea of a visit to Nevada. UNLV was put on probation for a few years because of recruiting violations. What a way for a state to sell its esteemed academic institutions.
