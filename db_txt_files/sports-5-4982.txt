Pistol Pete scored 44.2 points per game and no one has come close to that mark despite the fact the NCAA have made it EASIER to score. - 3 point line - shot clock - liberalization of "palming/ carrying" rules Remember Pete once hit 30 out of 31 free throws in a game in Oregon. No one has ever scored that much from the line in a regulation game.
