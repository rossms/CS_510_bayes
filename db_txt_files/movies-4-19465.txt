I have to jump on board and express my admiration for this installment in the Friday the 13th series. Sure, it's just as silly as the rest, but the black humor was well done and was more entertaining than most of these type of films. An alternate title (for those in-the-know) would be Friday the 13th Part VI: Die Horshack Die.
