How can you say he wont be a great pro player. Ocahc K said he can should a perfect form JUmper from 40 ft. That is better that ray allen and Peja so if he cant be as good as either of them then Coahc K shuoldnt win 3 titles. O wait he already has. And he has a great recruiting class. Something tells me he knows something about basketball. So when Coach k praises you, you know your for real. REDICK IS A REAL PRO ALL-NBA PLAYER. QOUTE ME ON THAT
