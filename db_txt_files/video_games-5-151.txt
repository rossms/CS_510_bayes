ahh, the sequel to the game that started it all (sort of, the castle wolfinstein came first, but this game did the revolution). it's a fun game even today if you just want to have some fun, and it got a kind of simplicity combined with complex levels which make ths game kind of exotic. worth playing even if just for the sake of nostalgia.
