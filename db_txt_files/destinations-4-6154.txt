kentucky isn't as good as it could be but I like being able to go into forests and to be actually able to see something in fact elk are coming back to Kentucky! Kentucky holds the Derby which is also related to thunder over louisville. This is a very beautiful firework show. and the bluegrass is where you can see thourobred Hourses Trust be they are so cool@@ I recomend Kentucky to you for an all out good time. \/
