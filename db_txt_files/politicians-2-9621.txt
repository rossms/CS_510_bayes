I think Mr. Carter was a descent man, although a terrible president. Double digit inflation and interest rates coupled with high unemployment, as well as a foreign policy that was non-existent lend Mr. Carter as one of the worst presidents in the 20th century. The Iranian hostage crisis was what really did him in.
