As an actress I used to think Kirstin was horrible, always screeching and not one bit of sincerity in her performances, she used to annoy the hell out of me. That was until I saw Crazy/Beautiful. This film was enough to convince me that Kirstin has the potential to go far, not to mention how natural she was throughout. This was by far one of her best performances since Interview with a Vampire.
