This car may be UNIQUE!! Perhaps some might consider it UGLY! However, DONT KNOCK IT UNTIL YOU DRIVE IT.... It has an extraordinarly smooth ride. I was impressed. Great acceleration and handle bumpy roads well. I bought it on the spot, no questions asked. Good family and/or travelers vehicle. Take it for a spin to get the real experience as to what this SUV can offer...
