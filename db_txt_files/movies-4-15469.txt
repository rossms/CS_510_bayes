A movie about an extremely important problem: Refusing to let all human beings have basic human rights. As an Amnesty member I'm especially concerned. It's scary that the US, the country that more than any other talkes about human rights in meetings with China, Iraq, Balcan etc. is one of the worst human rights threaters! Even children can be exectuted in the US! And the worst state is Texas! If a Republican becomes president it can become even worser! :-(
