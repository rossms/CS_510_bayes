I'm not a Packer's fan but they play in the best stadium in the NFL. There is nothing better than watching a playoff game at the frozen taundra. This is the smallest market team in the entire NFL and are partially owned by the fans. THis is as good as it gets. Not to mention they have one of the greatest quarterbacks ever in Brett Farrrvvree.
