I just can't find Austin Powers funny. I like stupid humor just as much as the next person but this movie didn't make me laugh once. I might have smiled but even that took effort. The jokes are repeated over and over. It just loses the humor after the 10th time. Hurley is a nice addition to the movie for something pretty to look at to make it more bearable. I admit that sometimes comedy movies get better and better the more you watch them but I have tried to watch Austin Powers more than 3 times and I still think it is dumb.
