Right-wing masturbatory fantasy/film of the 80's, their version of "The Devil In Miss Jones." The menacing and evil Commies (Ron O'Neal, who played "Superfly" in the 70's, here plays a Cuban character based on Che Guevara, I guess) are defeated by a group of earnest high school kids who call themselves the Wolverines. If it had been made in the 40's, it would have been Archie, Jughead, Veronica and the gang taking on Hitler and Tojo. I remember sitting in the theatre at the time and thinking, "Good God, can it get any more ridiculous than this?" That was before the next Rambo film came out.
