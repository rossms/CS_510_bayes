Scream 2 is a big imrpovement over the original. First of all, we lose all of those extremly annoying characters from the original and gain some smart ones, and Neve Campbell is ready to let out one good scream at the end, and then fight the bad guy. The costumes haven't really changed, but the violence tone has, which makes it more watchable.
