My favorite fast food place--the sandwiches are always fresh, love the potato cakes (worth waiting for--they cook them fresh, and some locations won't charge extra for them). I've been to a few very dirty ones, but that's the manager, not the company's, fault. But I can't give it a 5 star rating because of these dirty locations.
