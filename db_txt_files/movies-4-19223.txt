Of course this has some shots of humor, but overall, lots of drama and horror. The first time I watched it, I screamed multiple times and just to be safe, I had to lock my doors before I slept because it was very realistic. I was expecting it to be totally scary, but they did a very good job of reviving this 1978 movie.
