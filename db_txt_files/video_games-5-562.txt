The most perfect of games. Nothing is left to chance: it is your mind against your opponent's. There is a beauty in a perfectly-executed combination which passes beyond strategy into aesthetics. Chess is a beautiful game: if you don't play yet, try it! As white I tend to play the queen pawn openings; as black I like the Sicilian or the Slav.
