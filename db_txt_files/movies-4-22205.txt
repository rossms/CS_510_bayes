A interesting story, outstanding special effects, and passable performances by Keanu Reeves and Lawrence Fishburne make this a good but not great movie. While I was entertained throughout, unlike the vast majority of reviewers on this page I did not find anything that revolutionary about the storyline. To me the plot was kind of a mishmash of Total Recall, Terminator, and Fight Club - cool stuff, but nothing to get all bent out of shape about.
