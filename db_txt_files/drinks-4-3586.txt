Gimlet has an 'L' in itt, so I remember that it is a vodka martini with a lime. A Gibson ends in 'ON', so that helps me remember that a vodka gibson is just a vodka martini with a cocktail onion in it. Old bartending trick. I like the gimlet, not a fan of the gibson. Too many of these can really get you drunnk quickly though.
