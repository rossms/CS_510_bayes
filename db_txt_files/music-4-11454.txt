ok part of the punk thing was being able to play and all that with out having to get signed by a record lable and have your music controlled by them. And that any one could have a band. Anyone could play and any one could do anything no matter how bad you sucked. And there would be no one to decide if you sucked or not. Yeah thats not explained how i wanted to explain it but you get my point i hope. Oh and i do think that the sex pistols had talent.
