Although disgustingly expensive, this car is absolutely unbeatable performance wise. How would you like to drive a car that weighs about as much as a Civic CRX and has 620hp? Thats what I thought! This car has almost perfect balance. Did you know that driver sits in the center of the front seat to further increase balance and feel? No, because those who have chosen to bash this car simply have never even seen one, or they would't attempt to bring it down, they'd be struck by its exemplary performance and good looks.
