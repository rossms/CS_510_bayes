I bought a 2000 RAM 1500 4 x 4 Sport in February 2001. New, off the show room floor. Status at 80,000 to 86,000 miles of a 10 year 100,000 mile waranty; The radiator sprung a leak, and front rotors warpped.... 1800 dollars not covered by bumper to bumbper warranty. One month later transmission failure, 2985 dollars, two weeks later transmission failure and another 1285 dollars. I bought a dodge because my 98 Ford F-150 anniversary edition lariot was stolen and people don't steal a dodge. Now I know why.
