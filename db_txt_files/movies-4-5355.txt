When I read the book as a teenager, I remember being drawn into the story because I could identify with almost all the characters. Then I saw the movie and it was like a reader's dream come true. Why have so many stories of the South won Pulitzer prizes? The yearling, Cat on a Hot Tin Roof, A streetcar Named Desire, Gone With the Wind, The Color Purple....I'm sure there are more. To Kill a Mockingbird certainly rates among the best of the winners.
