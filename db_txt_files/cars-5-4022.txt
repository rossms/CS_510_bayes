Haters. These decendants of the beasts that I drove all over creation are pretty sweet. Bad fuel economy? Yeah. Big ole billy badass looks? You got it, but if I drove one I wouldn't be compensating for anything, I just like the way it looks. To conclude this rant, this thing will drive over almost anything and its a shame I can't get one with a turret like what I drove in the Marines. Nobody would argue with any lane changes if I had 8 missles and a .50 cal on my truck!
