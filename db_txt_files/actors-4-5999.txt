I used to dislike Tom Cruise quite a bit. thought he was a smug actor, who starred in nothing but mediocre action films and piddly dramas(these INCLUDE Rainman and Born on the 4th of July) BUT over the past few years, Cruise has been able to turn his natural snuggness into some engaging performances(Jerry Maguire, Magnolia, and most recently, Vanilla Sky). Perhaps this is the start of a newer and more daring Cruise? I dont know.But, even his action films, like the upcoming Minority Reports, seem to have more weight to them.
