This is certainly the best fried chicken in the land. Super spicy, absolutely delicious. Its best on a cold fall day, when you can warm up with the red beans rice side order. The only thing bad about Popeye's is that they tend to be poorly maintained and unclean. But even in the worst of circumstances (e.g., the restaurants at the rest stops off the NJ Turnpike), the chicken is good, good, good.
