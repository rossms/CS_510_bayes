I find it humorous that people are rating Tony Blair and inserting Bush comments- Bush is no terrorist! He and Tony Blair happen to be the only men big enough to step up to the plate! I can't understand why protestors can't admit that this is all about the UN FAILING TO BACK UP ITS OWN RESOLUTIONS!!!!
