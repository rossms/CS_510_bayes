Extremely outdated SUV that was canceled for 2003. It had an old torquey V6, no V8 options, and no third row options. Reliability started off good but dwindled down to mediocre. The new Ascender has replaced the olden Trooper. The Ascender is the exact same vehcile as the Envoy XL and the Trailblazer EXT. When will GM stop making clones of thier vehicles?!
