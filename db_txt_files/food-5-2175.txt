All I can say is shame on Hershey's for taking away the Bar None. I must admit the first time I had this candy bar I didn't think I'd liked it, but I had to try it again. After the second time I was "HOOKED", so hooked I would eat at least two Bar Nones a day. It was a must that I had one. My favorite candy of all times. I was and still am in LOVE. Only to have another bite!!!
