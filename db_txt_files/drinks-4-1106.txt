Even though some of my closest friends drink it, I always laughed at people who drank Corona. I don't know if it was the clear bottle or the lime sticking out of the top when the bartender gave it to you, but whatever it was, I thought that I would never drink it on a night at the bars. Well, this past weekend I gave it a shot and I must tell you that I actually kind of liked it. It was very light and tasted pretty good due in part to the lime. I'm not sure if I will switch over to it from Bud, but I will definitely give it a second thought.
