JJ Redick is the best shooter in the game today. He is also developing into a complete player who can take over a game, knocking down dagger after dagger from the land beyond the arc...then taking it inside to draw the foul and try his luck (93%, best career mark in NCAA history) at the free throw line. If he isnt at the World Championships or at the 08 Olympics to kill the international zone defenses...then something is wrong with the selection process
