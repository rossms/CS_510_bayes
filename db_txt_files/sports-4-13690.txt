Holmgren really proved his mettle as a coach with the Packers. He is an offensive genius and his trips to the Super Bowl demand respect from his players. I also like the fact that he rides a motorcycle to and from practice when the weather is nice. This is a big year for him and the Seahawks. He has a lot of talent on both sides of the ball and anything less than a playoff appearance will be a huge disappointment.
