Simp-lay the best. A-man (as I like to call him) is dope. With the Gettysburg Addy he's tops in my book. Getting himself shot also boosted his popularity. But he WAS a great guy, with his anti-slavery laws and everything. I remember my great-great-grandpa talking about him...oh, I can still hear his voice. I LOVE ABRAHAM, AND EVERBODY ELSE SHOULD TOO!
