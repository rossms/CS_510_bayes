I loved the original version of this song the new spiced up, HipHopped version is excellent!! I even taped the Making of Lady M video. I could watch this all day long! For you haters out there, have you ever heard of PARODY? HUMOR? SATIRE? That is what the video is, in addition to being a movie prop! I love the outfits, music, vocals, choreography, makeup and everything! Very brilliant remake!!!! LADY M ROCKS as well as Mya, Pink, Lil' Kim, Christina Missy!!!! Well done! YOU GO GIRLZ!!! You ROCK and HipHop! Peep the vid if you haven't already!
