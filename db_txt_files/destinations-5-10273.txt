Bummed these off my prof one day (Ultralight Menthol) and damn they were good. Sadly only fullstrength does it for me now but I still buy a hard pack of Ultralight Menthols and relive shooting the breeze with my prof. Good times. *Update Forgot how great all the flavors were. Nudged them up. Plus the timeless nostalgia.
