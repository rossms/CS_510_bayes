on my opinion the game is too easy. it's great because you actually need to plan your steps carefully, you definetly can't just charge into a room, and the situations are greatbecause they force you to use diffrent strategies, but in general the enemies are too easy to kill. i like the news thing though, maybe rouge spear is better, i don't know, but this game was too easy for me. baisicly it's a good game though, i really recommend you to read the novel, it's one of my favorite books.
