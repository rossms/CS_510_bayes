We have a 2000 frontier 4 door, crew cab. WONDERFUL vehicle (not something to judge by cover - wonderful looking on outside and hardly to have problems). Our frontier has 130K and made two trips between west-east coats - NO PROBLEMS at all! Just had to replace brakes and tires... passed emmission test with flying colors... We think we will keep it until it reaches a million mileage. If engine blows up, replace for newer engine for like 2k to 3k. Save money!!! WONDERFUL!!!!
