This is a very interesting movie that really makes you think. It's very well-made, but it's really disturbing as well. There's a lot of graphic violence, and lots of naked people. It takes place in Britain in the early 70s when it appears everyone was stoned, and it reflects that culture. I don't really like the movie a whole lot, but that doesn't mean it's bad. Kubrick does some weird stuff, and this is up there, but he did a pretty darn good job.
