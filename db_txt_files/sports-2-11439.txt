He lost every close game except for 4. He beat Arkansas twice in close games in which he blew a HUUUUUUUGE lead only for Arkansas to run out of time, he beat Georgia last year in a close game, and he beat Vanderbilt 2 years ago in a close game. He needs to beat BOTH Vanderbilt and South Carolina to be bowl eligable (he'll lose to FSU). I would not put a dime either way in either of the 2 games.
