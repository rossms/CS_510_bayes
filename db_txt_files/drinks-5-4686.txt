Not only the original soft-drink of all time, Coke is still the best cola of all time. Pepsi is not bad, but Coke is delicious! Coke was there first, Pepsi a copy-cat. Coke and Chinese food, Coke and chocolate chip cookies, Coke and Ben Jerry's Cookie Dough Ice Cream or just ice-cold Coke by itself gulped down on a hot day. Refreshing and satisfying!
