This movie is pretty good. Before I seen the sequel (which is spectacular) I thought that the ending was kind of cheesy. But, after the seeing the sequel, I understand why they did it that way. Very good idea and very creative. The shock only happens for a few seconds, but the way the people die is awesome. If you liked this movie you will LOVE the sequel. I had to take off a star because it's not that scary. GO SEE THE SEQUEL.
