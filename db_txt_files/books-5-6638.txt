Difficult to rate something that's one-of-a-kind, as Lord of the Rings surely is. I read it first thirty years ago, have read it many times since, most recently finished it only yesterday. Its plot still keeps me gripped through the three volumes; the final pages still bring tears to my eyes. Since reading LOTR first, I've read much fantasy, enjoyed much of it, but always find myself comparing it to LOTR, usually to its detriment. Only a couple of authors have made me feel that Tolkien would appreciate their work.
