We finally got a Krispy Kreme in our area. I went this week and bought an assortment box 12 donuts. we found the donuts to be good. We would even go back now and then for more as a treat. they do not stand out as anything that special. They are just donuts like you would get at Dunkin Doughnuts, or our local Quality Dairy. A bit pricey too at $5.99 A Dozen.they have a nice variety to choose from.
