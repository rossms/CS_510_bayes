I used to buy a HUGE bag of these and go through them like they were going out of style. But now, I have basically weaned myself from them. I also used to nibble on them until they got down to the nitty gritty. And when I was younger, my aunt used them to help me learn how to swallow pills. If you like to eat them like you did when you were younger, brush your teeth and brush them good.
