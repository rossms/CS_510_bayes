I dipped back in high school quite a bit, but only Skoal because it was cheaper and I was a sissy. Then, I quit for a good year or so and started back up again with Cope. It gives a hell of a kick, and I love it! I used the long cut for a while, but in my line of work (restaurant manager) its nice to have a constant fix, so i switched to the pouches a year ago. Its harder to regulate the ammount you get, but its perfect for me, cause I can just throw it down near my molars if I have to talk to someone. Plus, I never have to take breaks to get a fix...with pouches, i always have my nicotine.
