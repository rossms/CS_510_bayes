It proves that you can in fact remake a movie, and do so here, as Rick Mornanis takes on Jack Nicholson's old role as a young man working at a plant shop, that creates a singing plant, that is really an alien from outer space that eats people. It sounds goofy, but it is a really fun musical, and has some really good motown hits in it.
