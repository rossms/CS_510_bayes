Wow, this is some amazing caramel corn! I tried the cashew version of Poppycock for the first time the other day, and it was scrumptious. The popcorn is coated very generously with a thick, sweet, buttery glaze, and cashews are sprinkled throughout. I never would've thought of adding cashews to caramel corn, but I must say it was an inspiration! This stuff leaves Fiddle Faddle and Crunch 'n Munch in the dust. Next time I'm going to try the pecan version, and I expect it to taste just as delicious.
