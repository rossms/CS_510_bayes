The state is absolutely on point. Full of beautiful safe cities like Shawnee Mission, Lenexa, and Witchita. Lawrence and Manhattan are beautiful cities to meet young people at and have lots of parties. People are truely nice and welcoming in this state and one of the best places in the union. People know how to party hard and have a good time, the frat parties I went to were awesome! Great progressive politics and nice churches too!
