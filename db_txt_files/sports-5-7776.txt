Reggie Miller is the greatest player in the history of the NBA. There is no one player and few teams that are better. He could single handedly score 200 points per game but chooses not to because of an NBA conspiracy. He can hit halfcourt shots at an amazing 98% and dunk the ball from the 3 point line. David Stern is the only reason he hasn't won a championship.
