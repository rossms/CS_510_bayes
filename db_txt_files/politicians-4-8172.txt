JFK had plenty of faults, and did embrace some really ill-advised policies (Bay of Pigs being one). He did manage to stare down the Russians over missiles in Cuba, which somewhat redeemed him in my eyes. Yeah, he's overrated for a host of reasons, but he did make yu proud to be an American (as corny as that might seem to some). I have little love or respect for the whole Kennedy clan, but JFK did instill a sense of pride (maybe even arrogance) in the average citizen - even some Republicans!
