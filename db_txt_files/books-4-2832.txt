I believe I read this two summers ago and it is one of the most gruesome stories I've ever read. I still am haunted by the images of people's flesh sliding off their bodies and a woman nursing a deceased baby that are so well described in this book. I'm sure it is an accurate account of the tragedy but I don't know if I'd ever want to read it again. And it was hard to keep track of all the different people. It jumps from story to story of a person's struggle to survive and help others to survive in the wreckage.
