The first time I watched this, I was mildly enjoyed but upon re-renting it, I discovered how blah it is. While Piper Perabo has a pretty face, she is a disgraceful actress. The plot is cheesy and overdone. It relied too much on the skin and dancing of its actresses and left absolutely no layers. I was surprised to see John Goodman in this teen travesty. Not worth it unless you're a pre-teen.
