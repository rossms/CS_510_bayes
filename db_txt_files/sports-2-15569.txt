Strictly in terms of football ability, Ray Lewis may be the best defensive player in the NFL. Nevertheless, Ray Lewis is a bad guy. He is a thug who is lucky that the league fined him only 250k. So what if he plead guilty to a misdemeanor. He was involved in a murder (albeit of two guys who certainly weren't saints) and, for many months, was more concerned with his own back than the truth.
