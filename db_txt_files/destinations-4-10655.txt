The smoke shop by my house had a bunch of half-full packs that I assume the owner had opened and smoked from. They had them in a basket with a sign indicating that you could smoke whatever you want. The fantasia was a pretty good cigarette like all Nat Sherman cigs but the packaging left a lot to be desired for me personally.
