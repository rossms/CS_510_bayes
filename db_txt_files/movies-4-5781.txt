This movie is like a great soap opera, so much happens. It was one of the first times I saw a character like Veda in a movie of this time period. Also one of the few sympathetic roles Joan did--I really like Mildred alot. I would recommend eveyone see this movie, its an amazing story for the 1940s and still holds up now.
