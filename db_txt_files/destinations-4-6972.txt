I just spent some time in Italy and thought Rome was nice but not for me. The ancient and religous history contained within one single city is amazing...the artwork in the Vatican, St. Peter's, the Forum, the Senate. However, I found it very crowded and noisy and almost got run over by mopeds every five minutes. I think that Tuscany has much more to offer...Florence and Siena are beautiful and quite cultural and the food and people of the Tuscany are much more appealing.
