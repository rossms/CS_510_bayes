Used to be the Washington Senators until they moved here in '61, were generally weak in the capital but did have some fine clubs in the 20's and early 30's. Have won 2 Series and had some competitive teams since moving to this city. They don't play in a particularly big market, their owner is a 657 year old cheap ass who made a fortune on foreclosures ( nice guy huh?) and while they won a weak division several times in the years prior to their 3rd place finish in '05, should have trouble fending off the greatly improved Chicago again, and also Cleveland in '06 .
