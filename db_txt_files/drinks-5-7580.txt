I've tried many, many, many vodka's and came across this one by chance while in SF. Look no further. This stuff is better than anything out there. Period. Better than Charodei, Stoli Crystal, Ketel One, Grey Goose, Shaker's, etc. etc. Try for yourself and be convinced. Nose is great, mouthfeel is velvety with a slight hint of the grain, and the finish is flawless. Smoothest I've ever come across. They're somehow able to conserve lots of flavor and stay smooth. Usually you give up one for the other, but not with Charbay. Super clean with the flavour. Amazing for a vodka!
