Good actor with a commanding presence. Can play drama or comedy well and does a good job in all the roles he takes. He's been in some solid, good movies and I cant think of too many bombs. Has had a nice career and I think he'll continue to do great work and someday hit it big in a movie that will elevate him into the Great catagory.
