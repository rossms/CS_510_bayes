This one was pretty good. One of my favorates as a kid but now it's not all that great . Not hilariously funny. I like the wide use of cartoon characters from Disney and Warner Bros. It has everything and everyone from Bugs Bunny to Mickey Mouse. Those weasels that are after Roger Rabbit are also pretty cool. I'm not positive but I think Christopher Lloyd plays the bad guy villian boss.
