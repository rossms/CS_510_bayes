Most underrated coach in the NBA. If the Wolves had played in the Eastern Conference, which geographically would make more sense, playing with Chicago, Milwaukee, etc., they'd have gotten homecourt advantage, even the #1 seed in the playoffs, every year, but in the West, never got home court advantage, and usually had to play the #1 or #2 seed, in the West, too, and the West has dominated since Saunders started up.
