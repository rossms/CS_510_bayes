This guy was the best clutch playoff pitcher ever and one of baseball's best competitors ever. If I had to have one pitcher pitch one game for my life, he would be the one I would want on the mound. He holds the World Series strike out record (17 in one game) and has some insane World Series record (8-1 with eight or nine complete games I believe).
