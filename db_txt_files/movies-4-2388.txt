Pretty good film- somewhat predictable, not terribly remarkable but with good suspense and action. I'm still laughing while I'm writing about this- towards the end of the movie, Jodie's husband Steven comes to save the day but he gets kicked around by the thieves and Jodie practically ties him to a chair and gives him a gun. I don't know why, but it was so amusing to see him in that chair with his eyes swollen shut trying to threaten the thieves. I have an unusual attraction towards Jodie Foster's tomboy daughter , Kristen Stewart, naturally making it a good movie.
