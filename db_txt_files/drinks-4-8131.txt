Valpolicella is almost always a good wine; it really depends on the year as to how good it is. It's tough to go wrong with Bolla's Valpolicella, as it is hard to go wrong with almost any of the wines from the area around Verona and Lake Garda (i.e., Bardolino red and Soave white, not to mention almost any Recioto from the region).
