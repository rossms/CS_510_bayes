This is a good store. I like the food selection and can find almost anything I need there. I went to Walmart looking for a tonneu cover for my truck and asked a person if they could find the one I needed in the back and was told no way. So after I complained and got thaqt rude employee in hot water I went to Mejier and asked the same question and the person went to the back and brought me out the one I needed and even helped me carry it outside. They have pretty good customer service.
