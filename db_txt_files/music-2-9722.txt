Wasn't this supposed to be a CD of Mariah's #1 hits? If some songs on this Cd are #1's then the people that ranked the songs had serious problems. Now, there are a FEW good songs. But overall, it is awful. This CD is not one to listen to for a long time. You might die of boredom. The only reason it gets two stars is because she actually has the effort to keep on putting out CD's for us to make fun of. There is only one CD in the whole wide world that is deserving of one star. That is Macy Gray's I Try CD. She has such an extremely annoying voice that it makes me, and all my friends, run to get our earplugs.
