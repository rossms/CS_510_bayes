UGGGH!!! way too many tourists milling about to have an enjoyable experience here. i know that the whole point of this place is to attract tourists, but good god! good luck pushing your way through the crowds on a weekend day. as with most touristy spots, i would reccommend going later in the evening if you want to enjoy yourself. not to mention, hollywood looks much better at night. for some real entertainment, drive down santa monica blvd and look at the tranny hookers.
