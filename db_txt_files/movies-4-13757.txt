The acting was excellent but the story line sort of caught me off guard. I didn't lot about the movie when I saw it and when it ended up to be a story about a man w/ special powers, I was a little disappointed. I think it was because I thought it would be something that people could relate to in some way, but it wasn't. Although I was slightly disappointed, it was still a good movie.
