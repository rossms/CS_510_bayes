The best car we've ever owned, an '01 Avalon. Super reliable, very smooth. An almost Lexus. Engine so quiet you have to check the tach. This thing cranks out 25-30 mpg at 70mph in super comfort. The only negative thing is the steering is much too light when on the highway. The 2005 Avalon looks even better with a new 280 hp mill.
