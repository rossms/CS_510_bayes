LT is the best running back in the league. He has the best vision for a back, great blocker, a good reciever at the slot, and has probably the best speed:power ratio. Ray Lewis said he has the best moves in the league. Last year he racked up 2,360+ yards from scrimmage, that's 2nd best ever behind Marshall Faulk's 1,000 yards rushing and recieving. The only reason he only had 1,300 yards this season was his groin injury, which he played through 9 games through the season. Just imagine running with a groin injury! This guy has true heart.
