I have said it before, and I shall say it again....Caramello bars are the best damn candy bars EVER. I can't believe that people actually think that 100 Grand's are better. I shiver at the thought. If I could, I would crush up a Caramello, cook it down, transfer the mixture to a needle, and inject myself throughout the day when I need a fix.
