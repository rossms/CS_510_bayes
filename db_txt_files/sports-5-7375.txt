The best center of all time. The star of one of the dominant college teams of the 80s, first overall draft pick (ahead of Jordan), dominant player for years, and then, in the mid-90s, had one of the greatest stretches of individual play in NBA history. Schooled David Robinson, Karl Malone, Shaquille O'Neal, Charles Barkley, and on, and on and on, in the playoffs. Just embarrassed people with how good he was, on both sides of the court. Shaq will always have getting schooled by Hakeem as part of his legacy. He never returned the favor.
