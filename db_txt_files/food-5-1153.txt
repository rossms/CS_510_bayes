Peanut M M's are better than plain M M's. They are very good, extremely addictive, and fun to eat. A very good treat while at the movies, but if you worry about fat content, don't buy one of the giant movie theater-size bags...before you realize what you've done, you'll have eaten the entire bag (this usually occurs during the previews, before the movie even starts, dammit!).
