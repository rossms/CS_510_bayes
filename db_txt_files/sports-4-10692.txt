Great Coach, his first 3 seasons. When you take Miami to 2 straight NC games its not surprising, but when u enter your 3rd season your expected to make it to 3 straight, but a BCS bowl isn't bad, its great. Then that 4th season comes and you go 9-3 its good but not whats's expected watch for another 8-3 season with that treacherous road schedule (at Clemson, at FSU, at VT) watch for 2 out 3 losses in those games.
