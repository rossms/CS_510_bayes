Ocho Rios is one place we don't plan on returning too (we did NOT stay are a private resort). The people there were rude and they seemed very unreceptive to visitors. I did enjoy the falls and the beaches would have been great had it not been for the trash and people everywhere trying to sell us something. Jamaica in general has a more impoverished population then most other Island destinations. I would suggest you go somewhere else like St. Thomas, Barbados, St. Lucia or Tortolla, if you thinking about a trip to the Caribbean.
