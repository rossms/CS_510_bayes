This movie made me cover my eyes half the time. You couldn't blink! Sometimes, the plot would wander, but it's easy to follow the story. Although, some parts don't make sense, or didn't really have anything to do with the movir it was still an overall good movie. I got scared and now I dread the day I have to ride in a plane.
