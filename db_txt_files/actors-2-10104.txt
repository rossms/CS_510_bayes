I'm sick of Goldie Hawn. She bugs me. I really liked her in a couple of older movies (Foul Play, Seems Like Old Times), but she became progressively more annoying. Private Benjamin was OK, but then she did Protocol (just a lame movie), Overboard (another lame movie), Bird on a Wire (where she screamed like an idiot the whole time), and Housesitter (a bad movie with a stupid premise). Her ditsy but sweet blond act doesn't seem to age well.
