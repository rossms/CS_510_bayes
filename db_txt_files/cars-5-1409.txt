Kitty likes to go fast. 4.2L V8 and my combined mileage is 18I can live with that when I drive it like it was stolen. It doesnt mater what age, people love the style, the class, and the cat leaping from the bonnet! Ive had benz, bimmer, and Volvonone have gotten me as lucky as this oneif you know what I mean? Pretentiouswho cares? I love the wood, the leather, the style. I would, however, like a different color on the dash that the green, maybe user definable for the orange bimmer lovers or the blue vw? I an already on the list for the 07 XKoh yeah babybe have!!!
