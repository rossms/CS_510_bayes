The biggest thing about Oklahoma is the fact that they don't bother to clean it up. So manyo the houses & buildings......even the ones they brag about are either run down looking or certainly nothing spectacular. I'm very visually affected so I have a hard time looking at how they don't bother to keep up the neighborhoods and the streets. Lots of carports, shantys, flat houses, etc. But if you drive out into the country where it's unspoiled and not trashy & dirty looking where the people live....it's much better.
