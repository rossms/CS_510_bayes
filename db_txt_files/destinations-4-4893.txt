I would give it a five, except for the society there that has an attitude problem. They really have to do something about the crime and poverty. Parts of the city are worse and should be avoided. The candelaria, Monserrate and some older neighbourhoods like Tesquilla (bad spelling) are worth seeing. The one time Athens of South America is worth seeing, but it is probably not a good time to go right now. They should do something about their railway system. s
