I know cars pretty well being the son of a car dealer (old AMC Jeep). I have bought two Saturn SL's and they have been very reliable. True, they are small and noisy, but for basic transportation and low cost of owenership, I will be looking for Saturn again. AND, it appears to me that Saturn book value is overstated. The are hard to sell for book. Bad news if you are selling but a good opportunity if you are buying. Just make a a low ball offer to an individual selling and chances are he/she will jump. They won't like it but they will jump.
