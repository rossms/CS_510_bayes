Alright.. I know this sounds terribly narrow and hypocritical, but you know, now that I think about it, most of the reason I don't like this book is because my diluted self-nullifying communist college professor, whose entire curricula for every class consisted solely of convoluted conspiracy theories, insisted that we read it. I might have given it a chance had some other more down-to-earth professor made me buy it. But no, I just can't bring myself to buy into anything she subscribes to.
