Newcastle Brown Ale is a solid darker beer for those who like a less bitter, more sweet, nutty aftertaste. It doesn't beat a Guiness, but many drinkers cannot handle or do not prefer a stout. The biggest problem with Newcastle is that the beer does not taste good when switching between different kinds of beers in one sitting. In other words, either stick with the Brown Ale for the evening or stay away completely.
