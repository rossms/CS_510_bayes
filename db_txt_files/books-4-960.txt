this is the most confusing book of the series. especially because of the gap between this book and the last ones, i found i had to read them all again in order to place some of the things in this one into context with the others. I like how this book and the one before it took a dark turn, not everything in HP universe is hunky dory, and it had a very sad ending. I guess Harry had to learn that he can't always get what he wants, but at such a terrible cost?
