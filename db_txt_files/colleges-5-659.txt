I am an ardent Husky fan. UConn has far exceeded all of my expectations thus far. The school is very well-respected, and is regarded as the crown jewel of the UConn system, with the Social Work, Education, Med/Dentistry schools not far behind. I just wanted to express how impressed I have been with the caliber of students here. In our 1L class, every Ivy is represented, aside from UPenn (but there is a 2L from there). Note to the timid: the Socratic method is alive and well here.
