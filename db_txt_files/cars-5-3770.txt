this is not doubt the best off-roading car out there right now. if the military uses it than that means that it is a great off-roading car. it is desgined so that you dont get any problems in ten yrs! if you do your normal oil change your hummer will go ten yrs without a problem! i will personaly buy one in about four yrs. so i can go hunting in the mountains.
