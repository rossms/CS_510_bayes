It's guys like Houston who demonstrate how good the talent in the NBA really is. Here is a guy who is 6'5 , and unbelievably athletic. He also happens to have one of the prettiest jump shots on the planet, and can handle the ball. He is smart, a team player, and knows how to play within a system. Yet, even with all of these unbelievable gifts, he is still only a good (but not great) player in this league. It blows me away.
