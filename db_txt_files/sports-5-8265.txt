No matter what anybody says Shaq is the undisputed scary center you dont want to face while running to though the paint. He dose everything and his free throw shooting has developed into an excelent one (if you compare it with years before). Anybody who says the contrary has something against the man. Nobody can say anything bad about the player. End of the story. p.s. ASk Allen Iverson
