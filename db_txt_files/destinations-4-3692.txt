i have lived in denver for several months now; overall, i like it a lot. there are really cool people here without the snobbyness you would get from many major cities. the weather alone cannot be beat as well as the scenery. there is great music, shops/restaurants, and great outdoor activities.....the only draw-backs for me is that denver is kind of in the middle of nowhere and not close to any major body of water, which would make it a 5 star city in my book. homelessness and some sleazy areas are also a big problem but i guess this is w/any big city. anyway, cool city overall. cya
