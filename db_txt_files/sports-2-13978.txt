First, none of the players on thisw list are bad. But I have to rate them by comparison. Sanders had some of the best seasons ever. But he also had games where he lost yardage, and couldn't cxarry the team. But what really bothers me is that he quit on the Lions. Why? Because it's all about Barry. And as far as I'm concerned, there's no I in team.
