J Crew offers clothes with a simple elegance that will never go out of style. The lines of the clothing are straight and clean. I always feel well dressed and put together when I wear anything from J Crew. I look forward to each new season and find that they simply out do themselves each time. You can go from casual to dressed up for any elegant occassion. Anyone that finds J Crews style to be "boring" and "the same old thing" is perhaps boring themselves.
