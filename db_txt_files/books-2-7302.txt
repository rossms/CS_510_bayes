They have a decent amount of info but there's something annoying about the tone, like the writers are way too caught up in their own coolness. Look beyond that and you'll find some glaring errors...one section in their England chapter was copied out of a tourist brochure. And the problem of how the hostels written up in Let's Go tend to fill up, is very real.
