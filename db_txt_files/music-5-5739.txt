It does not quite reach the same greatness as Blizzard of Ozz. However, Diary of A Madman is a good album none the less. Ozzy's same band lineup (including the great Randy Rhoads) from Blizzard is still together and still in full form. Classics run throughout this album just like the first one (Over the Mountain, Flying High Again, Believer). Some songs are just not as powerful as the ones in Blizzard and that's why it's not as great. Yet, the stellar musicianship and signing is still there. You won't be sorry spening your money on this disc.
