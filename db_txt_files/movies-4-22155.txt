This movie was extremely imaginative and filled with revolutionary special effects. The plot was rather interesting and the character development was perfectly fine. I rated this movie a 4 because it lacked on key element... a decent lead actor. Keanu Reeves was not an ideal choice for the hero. He lacks the personality and the charisma to pull off a enlightened world saving hero. The fight scenes are excellent but the main character drags the movie into disbelief. I personally find it much harder to believe Keanu Reeves doing Kung Fu than robots taking over the world.
