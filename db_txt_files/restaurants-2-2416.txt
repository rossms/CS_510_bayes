JITB recently expanded into my area of the country. Hearing all the hype that surrounded it, I thought a trip to JITB was in order. I was disappointed, but gave them 2 more chances. It didn't get any better. The food didn't really taste that much better than McDonald's, and the prices weren't reasonable at all. The one saving grace is their good milkshakes. I can't speak for their other menu items (tacos, chicken), but for a hamburger, you'd be better off going elsewhere.
