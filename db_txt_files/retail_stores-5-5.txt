I am a Denver native, and have been going to Tattered Cover my entire life. It is a fantastic store (especially the Cherry Creek location). It's a great place to go and spend an afternoon reading and shopping. They encourage reading with their many couches and comfortable chairs all over the store. They have every book imaginable, and can order anything for you. If you are ever visiting Denver, it is worth a visit!
