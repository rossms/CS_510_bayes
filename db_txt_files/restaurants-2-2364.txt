I'm not really sure what to rate this place because to be honest I don't think I've seen one in at LEAST 15 years. Are they still around? However, I did eat at a couple when I was a child and they still had some presence at it was not really very good. Fish just doesn't seem to keep, even in decent conditions, as well as things like beef or chicken and I'm pretty sure that fast food restaurants aren't really know for their good conditions . Besides, from the fact that I haven't seen one in 15 years I feel it's safe to assume it wasn't that good to begin with.
