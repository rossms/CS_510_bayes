A Lot has changed with Bank One. It now has a new CEO who's primary focus is customer service. I have been a Bank One customer for three years and am very satisfied. Remember...you pay for what you get. Yeah, some fees do apply, but you get a bank that's open late..on weekends...interstate locations...and as for as community banks with only one location in town...there's a reason their accounts are free- to compensate for inconvenience.
