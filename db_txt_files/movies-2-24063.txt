With # 5 and # 9, forms the Really Bad Existentialist Trilogy. Here, a computer looks for God, and one of the cheesiest resolutions result. Otherwise, it has a very good score, the coolest Trek warp speed effect, and the best Trek movie opening sequence of all time. After that, though, the movie drags a lot and generally starts to fall apart. I like the movie more for what it could have been than what it is, and the soundtrack is great. A special edition DVD was released in Nov 2001 with new effects and stuff. Whether that really improves it or not, I have no idea yet.
