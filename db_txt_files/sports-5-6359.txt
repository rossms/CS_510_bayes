I hate to say it, but Duke is the ultimate college basketball program. Consistently dominant, year in and year out - even after steadily losing underclassmen to the pros - and with perhaps the classiest coach in the game. The 2001 team is no exception either; with Williams and Battier they have perhaps the two best players in the country, and who knows how good Dunleavy could be if he got more touches. If only Duke students weren't elitist, prep school punks - I might actually root for this team.
