One of the fastest-growing cities in America (about a 1.25% annual increase), Sioux Falls is also one of the most underrated cities. It's businessman's dream - low commercial taxes, a hub of many national businesses (Citibank, Qwest, John Morrell, just to name a few) and is the biggest city between Seattle and Minneapolis. It is trying to lure the Minnesota Vikings to move their training camp to Howard Wood field in Sioux Falls (it's still in Mankato, MN for the time being) and is a great place for the outdoors-types to live - excellent fishing, hunting, and golfing all within short driving distances.
