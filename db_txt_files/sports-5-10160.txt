44-6 over the last 4 years, 24-0 in the WAC over the last 3 years. This man can flat out coach. It doesn't matter at what level a person coaches or who their opponents are, it is tough to sustain a winning pct. like Dan Hawkins has. He's been a winner wherever he as gone. Hawk is a great coach and more importantly, he's a great person.
