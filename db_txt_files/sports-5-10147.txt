Anyone who rates this man less than a five is an idiot. His overall record was 165-29-10 at Michigan. While at Michigan, he won 56 straight games from 1901-1905 (and every championship therein). During that span, Michigan outscored opponents 2,821 to 42. That's an average of scoring 50.375 points a game, while allowing .75 points a game; that is absurd. Imagine winning every game 50 - 0 for 5 seasons.
