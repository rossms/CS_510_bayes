I liked it quite a bit. They do tinker with historical fact a little, but that's to be expected. Pretty tough to fit a story like this into the constraints of 150 to 180 minutes. Orlando Bloom is good, but the charecter comes off as a bit too perfect. It misses the grit of Gladiator or Braveheart. A little trivia: Ed Norton plays Jerusalem's King Baldwin, though you never see his face.
