This is a pretty cool store. I used to pretty much only shop here. Now, I'm branching out a lot more, but I still like Old Navy. I don't like the loud music, but at least the clothes they sell don't make you look like a slut. The missing star is for the music and the inconsistent sizing. I got size 4 regular length stretchy midnight blue jeans, and I went back to get more in a different color, and they were not just too small, but too small in different proportions. But for the prices... Hey, it's more than I can expect!
