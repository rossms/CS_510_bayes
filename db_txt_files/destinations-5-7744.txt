I'm a confessed Market Rat. When I worked in the Financial District, we'd pop down for lunch, drinks after work, etc. Some pretty interesting shops, and a great people watching spot. Also, great food spots from a couple of Todd English's places to fast food. There's also a comedy club upstairs in the Market that has a good schedule of local and national talent.
