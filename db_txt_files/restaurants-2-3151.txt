I'm not crazy about Columbo Frozen Yogurt. There's something about the texture and flavor of the yogurt I just don't like. It seems to have too much air in it or something, making it kind of Styrofoamy. I haven't found any flavors that stand out either. If given a choice of Columbo Frozen Yogurt or no dessert at all, I'd go hungry.
