Ok heres to all the crappers. I work for Sonic in TX. WE DO NOT recycle food. As far as health issues are concerned we have much higher standards than anyone and on our guest service. That is why we check back to see if anything else is needed. Granted one time u eat may not be satisfactory but can u think of anywhere you go, where it is always as good or better than before?
