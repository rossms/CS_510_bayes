Prague is great, but I can't agree that it is a hidden jewel anymore. It has been discovered by American backpackers and German tourists in a big way. It feels more like a large museum than an actual living city. But it is one beautiful museum if I do say so myself. Surely worth a visit. But if you want to visit a true, living city in that part of the world, go to Budapest.
