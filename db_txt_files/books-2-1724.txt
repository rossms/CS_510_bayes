KEVIN KELL A prime example of the pathetic fallacy, a tendency to imbue the natural world with human feeling. Stacked up against now-almost-forgotten classic comic strips like Polly and Her Pals or Abbie 'n' Slats, it doesn't quite make the grade. It's more sentimental and cutesy than genuinely humorous, and its one-note satire of corporate greed is facile at best. I'm not quite sure it represents much of an improvement over supposedly anodyne strips like the asinine For Better or Worse.
