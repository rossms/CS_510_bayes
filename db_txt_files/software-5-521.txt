Has always been the word processing program of choice for my needs. Easy to learn and easy to use. Love the popup thesarus on the newer version I'm using at work ... just right click a word and you get a handy little list of alternates. And here's some good news for Princess Bride - you can actually de-select the office helper feature and also make Word stop correcting and changing everything automatically. And to Callmetootie - yes, I suppose it would be conceivable to think of Mary Shelley using Word. However, the early 19th century version was more than likely a quill pen and parchment.
