I thought this was about to knock off Field of Dreams as my favorite movie ever through about the first hour. But then it slowed down, and now it probably wouldn't make my top 10. It's a goofy no-stop action packed Hitchcock thriller. How a television producer managed to overcome all of those obstacles is beyond me.
