I loved my Kia at first, got lots of compliments on the stylish look BUT... with less than 30,000 miles on it I have had it in for service almost 10 times - 5 times for air conditioner thermostat, headlight burned out, key broke in half (and I had to pay $14 to replace it!!) and now the power steering unit is leaking badly and they can't seem to fix it (I've had it in 3 times for this problem in 3 weeks) it is in the shop now trying to see if they can fix it and as soon as I get it back I am trading it in... not on another KIA!!!
