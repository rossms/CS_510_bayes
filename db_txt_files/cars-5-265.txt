this machine is great, i have a 1989 300 4x4 version and it has had very few problems even after being used and abused. the only thing i would change on it is the location of the air intake because it is very low and restrics how deep of water that you can cross. it is located right under the seat. they might have changed it in the newer models however. over all the bayou is a great machine for kids and beginners and is easy to handle.
