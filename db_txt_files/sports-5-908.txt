Bernie Williams did so much for the Yankees during the playoffs and the World Series. He seems like such a lay-low kinda guy, you never know what to expect with him. Put a bat in his hands with runners on base and you got a good chance of that winning run. He is a good baseball player and deserves everything he earns.
