First of all, without Robin Williams this movie wouldn't have been nearly as good as it is. It's probably the best voice-over ever heard in an animated movie. (The best voice-over ever done was James Earl Jones as Darth Vader in the original Star Wars trilogy, but I digress.) The story and animation are the usual Disney finest, but it somehow doesn't have the real heart that some of them have. Of course, the story really doesn't lend itself to that, like Beauty and the Beast, Little Mermaid, or Lady and the Tramp, but it's certainly appealing enough.
