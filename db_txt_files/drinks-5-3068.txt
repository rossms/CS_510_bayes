BURN really is the best energy drink out there. No sacrifice in quality. No high fructose corn syrup like the top brands (the ones with the big $$$), plenty of vitamins, and of course, 38mg more than Red Bull, Sobe Adrenaline, and AMP. Oh yeah and it is drinkable. It actually tastes awesome. I don't see why this drink isn't the most popular out there. Try it once and you'll agree!!!
