I love Springfield! I grew up in a small town, and have no desire to live in a great big city, so Springfield is the perfect compromise. And the people OF ALL AGES on SMSU's campus made me feel welcome. And the recruiting efforts on campus have already scored me 4 job offers, and I don't graduate until May. I'm not sure yet, but I think I'm accepting the position here in Springfield, because I want to have a family some day, and what a great place to raise kids! (I'm in a good mood today, can you tell?)
