They aren't that bad from what I remember, but where did they go? My family -7 people- used to go there a lot because they always had those pizza pack deals and we ate there a lot and they were pretty good. Iused to live in MO and then they disappeared. And I don't see them anywhere here in VA. Its like they disappeared or closed down a lot of chains. I wonder what happened...
