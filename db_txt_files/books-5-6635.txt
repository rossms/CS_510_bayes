The Greatest Book of its time and now. This book is an imazing book filled with everything a good book needes. The characters are in their own way either perfect or close to it. They all have their own way for everything and somehow these peoples work out their differences of race, fighting style, and rank (example Aragorn=King) The book is fantastic!
