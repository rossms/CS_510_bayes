You'd have to be pretty desperate to enjoy this extremly corny and goofy musical. The movie is extremly slow-paced and at times a bit silly. The acting is pretty mad, even considering the year it was made. The only good thing about this movie is the settings, that are barely noticeable because of how badly the camerawork was.
