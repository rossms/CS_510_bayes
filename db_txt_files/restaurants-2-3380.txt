Godfather's Pizza has the worst crust in the world. It is such a phony of a crust. Toaster Breaks Frozen Pizza Bars have better crusts then Godfather's has. I would have Godfather's Pizza a lot because when I was younger, I had a friend named Meghan and her father worked, and he hated his job, he said he was laid off, and stuff like that.
