Nice costumes, very drawn out story though. A beautiful boring movie. Has some nudity (if you're not a big fan of that, you might want to avoid this), mild violence (not as violent as many other films). I didn't like it, but my fiance' loves it, so maybe I'm just picky (at least that's what he says).
