I grew up on Taco Cabana in San Antonio and still think they've got the best fajitas around. These aren't the sirloin or shrimp fajitas that TGI/AppleBennigans serve. These are REAL fajitas. TC was serving fajitas back before the vast majority of americans had ever HEARD of them. They're the original TexMex 24-hour taco stand and they're awesome. Yes their prices have gone up, but they're still cheap and tasty. Good stuff.
