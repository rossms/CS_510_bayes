Amazing fx, creative story. Almost too creative -- even in a sci-fi mindset, some of the logic gaps were hard to get past. Still, an incredibly fun movie. Seems part of an trend where puffball actors put in good performances in interesting movies (a la Brad Pitt in Fight Club). Super fab kung-fu scenes, too.
