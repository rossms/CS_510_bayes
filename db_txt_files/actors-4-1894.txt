I generally have little time for actors and actresses. Most of them are a bunch of loved-up egomaniacs who'd go to the opening of an envelope so long as they could have their mug shots taken for 'Hello' magazine. So, respect to Depp for not being part of that scene and for taking on quirky roles that don't enhance his pretty boy image. He also made a cameo appearance in UK sketch show 'The Fast Show'. So he doesnt take himself that seriously then. Respect to the geezer.
