The fact that a few guys can get together and write songs that not only truly rock, but are also quite intelligent restores my faith that not all rock stars are in a constant pot cloud. This album defines rock and forwards it into a whole new genre of poetic rock. It's a perfect combination of hard core and cleverness. I can only look forward to their next album.
