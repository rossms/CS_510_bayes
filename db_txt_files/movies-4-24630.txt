I never saw the original and I think that contributed to me enjoying this film more than others. For me, it didn't have to live up to anything else. As everyone has said, the make-up and effects were absolutely unbelievable. That alone makes the movie worth seeing. And, I thought the acting and script were passable (particularly compared to Pearl Harbor, another big budget, great effects movie). Granted, the ending left you with a lot of questions (most importantly, what the hell happened?), but overall I would recommend it.
