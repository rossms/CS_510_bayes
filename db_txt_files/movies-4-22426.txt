I must say after seeing this movie i was a little dissapointed....it certainly came out dry .....but i thought the special effects were amazing, true lucas work. To be truly honest i only went to see the movie because hayden christensen was in it! And i never knew anakin had such strong feelings for the senator...isn't she a little old for him?....i mean, she was a teenager when he was just a small boy.....
