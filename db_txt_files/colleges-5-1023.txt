so sad all of you who screwed up in high school and didn't get into the school you felt you deserved to get into. My brother got into Princeton and he isn't rich (he got financial aid), he works hard, he is extremeley curious and has always done alot of public service. His mode of transport is a bike. He did get a 1600 on his SAT's without a course. He did get perfect scores or nearly perfect on most of his SAT II's. AND- he did like Princeton, because it was an undergraduate focused school that pours resources into bright curious kids who work hard.
