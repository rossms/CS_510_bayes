I have a 93 cx hatch bach and my wife has a 95 dx coupe. Both great reliable cars with great gas milage. Personally I have broken 50mpg several times in the 2 years I have owned it. The only problem that either of us have had is when I had to replace the original battery on the car lst week. (I was surprised it still had the original battery in it). The Civic is a great car for people who don't want to worry about their vehicle.
