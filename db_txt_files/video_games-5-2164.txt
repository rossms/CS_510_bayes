The spectacular Mario Kart series continued with style and substance on its second installment on the Nintendo 64. Although the riders were sprite-based, the courses were spectacularly polygonal and also filled with both creative new vistas and references to games of Mario past. The music was also very Mario-like and of course the sound effects were classic. With great single-player and even better multiplayer (such as the uber-fun Battle Mode), Mario Kart 64 certainly set the standard for racing games at the time--a standard that other games like Gran Turismo could not possibly reach.
