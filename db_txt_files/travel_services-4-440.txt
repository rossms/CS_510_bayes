I wonder how many of the people criticising Aeroflot have ever actually flown with them. Having taken about 40 flights on Aeroflot in the past three years, to many places in Europe and Asia, I can say they are underrated. Sure economy on the Tupolevs is not too comfortable but on the western aircraft it is ok, and Business Class is fine. OK not as luxurious all-round as leading western airlines, but quite reasonable and good value.
