Cozumel is incredibly over-tourized, but the diving is underated. Before leaving for Cozumel I was told by dozens of people that this was not an ideal diving spot -- boy were they wrong. The visibility was as good as I've had three days in a row, and the fish and coral and mmarine life in general were great. But beware, even the dive shops cater to tourists -- some are a bit thick on the cheese.
