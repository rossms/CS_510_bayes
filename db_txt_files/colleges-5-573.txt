As a current Purdue Engineering student, I would have to say being here gives me a great advantage. As I prepare to graduate in a few months, I already have a job (even in a weak job market), and I actually had to turn down two other offers. Purdue provided me with a lot of opportunities to interact with companies, and its reputation in the working world is impeccable.
