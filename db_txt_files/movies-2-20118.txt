I gave the Blair Witch Project a 2. When this movie came out in certain theatres, I was really excited to watch it. However, after watching it, I thought they could have made a better storyline. I think the writer should have made the movie scarier. Another reason why I didn't like this movie was because it gave me a headache from the way it was shot.
