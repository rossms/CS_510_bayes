There is no question that Ruth is the best ever. As a pitcher, he won 94 games with a 2.28 ERA, and was 3-0 as a World Series pitcher for the Redsox. He also had back-to-back 20 game winning seasons. Who can hold a candle to Ruth as a slugger (.690 Slugging Average, nearly 60 points ahead of No 2 Williams). With a lifetime batting average of .342, 714 home runs, 2213 RBI's, and a 8.50 home run percentage, this man was unbelievable!
