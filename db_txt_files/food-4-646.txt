Believe it or not, I used to eat this cereal quite a bit when I was younger. In recent years, they've begun marketing Special K to women and so it has taken on the role of Chick Cereal. It actually has a good taste; it's like eating a better-tasting version of Corn Flakes. I'd buy some, but now I'm embarassed to be seen leaving the store with it.
