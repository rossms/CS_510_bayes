I can't really call this a drama. It's a romantic comedy. I still give it 4 stars. I really enjoyed Cusak, which was for me a rarity. The whole pulled together by fate hits home for me. (I met my wife in a chat room and we've been together 7 years!) Somehow this kind of reminds me of how things that are meant to be will be, no matter what. Good wholesome movie. Molly Shannon was a riot, even though she played another typical Molly Shannon character.
