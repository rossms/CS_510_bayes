Power pitchers are flashy and seem to get all the headlines just as power hitters do. Maddux is one of the best pitchers I have ever enjoyed seeing in person. His failures in the post season are worth noting and almost give me cause to rate him a 4. Good pitching is suppose to beat good hitting but the Braves have apparently shattered that time tested belief over the past 10+ years.
