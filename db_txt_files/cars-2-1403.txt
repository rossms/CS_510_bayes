People, if the Millenia is such a great car, why has it been canceled for 03? The Millenia is very unreliable. Guess who ownes Mazda? Ford ownes it, the company who is reffred to Fix Or Repair Daily. (which isnt true) The Lexus ES300, Acura TL and Mercedes C240 are inferior products compared to the Millenia.
