To give credit where it's due, his ability to take down and out teams and return them to playoff form in a very short timeframe, truelly speaks volumes about his coaching ability. He is a stern disciplinarian in an era of flip phones and laxidazical attitudes. I didnt notice many silly end zone celebrations from the Boys this year.
