Roy Williams is a class act who runs a great program. A high percentage of his players graduate, his teams win even when he doesn't have much talent to work with, and his assistant coaches regularly go on to take over other programs. As a Kansas fan, it frightens me when I hear rumors about other big programs trying to lure him away from the Jayhawks. KU should do whatever it takes to keep him happy.
