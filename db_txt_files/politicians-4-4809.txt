I admit, I don't know this man very much. But I do know that he supports a flat tax which I would be totally comfortble with. Why should the most productive people in society foot the highest share of taxes? The top 5% pay more than half of all taxes. I don't care much about his personality or his speaking skills, I just like some of his ideas. Unlike most politicians, Forbes will stand for what he thinks is right, not what he thinks will win popularity contests. Forbes did poorly in the elections, mainty because he was under constant attack from the liberal media.
