This is a great cheese, but is it alot like nuclear energy. Powerful, dangerous in the wrong hands, but very good if used properly. Use it as a garnish with pears, pasta (especially fettuccine alfredo or penne) or deli meats like prosciutto. But BEWARE!!! This cheese has a powerful smell not unlike dirty socks, and it is best used sparingly. There is a fine balance here. All in all, a good cheese eaten fresh or cooked.
