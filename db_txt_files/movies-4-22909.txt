This is a good movie as science fiction/fantasy goes.When the movie first came out, it was excellent, given the special effects pioneering that was just getting into process at the time. Movies with much better special effects are topping each other every month now, but are they good MOVIES, or do the special effects try to overshadow a poor story, and worse writing? Close Encounters must rate as one of the five 'original' science fiction/fantasy movies the brought us into the special effects age. A good Stephen Spielberg escapist movie.
