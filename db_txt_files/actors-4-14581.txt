Mercy, I flipped ass-over-elbow for her in ALEX MACK, and watched my legs jellify during her guest-flashes on 3RD ROCK. Then suddenly.....nothing (like someone tripped over her power lead-in). You can't tell me LaLaLand had nothing for a bright, energetic young lady to do. NOTE TO THE SUITS: Please deal her back into picture!!
