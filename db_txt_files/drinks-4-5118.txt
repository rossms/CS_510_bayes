Great product, bad marketing. C'mon, Britney Spears and the 15-minutes-of-fame Osbournes? Any celebrity is bad marketing, but that just sets the standard. I've noticed that I'm not the only one who is annoyed by this. People are tired of being treated as animals who are attracted by shiny objects, or in this case celebrities.
