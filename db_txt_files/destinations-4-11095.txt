Wow, I am surprised how far down on the list Sanibel Island is. I remember visiting my grandparents during their stay in Florida and Sanibel Island was an exciting day trip. The beach itself was beautiful, clean and perfect for finding shells. The town is charming and unique..reasonable yet accomodating to tourists and locals alike. Unique shops and eateries make Sanibel a pleasant and relaxing day trip.
