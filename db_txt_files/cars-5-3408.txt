Just got our 5 speed 2001 RAV4 last Saturday, only 1 week after order (Was told may be up to 6 weeks). Apparently 5 speed is easiler to found than automatics. Solid construction, very quiet engine and versatile seats. Still try to adjust to the orange colour guages and the high driving position (Verse my old 91 Integra). Otherwise everything else is just like a car(may be better than some cars!) Louie
