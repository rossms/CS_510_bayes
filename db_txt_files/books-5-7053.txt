This trilogy is wonderful. As with all Robin Hobb books, I find each one hard to put down. It is equally as good as the Farseer trilogy. The characterisation is brilliant (especially for the women characters) and the originality used in the concept of a live-ship and in the other fantasy elements is enjoyable to read. Read the book Golden Fool (book two of the tawny man trilogy) and then re read the Liveship Traders trilogy to discover even more levels to the novels.
