I think he has the talent. He just hasn't found a good role that can let him really show how good he is. With his cute, kind-boy look, he's perfect for the good-man roles. It would be interesting to see him be the bad guy. I've seen him in To Gillian on her 34th Birthday, and think that he did a nice job there. If only he could find that one perfect role, he could be the next-best-thing in Hollywood.
