okay, i live in northern virginia, and generally when my friends and i wanna go to the beach, it's either ocean city or virginia beach. personally i don't see why virginia beach is so much higher up than ocean city. sure ocean city's a little more posh and expensive. but i'd have to say it's more fun and definitely more clean....
