Anyone who saw the Shanghai Noon know that Owen Wilson and Jackie Chan are pretty damn funny together. Shanghai Noon doesn't introduce much new stuff - but the interaction between Wilson and Chan combined with good fight scenes make this movie worth seeing in the theater. The pillow fight scene was absolutely hysterical, as are the bloopers. In terms of simple, mindless entertainment, you can't beat it.
