This one isn't for everyone. If you want your reading to be easy and undemanding, instant gratification, don't even try. This is a history text, beautifully written and full of amazing stories, the foundation of Middle Earth. I imagine it may have been closer to Tolkien's heart than his other books -- in it, he uncovers the depth, the richness of the histories of the Ages. If you're willing to invest a little effort, this is an absolute gem.
