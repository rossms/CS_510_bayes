A good film with some extreme points, but good ones nonetheless. Excellent performances by Gary Oldman and Joan Allen, and espescially Jeff Bridges, who brings a sense of comedy to the film. His speech to the Congress is very, very moving at the end. However, some of the scenes were shot very poorly, and the directing was a little sketchy, but overall, one of the most important American films of its time.
