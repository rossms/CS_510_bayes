Wanted to really like it but after having seen it once I couldn't say that I did. There was no pace to the movie and the scenes did not seem connected i.e. a poor, loose plot. It relied on its funnier predecessor to generate the majority of the jokes and therefore the film lacked real impact. My one caveat is that I have seen the first film a number of times and you do notice more of the gags so maybe it could be the same with this film but I wouldn't go mad for this in general.
