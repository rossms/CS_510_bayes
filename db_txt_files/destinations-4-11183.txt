I live in Minnesota and go to this waterpark every summer. They have many ride. Although it is crowded lines arent too bad unless you go on their newest ride. The price is pretty high 30 dollars, but thats what you expect at theme parks. The only con may be location because not all tourists want to go to the middle of Wisconsin and it can only be open during the summer.
