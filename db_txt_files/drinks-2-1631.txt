The only beer I've ever had where the drunker I get off of it, the less I want to drink of it. The taste builds up inside your mouth seemingly dropping a deuce on your taste buds and after a few of these, youre going to be ready to throw the rest of the case in the trash. I give it a 2nd star though because the bottles when EXTREMELY COLD arent terrible.
