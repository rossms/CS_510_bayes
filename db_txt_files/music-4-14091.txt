Widely considered Elton's best since his 70's heyday,and certainly his strongest offering for over a decade.I Want Love was a recent top 10 hit in Britain,but there are several stronger tracks;the haunting American Triangle,the elegiac This Train Don't Stop,the pulsating Wasteland,the tender Ballad of the Boy in the Red Shoes,and the lovely Original Sin.Although it's at least a couple of tracks away from classic status,it's undoubtedly a significant return to form(as well as in part to his roots),and should cheer most fans.
