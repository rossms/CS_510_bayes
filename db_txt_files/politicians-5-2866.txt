It's great to see a Republican who votes the way they want to, instead of bowing down to a dictator in Missippi or Oklahoma (not saying those states themselves are bad, but you know who I'm aluding to.) Why are some people here giving him one star? They seem to think Vermont citizens are so stupid that they vote for the party, not the person. That is idiotic.
