Carrie is a wonderful story and a great book. King's debut is well written and is quite a bit shorter than most King fans are used to. carrie follows a girl with telekenetic powers as she battles her high school life, her mother, and her own inner demons. A more human story than you might think at first glance. Although this story is a must-read, I'm don't think it belongs at the top of this list.
