The build quality is excellent. This car has the power, the control, the looks, and the attitude to command respect whether you're coming at it from an engineering or emotional point of view. The acceleration and handling are awesome. I now prefer to take the highways instead of the interstate on trips. My one regret is that in October of 2002 I bought the 2003 G35C 5AT (loaded). Should have gotten the 6MT... I have not found another car I would rather drive for less than $55K.
