These are yummy, but I wish the peanut butter were a bit smoother. It is too crumbly. Maybe it's difficult to insert good quality peanut butter inside there and have it stay well-preserved or something. I also wish the chocolate were better quality, and that the bottom wouldn't rub off onto those little muffin cups that they come in. It's like the chocolate decided to melt in a little circle in the exact same place every time. I like it when they come in a four-pack, because there are nothing but positives when you get an extra peanut butter cup.
