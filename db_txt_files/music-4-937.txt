This album is pretty good. It's got plenty of really good songs on it. Each song is different and they sound good which makes this an album you won't get sick of. Some of Live's best songs are on this album such as Lightning Crashes and I Alone . If you like rock music but you don't like music that is too heavy, this is a good album to have.
