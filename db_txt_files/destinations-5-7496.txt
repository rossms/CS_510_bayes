This tiny hill town near Orvieto is a piece of real Italy. It takes 5 minutes to walk from one end to the other and you'll hardly hear a word of English while you do it. Old and rustic, but not abandoned, Civita is its own attraction. It doesn't promote tourism, so it is the perfect place to go to get away from the mobs of other Italian destinations. The only way to get to it is to hike a 1/4 mile pedestrian-only bridge! Makes a great day-trip from Orvieto.
