I CANNOT EXPLAIN HOW MUCH I LOVE THEM! There is something so wonderful about biting into a Dunkin Donut. I can't even explain it. Even if the line is long, it's worth the wait, and when I don't want donuts, they have sandwiches, muffins, bagels, and coolattas for me to eat. Hands down the best doughnuts in the world.
