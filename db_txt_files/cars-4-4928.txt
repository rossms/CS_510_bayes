Good solid truck; I've put on 45,000 in 1 year, so the ride needs to be good, and it is. Great motor:I pull a trailer (trailer towing package) and it handles it well. Only trouble is front rotor/brakes, as I've had to machine them and replace 3 times now--seems to be a problem the service department can't correct. (Bigger rotors for towing-package?) Be careful with Goodyear RTS oem tires...they are useless when wet with that power and light back-end, I've had several on-ramp powerslides that scared the hell out of me! Getting new tires soon! Much more truck for the money than a Ranger or S-10.
