Blech! Whenever a house in my neighborhood was giving away Bit-o-Honey at halloween while I was trick-or-treating when I was little, we would warn the other kids not to go there. It was the much avoided candy (along with Mary Janes). While I like it better now than I did when I was little, it's still not my idea of enjoyable food. The taste is so-so, and I feel like it's going to rip out my teeth as I eat it. SamIAm said it best about slathering cement on your teeth. LOL! I'll stick to other candy, since there are much better kinds out there.
