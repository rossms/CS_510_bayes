I had an unfortunate experience. I ordered veal raviolis (I felt bad enough for ordering veal, and never have again) and in many of the raviolis there was a large amount of cartalige. Pretty gross. I haven't been back since. Although this is just one experience, the other times I visited Macaroni Grill, I have not been impressed by thier prices.
