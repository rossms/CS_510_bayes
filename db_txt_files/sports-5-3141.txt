How can any self-respecting, honest baseball fan give less than five stars to Willie Mays. He was the most complete player in the history of the game. No one, with the possible exception of Barry Bonds, has had Mays' combination of defense, speed, power, average and baserunning intelligence. Mays had one thing Bonds doesn't...a great throwing arm. There has never been a more complete package of talent in baseball. Willie lived, and still lives, baseball 24 hours a day. An army stint at the beginning of his prime kept him from breaking Ruth's record first.
