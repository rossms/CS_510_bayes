The video is funny, and Mark McGrath cracks me up. He has such an over-the-top personality. I am amazed, though, at the gratuitous strip-club scene. I can't believe they can show this stuff on MTV nowadays. Kids today! When I was growing up, in the 80's, Madonna, fully clothed singing Like a Virgin , caused such a ruckus......can't imagine what they would've thought about this back then.
