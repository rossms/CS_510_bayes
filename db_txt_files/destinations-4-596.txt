A very historic and lovely city. The poverty is of course disconcerting, but look beyond it and try and feel the atmosphere of 500 years of history and shadows of Islamic Spain. The old city should not be missed, but take the 'tour guides' at the musuems with a grain of salt. The best food is at restaurants run by expatriate Italians and Germans.
