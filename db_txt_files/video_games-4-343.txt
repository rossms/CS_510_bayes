This game is fun because of how many different things you can do in this game. First, you can fight on different planets or you can fight in space. Different scenes like stormtroopers and fighting in the forest are pretty cool scenes. The scene where you have to use your light saber to defend yourself is fun because you can really tear guys up. I like the fact that you can block laser guns with your light saber, just like in the movie. The story was cool too.
