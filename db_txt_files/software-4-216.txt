I'm currently using version 8.0.4 and it is much more stable than the last version, I like how it can give you the choice for only using the Mozilla rendering engine but you can have it switch to the IE engine on "trusted sites". The passcard feature is very useful for autofilling passwords and forms, I also like the new skin support though only a few are available at the moment. It's not perfect though, I've had a few crashes but it's rare. For novice users who want more security than IE offers it's great but for us more advanced users Firefox is still the best choice.
