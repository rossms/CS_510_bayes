By far the best beer that I have ever tasted... I've been drinking beers for over 25 years and I still have not found one that compairs to an Icy Cold Genny Creme! The taste is excellent the body and the finish is sweet and creamy... Nothing compairs to this fine beer. I want to know when I will be able to buy it in Washington State. I grew up drinking this beer and I miss it terribly...to this day.
