Took delivery of my Rav 4 NV 3 door 2wd this week..both me my wife luv it..the interior spec is better than I had ever dreamed..my only criticism is the hefty cost to upgrade the radio/cassette to a cd player.. 600!!...I thought the new VW Beetle was a good looking motor but the new Rav 3 door beats it..sorry can't add much at moment in the way of constructive criticism as only had the car 5 days.
