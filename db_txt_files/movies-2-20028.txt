I'm firmly against the entrenched Hollywood system, so I was geared from the beginning to like this film. Problem is, it's not any good. Nothing happens. Imagination is a great tool, true, but it needs something at least halfway substantial to ignite it, and this film ain't it. Basically it consists of supremely unpleasant people running around the woods lost, screaming at each other, collapsing in quaking terror over piles of twigs and sticks. The horror!
