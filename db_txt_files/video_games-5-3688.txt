Syphon Filter turned out to be really fun. There is a lot of blood and gore, but it's not that bad. The missions are very interesting, and there's never a game over. The voice acting isn't great, but who cares? My only complaint is that the 14th level (the catacombs in Ukraine) is extremely difficult and annoying. Other than that, SF is great. It's definately my favorite game in the adventure/shooter genre.
