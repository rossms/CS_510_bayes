The beer is wonderful on tap and pairs well with a steak or grilled foods. The color is a dark amber and the head is thick and leaves lacing on the glass the whole way down, it has a nice malty flavor balanced perfectly with a good hop bite. This may be a little too intense for Bud, Miller,Coors drinkers but give it a try. This is easily the best mass produced beer in America. This should be the representative for American beer around the world, not Budweiser.
