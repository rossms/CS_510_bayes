I rate this a 5 because Sony's sound quality is the best. I find that all their portable products are not good for hard and long use but it sounds beautiful. They need to improve the looks of the player because, to me, it looks tacky in a way. To invest in one is good but not for long term use. Sony is #1 and I think the discs will get better.
