John Carpenter has a sense of style in His Filmmaking,that's what this Movie lacks..style.Ethan Hawke is so thin & gaunt He looks sickly & has in His past few Films.The Suspense in the original was much more effective.I was disappointed.Lawrence Fishburne adds incredible presence in any Film He's in & His scenes are impressive.But..it's not enough.Even the action scenes needed more action.
