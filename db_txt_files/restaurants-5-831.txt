I love to eat here, I tried Quiznos and I thought they were too cheap on the toppings. All Quiznos has going for it is toasted buns, once Subway starts doing that Quiznos will be going out of business. My favorite sandwich is the spicy Italian, if you want a healthier sub skip the dressings and cheese.
