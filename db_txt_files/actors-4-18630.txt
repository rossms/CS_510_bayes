Ron Howard is a pretty good director in my humble opinion. Apollo 13 , Splash , Ransom , How the Grinch Stole Christmas , A Beautiful Mind and Night Shift were all great films. Most of his movies are light-hearted romances or comedies ( Splash ), but he has also proven that he has a nac for action ( Ransom ) and drama ( Apollo 13 , A Beautiful Mind ). A good director.
