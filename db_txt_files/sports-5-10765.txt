Beamer has taken a program with very little football tradition and turned it into a top 10 program. The state of Virginia is crazy about the Hokies, and Beamer manages to get most of the top recruits in the talented state of VA. He has been to big bowl games almost every year in the past decade and doesn't show any signs of the program slowing down.
