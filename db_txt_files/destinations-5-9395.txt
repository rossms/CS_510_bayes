Even better than the sunset on from the Charles Bridge is seeing the sunRISE. It's definitely worth the loss of sleep to wake up before dawn and get to the bridge. No one is around, it's quiet and peaceful, and the sunrise is amazing. The bridge is great during the day as well. When I was there, a little band of musicians aged 60 and up was playing Dixieland music. It gave things a neat feel. Definitely worth seeing.
