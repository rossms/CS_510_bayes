Now this makes no sense to see this beer this far down in the rankings to this site. Maybe people just haven't had the chance to try it yet. At any rate, this beer is right up there as one of the best. Especially the blonde. Robust, intense, and loads of licorice. A bold trappist beer from Belgium. You'll be lucky to find this great beer on tap, but the bottle version's pretty decent too. Can't drink these like Sewer's Light (i.e. high alcohol). A must try.
