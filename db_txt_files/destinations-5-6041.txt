Arizona is alot more than just deserts, heat and cactus. Northern Arizona has some of the most beautiful pine forests in the world. Not to mention the scenic beauty of the Grand Canyon. In Tucson, it is possible to go water skiing in the morning, and then less then 2 hours later, being schushing down the the slopes. Too bad we have the worst pro football team in the NFL. But, our Diamondbacks and Suns almost make up for them.
