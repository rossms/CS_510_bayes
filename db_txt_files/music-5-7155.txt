The song and video went together perfectly. 'teen spirit was full of this raw energy and power, a party song and the video was shot in a dark erotic gym with grunge cheerleaders, (cobain's touch), and had a pulsating rythm to it. the lighting was brilliant on the band, escpecially kurt and the slow motion sequences were another brilliant touch. every gets together and goes nuts, much like the chaos of the song. great video.
