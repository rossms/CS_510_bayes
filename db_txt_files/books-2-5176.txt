I have read many comments about this book being the best book that an individual has ever read. I dare say that I have never heard of any other SINGLE book which has as many fans who claim it to be the (singular) greatest book that they have ever read. It is surprisingly unengaging for such a build-up. I didn't really get into it. Maybe I gave up too soon. Sorry if I did, but I don't regret it.
