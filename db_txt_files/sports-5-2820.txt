Just look at the yearly pre-season expert picks. The Giants are almost never picked to do anything...Baker usually gets them there anyway. Players love and respect him very much. He gets the most out of every single player on his roster. I don't think anyone is better at knowing how to use his reserve players. It's just a shame that the owners have sent him into 2001 with a weaker team. To be objective. He did make some big mistakes in games 2 5 of the Mets series in 2000.
