Yield is an album that goes to show that true talented musicians can take their music in any direction, even experimental (ie hidden track, Push Me Pull Me, almost a spoken word track), and still rule. Each band member contributes at least a song, and plays with an understated power and ability that isn't seen too often in modern rock.
