I've got a 27 inch TV with PIP and the picture is pretty good. My one complaint is that I wish I could switch from the TV speakers to my stereo speakers through the set-up menu. Instead, if I have the TV hooked up to my stereo and want to use the stereo speakers, I need to press a button on the back of the TV. Some cool features include 4 letter channel IDs, auto off and auto on, and a special on switch which you can program to turn the TV and go directly to a specific channel.
