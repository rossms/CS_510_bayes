Most definitely the best medical school in the south. First, you have the largest medical school in the NATION. Mix in equal parts of a great didactic program, a fantastic diversity of rotations, and an awesome curriculum that lets you get into rotations early and you have the prescription for a great education. On top of all of that, Houston has something for everyone.
