Avis is so easy to do business with. I've used them four times while making trips back to N.D. The reservation process, pick-up and drop-off were all extremely easy. They're also the cheapest out of all the rental car companies I checked with. At one point I needed to add a driver to be covered under the rental agreement, I called and they did this in about two minutes, with no hassles. The workers are also very friendly. They helped me install my car seat for my infant and put my luggage in the car. I'll definitley use them in the future!
