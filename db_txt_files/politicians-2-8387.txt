Goodbye Ron. Ron was an excellent orator and I really do believe that deep down he was a good man. Which is more than I can say about Wubya. I think he is given way too much credit for our booming economy of the 90's. Reagan made plenty of mistakes in his two terms as president. He dropped the ball on the whole aids epidemic, he sold arms to Iran, he completely shamed the mental health field by his stance on those with mental illness. Ironic how someone who showed so little support for those with a mental illness; ended up with a mental illness. Anyway, rest in peace Ronnie.
