I'm from Rochester, New York, just accross the lake from Toronto. Now that they have the fast ferry, its awsome to be able to go to toronto every weekend. It is a great city with tons of culture and plenty to do. And were i live, rochester, is very affordable, so i can spend plenty of time in toronto without having to pay tons of money because i will admit, it is a pretty expensive city. the people are great too!
