I became a vegetarian 2 years ago, and one of the hardest things for me to give up was Egg McMuffins. I craved them so bad that one day I went in and asked if I could have them without the meat. (I am lacto-ovo, so eat egg and cheese) I thought they would treat me weird or say no, but I have done this at least 10 times now, and have never had a problem. Of course, I pay the same price as the regular ones. But being able to have my Egg Mc Muffins once in a while is worth it! I love to accompany them with McDonald's orange juice---its great juice and I like that its in softdrink cups rather than the cartons.
