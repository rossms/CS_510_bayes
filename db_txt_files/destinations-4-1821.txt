There's a lot of good stuff and a lot of bad stuff about this country of ours. Obviously there are endless possibilties here and the most freedom out of any country in the world. However, we do sport one of the highest crime rates in the world. Many people wonder why this is. I think it's because of the huge gap between the rich and poor. Also, the media in the states straight up sucks.
