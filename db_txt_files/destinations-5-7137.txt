Having been to Amsterdam three times in the past year, I must say that it's one of the most laid back places on earth. It's a city that continues to enchant me with a lifestyle that is appealing and people that are friendly. I was able to travel outside of Amsterdam to Hoorne and Volendam and found both equally delightful. It's a quality of life that is attractive and like it use to be here in the states, decades ago. I could live there.
