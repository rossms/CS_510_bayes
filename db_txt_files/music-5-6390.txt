Those two guys who gave Brutal Planet 1 star are total idiots and don't realize how brilliant this man is! I'm only 13 and I'm one of the biggest Alice Cooper fans alive thanks to Brutal Planet. I originally liked Weird Al Yankovic but when I got this album it was good-bye Al and Hello Alice! The song and the video for Gimme is one of the best I've seen in years. Sanctuary, Blow Me A Kiss and Wicked Young Man are good songs too. Don't listen to those punks and go out and buy Alice Cooper's Brutal Planet!
