There is a certain backlash against Gibson that I don't understand. No, he's not great but his diverse body of work is rather underrated. From the car-wreck cowboy role Mad Max he goes to the ultimate 80's cop movie Lethal Weapon. How about The Bounty? He isn't a bad director. . . The Man without a Face might be the best film you've never heard of. Braveheart wasn't perfect but a damn good film. He cares about his projects and manages to do different things. (He wasn't a great Hamlet but at least he tried.) If only Hollywood dopes had his level of imagination.
