I don't live far from here. Less than a hour flight. There are all kinds of fun festivals here, like Caribana in the summer. Who are you kidding ? I don't see New York as any more 'sophisticated'. Did you know eraser-head Donald 'You're Fired' Trump lives in New York ? Toronto is very under-rated here in the USA. Toronto has a great night-life too.
