Maybe a little spendy,..... But that $$ goes into the quality.... incredible refinement., Handling is top notch,.... Anyone can make a high HP engine, but to make one that handles like this is rare,... HP isnt everything... If it was, I would buy a cheap Camaro or Stang,......This is a well rounded sports car,.. Anyone who has truly drove this car will not be dissapointed. You can turn this machine around in your garage..But please!!!!! $88,000 ..... I dont think so,.....
