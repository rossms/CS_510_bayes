Joyride reminded me of the Hitcher from the 80s.Two brothers on their way home impersonate a woman on the cb and cause a psycho to start piling up bodies as he chases our heroes and their girlfriend.Very well done by some well known actors.This is a good date flick if you want your girl grabbing you at the suspenseful parts.
