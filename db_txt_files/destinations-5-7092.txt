Dublin is one of my favorite destinations. Many consider it the most exciting city in Europe, and I don't think they're far off. I particularly like the Temple Bar area, which has great accomodations from quite reasonable tourist hotel/guesthouses to the lovely Oliver St. John Gogarty. O'Connell Street is the widest street in Europe, and certainly one of the most entertaining. And there's always the Guinness Brewery at St. James Gate. Don't miss it!
