Among the light cigarettes I've smoked, the best one has been Merit (I mean those orange Merits). When you are tired, a light Merit can help you a lot. It is not so strange and is enough to relax you, nothing more. I like to swallow the smoke and keep it inside for a few seconds. This way it effects me better. I am happy with the quality of tobacco of Merit.
