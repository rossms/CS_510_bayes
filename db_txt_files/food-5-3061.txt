Wow, Mystic Mints are truly delectable! Basically, they're mint-flavored Oreo cookies dipped in a dark chocolate coating. The mint flavor is not overpowering, and the chocolate cookie layer is crisp and tasty. The outer coating of chocolate is just thick enough, and it has a rich, smooth taste. Mystic Mints are so satisfying, I don't feel compelled to eat more than one at a sitting. If you like the combination of chocolate and mint, you'll love these cookies- guaranteed.
