 X doesn't sound anything like Hysteria Pyromania or Euphoria . There are no songs like Sugar Photograph or Promises . Almost all of the songs have something to do with love. What X does have is about 11 of 13 good songs. Most of them are very good songs. Now Everyday Long Long Way To Go Torn To Shreds and Scar and the best of them. Looking for a good cd to buy....go get X .
