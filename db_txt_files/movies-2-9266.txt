it has some moments. homer simpson once said: i thought when marge became a cop, it would be fun and exciting, like that movie, you know, 'spaceballs'. but instead it's been painful and disturbing, like that movie, you know, 'police academy'. so, compared to police academy , this is painful and disturbing? yeah. wake up; mel brooks used to be funny, yeah, but somebody out there must respect him enough to tell the guy that his later work, like this, is just plain offal.
