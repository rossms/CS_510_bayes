I am actually an employee there. As such, I can tell you we do have a very dedicated staff and a very fun working environment. And yes.. stormrunner is GREAT :). It goes 0-72 in 2 seconds off the launch and is the first and only hydraulicly launched steel coaster with inversions in the COUNTRY. Its also fun to work at, seeing all the peoples expressions. Just stopping by :). If anyone has any questions, feel free to e-mail me at poeticsilences@hotmail.com
