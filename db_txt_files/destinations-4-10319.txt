A great cigarette. The only reason to get these is fot the unfiltered kind. The filters are good too but not really that much different from your basic cigarette. Getting back to the non-filters, they are really strong, but really good. Just a heads up, they'll knock you on your ass if you're not careful. Also, another problem is that you sometimes get tobacco in your mouth when smoking these which is very unpleaseant.
