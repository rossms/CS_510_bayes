Limp Bizkit has become popular ever since their appearance on MTV's Spring Break. I liked this album because it contains songs like Nookie and All N2gether Now. It has a good mix of rock and rap (like when it features Method Man of the Wu-Tang Clan). It shows the diversity of the band and the different kinds of songs they are capable of doing.
