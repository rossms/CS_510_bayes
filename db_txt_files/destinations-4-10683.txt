i started on some marlboro menthol lights and wasn't too into it. a friend of mine got me onto these. they're intense and u could really feel them. sometimes they're so strong i can feel it burning my throat. i've gotten some kinda sore throat infection thing prob from them. looking for something with the same buzz but without the menthols.
