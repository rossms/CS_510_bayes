This is an extremely delicious drink! Like other flavors of Tazo's Juiced Teas, it's basically a fruit juice and doesn't bear much resemblance to tea. But, in addition to the plum, pomegranate and sugar, it does also contain green tea. Its 160 calories per 14 ounce bottle put it slightly below the level of soda and fruit juices.
