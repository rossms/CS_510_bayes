Granted, Cheerwine is not available everywhere (mostly in the Southeast I believe); however, it runs circles around its competitors like cherry coke, etc. This soft drink is easily a North Carolina institution (made in Salisbury if memory serves), and one must at least try Cheerwine when traveling within or through the state. Diet Cheerwine is good too as it appears that cherry flavor can be reproduced in a lite form easier than other flavored soft drinks.
