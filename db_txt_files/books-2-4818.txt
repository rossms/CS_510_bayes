When did this become literature? Moby Dick was the most boring book I have ever read. Pathetic. I don't remember which friend of mine recommended it to me, bu it's time for them to own up so that I can yell at them. When I started to read about the ship's first encounter with Moby Dick, my thoughts exactly were, Yeah? So? . I have hated everything I have ever read that was by Herman Melville, so do y'all think it's time for me to stop torturing myself? I do. Take care, everyone.
