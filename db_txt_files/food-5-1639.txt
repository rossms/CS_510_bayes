Life Savers and Jolly Rancher are pretty much the superlatives when it comes to hard candy (along with Wacky Wafers, Bottlecaps and Runts of course). Mmmm: Life Savers fancy fruits and tropical fruits...or remeber those swirls suckers?...or that jingle Life Savers: a part of living?...or that xmas book?...Life Savers are like an American institution or something and some pretty good hard candy if a little small: the size is more like a formal mint than an informal candy.
