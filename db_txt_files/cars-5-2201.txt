I have owned every Z car made from a 1971 240Z to a 1974 260Z to a 1978 280Z to a 1981 280ZX to a 1985 300ZX Turbo to a 1990 300ZX. They are absolutely the best cars I have ever owned. My present 300ZX is a joy to drive and I can do a lot of the work to it myself in terms of maintenance and performance mods. THEY ARE GREAT CARS!!!!
