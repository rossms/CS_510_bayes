I would give Wendy's an average of a four because they do have a pretty good sized menu for a fast food restaurant. Although I think their burgers are okay I prefer some of the other food items Wendy's has. they offer quite a few salads, {I like the taco salad} Their chili is pretty good, I like their chicken sandwhiches. they also offer a 99cent menu for those on a budget. I like their frosties too.
