I've never really enjoyed Wendy's. I've only been there a few times, all at different locations, with the same bad service. The burgers are good, no doubt, but they are always extremely messy. I like the meat, but I do noit like how they are square. They taste the same to Burger King's. The service is always bad to OK, one time the idiot tried making us pay 3 times of what we owed. I'm glad there's lots of Burger Kings around here.
