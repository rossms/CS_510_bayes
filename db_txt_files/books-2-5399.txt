Ugh, I don't know why, but I did not enjoy this book at all. I guess I have to give Guterson credit for his imagery and historical background..but for whatever reason, I found myself skipping over his long winded descriptions to get to the point. I was so uninterested that I skipped to the end to see what happened, and even then I didn't care.
