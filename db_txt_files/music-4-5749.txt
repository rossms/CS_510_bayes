Definitely JP's most commercial and accessible album, from which its biggest singles hits came 'Breaking the law' and 'Living after midnight'. Other great tracks include the breakneck fast 'Rapid fire' and 'Metal gods'. However, a couple of fillers here e.g. 'Grinder' dont quite put this on a par with their best stuff e.g. 'Stained class', 'Painkiller' and 'Screaming for vengeance. Still, overall it kicks arse.
