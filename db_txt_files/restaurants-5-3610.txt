I had forgotten about this treasure of a pizza chain until a couple months ago when a friend of mine said, 'Let's get Little Caesar's!' I was so caught off gaurd, I just all giddy thinking about it. My mom used to get this pizza for the whole family when they had the 'Pizza Pizza' deal years and years ago. I haven't had it since then. Needless to say, we got the pizza and it was so good. The crust is light. It is so cheap and are always offering good deals. They also have these great bread sticks that you can order and dip in marinara sauce. It is so good.
