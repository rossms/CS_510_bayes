This action packed Sci-fi stuff is not my favorite movie genre, but I was compelled to see it due to the much-ballyhooed special effects and makeup. THAT should have been the first white flag. Yes, they really were great. It was the plot and story that lacked depth and much of the time seemed very cartoon-like. My biggest gripe was lack of any real character development. So, to sum up, this movie is really big on action, is a holiday for special effects buffs but easily managed not to burden its audience with interesting, deep or complicated dialogue. Overall - just a very expensive, flashy piece of fluff.
