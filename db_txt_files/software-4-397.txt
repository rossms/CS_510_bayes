Windows 98 is a good operating system. It seems to be easier to manipulate than the newer Windows. Also, it has great support for MS-DOS programs. You can run about any, if not any, MS-DOS program with this operating system. Furthermore, with Win98 SE, you can still run a lot of the newer games. With win98 SE, you get to play new games, as well as some old classics. I'm only giving Win98 4 stars because it has a higher tendency to crash than Win XP, and, sadly, it is becoming outdated.
