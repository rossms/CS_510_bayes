The thing that really ticks me off is all of these people who now say I've always liked Tampa Bay . Yeah, right! I spent 12 years in the Navy, knew of only four other Bucs fans, and saw one other person walking down a street in Japan with a Bucco Bruce jacket. For those who challenge my knowledge of Bucs history are soundly put in their place. Besides that, I'm enjoying the one thing that I thought would never happen to this franchise: A World Championship!!!!
