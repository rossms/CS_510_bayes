I had to read the book the Heart of Darkness which this movie was taken from for a college course I took. I love to read but I found the movie as boring as I found the book. Maybe I missed something, it's suppose to be a classic by Joseph Conrad but I don't think I could sit through either the book OR the movie again to see if I was wrong.
