It's truly amazing this way Ichiro has come in and just dominated. Bobby Valentine said a few years ago that Ichiro was not only the best position player in Japan, but that he was in the top five players in the world. Ichiro has proved Valentine correct this year. He seems to get on base two or three times per game, is an incredibly disruptive force on the bases, and makes great plays in the outfield. He almost certainly will start in the MLB All-star game next month and is making all of Seattle forget A-Rod and Junior.
