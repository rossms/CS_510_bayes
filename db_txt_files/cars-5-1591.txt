I absolutely love my Golf. I have zero complaints about it. I've taken it back and forth across the country, driven thousands of miles at a stretch, through all kinds of weather and it just keeps on going. Great in the snow, strong stable front wheel drive gets me out of just about anything. Dollar for dollar I'd be hard pressed to find a better deal. Would I buy one again? In a heartbeat!
