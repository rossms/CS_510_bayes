I think his situation is similar to A-Rod of MLB. One of the best players in the league, solid top 5, but he took the $$$, which majority of us would, and now plays on an average team at best. I think the only way he elavates his status is by taking a pay-cut so the T-Wolves can bring in another star, either that or he needs to get out of Minnesota.
