Italy is a great country to visit, with delicious food, wonderful sights, loads of culture and friendly, sociable people. I live in Italy, though, and I must say it is not that great to live here. The services are usually bad and the country itself(especially down south)is starting to fall to pieces. Still, Italy remains a very romantic and fun place to visit, with many things to offer.
