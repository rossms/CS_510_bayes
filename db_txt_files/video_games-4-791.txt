I still have my Clue game board from over thirty years ago.A fun who done it game.The player has to guess which person done it, with what, and what room.Once the player figures out the answer they must still get to the room they think it happened in.I can remember how anxious we got when you could see others knew who done and trying to get to that room first. Each player has cards dealt to them and must show a card on when requested.this game is still around today for this generations kids to play with.
