I just had the most pleasant experience with Myshoestore.com. I bought a pair of Dansko Professional clogs, for working long nursing hours on my feet. I placed my order with a very friendly customer service representative, got an amazingly low price, plus a 15% discount, and they were on my doorstep before I even knew it! Great store, 5 stars.
