This girl has it going on. She expresses herself incredibly well, using her music as an outlet. Each track is unique, although they share the same general idea. I think every woman should own this album. Men should definitely hear it, but considering she's anti-men, I don't know how they'd react. All I can say is that my boyfriend doesn't care for her.
