I don't know what those other guys are smoking But Mac OS and Mac OS X are two differant OS's Mac OS is outdated crap, while Mac OS X is modern and stylish. And to all the people who say it's the best OS ever, just remember, it would still be crap if Apple didn't use FreeBSD and actually made their own OS, every new release of Mac OS X is basicly a reworked version of a new FreeBSD release with Aqua and their OpenGL component (forgot it's name) thrown on top.
