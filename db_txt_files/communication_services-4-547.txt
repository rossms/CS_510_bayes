I love Nextel phones. The I1000plus is great. Two-way radio is instantaneous and has a hundred mile diameter, making it possible to talk to a whole team of employees or friends scattered across town. Nextel customer reps are friendly and even go out of their way to call me when a new promotion hits the floor.
