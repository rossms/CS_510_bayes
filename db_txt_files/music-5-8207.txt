hey, i'm not a big rap fan, but i love snoop. i don't really like dre that much. he's great when he does songs with other people, but as for his solo stuff.... well..i'm getting off topic. this video is well, just a great video. this video suits the song very well, its a kindof a chill video mixed with a chill song. its a great way to introduce snoop to the rap world. a definate classic, one of the better rap videos ive seen.
