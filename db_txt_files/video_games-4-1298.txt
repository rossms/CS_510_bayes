Betting on sports is a game of skill. The challenge is to gather and analyze as much information about the game you want to bet on. Then you weigh all your options and make your choice. I bet mostly during football season. During football, bookmakers bring out their football promos such as sign-up / reload bonus and free contests. This season Im planning to add SPORTSBETTING.COM to my list. They have a great free contest called $500,000 Gridiron Pickem where you could win $500,000 in cash.
