You people are all ignorant hillbillies. Husky is made by United States Smokeless Tobacco, the same company that makes Copenhagen, Skoal, etc. The tobacco in the cans of Husky is the same tobacco which makes it into the Skoal and Copenhagen cans. Take a tour of the factory, you will see what I am talking about. All those people who can tell a difference need to go get their heads examined. Its all psychological.
