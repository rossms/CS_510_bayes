it was unbelievable how terrible this movie was. this movie might have been good if i were a twelve year old who fantasised about jenifer love hewitt and had never seen a movie in my life.it was as about as suspensful as my grandmother eating mashed potatoes through a straw.and whats the deal with the story? what, did they not have a plot so they twisted what ever story they had enough so that it makes no sense and it seems like your fault for not getting it? i gave it two stars because the movie is a great example of how not to make a horror movie.
