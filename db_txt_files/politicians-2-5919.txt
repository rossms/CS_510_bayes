I consider myself a fiscal conservative so I automatically give Byrd a low rating. He's known as king of pork-barrel spending and that's in a poverty stricken state of WV. He's also known as a former high ranking member of the KKK and has voted against the Civil Rights act in 1964. Evidently he still can't shake off his racist past, as just a few years ago in a Fox interview Byrd used the N-word twice. Byrd has gotten off easy, unlike Trent Lott, because he is a DEMOCRAT. I give him an extra star because at least he is against the war.
