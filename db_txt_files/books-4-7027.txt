I enjoyed this book more than Ender's Game, which is the first book in the Ender series. I really like the concept of 'speaking for the dead' as a way of remembering some one's life. This is the best book in the Ender series, the last two of the original series are readable, but did not excite me and kind of tore the whole series down.
