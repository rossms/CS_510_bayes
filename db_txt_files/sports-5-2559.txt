Roger Clemens, Andy pettite, Carlos Beltran at the deadline, and one hell of a playoff push last year. Last time I checked the Mets had over paid for Beltran just to get him, Who's faults that. I would love to see my team make a playoff push year after year like Houston has. He deserves some credit for the effort of bringing in key players and the talent poole that Houston has produced some great pitching prospects. Roy Oswalt ring any bells.
