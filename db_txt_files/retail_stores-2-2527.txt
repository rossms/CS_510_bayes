i would be embarssed if i was the manager of that store. every employee (lehigh acres fl) looks so dirty and i mean DIRTY! from clothing that does not fit, to greasy hair and depressed faces. the whole store needs help. i seriousley would never buy anything from there that i knew was packaged up by an employee. the only time i ever consider going there is when there is no other option. this is very sad to me because i have been in other winn dixie stores (newer ones) and it is a totally different experience
