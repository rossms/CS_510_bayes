I can totally understand why someone wouldn't like a 3 Musketeers. I, for some reason, am a freak and love them. I am also a picker. As gross as it is, I have a habit of picking at my food and especially something like a candy bar. I eat the chocolate covering of the bar, and then pick at the nugget middle and suck little bits of it. It sounds gross, it is pretty gross but it tastes good.
