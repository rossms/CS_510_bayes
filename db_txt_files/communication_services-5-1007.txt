I realize that Verizon wireless has bought out many companies, such as Airtouch and GTE, but they are great! I have had no problems whatsoever with my paging service or billing. I do think that they are advertising way too much though. Every commercial break they show two different commercials for Verizon wireless and to me, that's a bit much. But the service is awesome.
