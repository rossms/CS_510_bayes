While I can appreciate a good brew, I am also a fan of sub-par beer. This is subpar beer of the best kind. A little too watery and everything. One of the biggest swindles I've ever seen was ordering six Tecate for me and my friends in an NYC restaurant. The price wound up being $30 ($5/each) as they handed me six cans of cheap Mexican beer. That $30 probably could have bought a year's worth of clothes, school supplies, etc. for some kid in Mexico. Oh well, it was a good night and good beer.
