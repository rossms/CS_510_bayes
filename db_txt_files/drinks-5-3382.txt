My favorite one from Jamba, but Blenders In The Grass brand of smoothies taste so much better! Blenders is only found in Santa Barbara County, CA., in-case you were wondering. Jamba's other flavors have too many ingredients in them that takes away from the featured flavor. I hate bannana in my smoothies, and it seems Jamba nearly puts bannana in all of them. Even though you can eliminate certain items... I'm afraid to try them, since I found one I really like.
