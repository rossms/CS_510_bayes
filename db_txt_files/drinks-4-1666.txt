I've changed my tune on this beer completely. I used to think that it was the most watery, crappy beer in the land. Now, I realize that every situation has its appropriate beer. Coors Light is all about the outdoors, the picnic where you're going to be drinking steadily over a long period of time, where you don't want to get too dehydrated but you don't want to be sipping water. Coors Light rocks!
