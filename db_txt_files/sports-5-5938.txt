J.J. Redick is the best player in the country right now! Anyone who doesn't like him is just goddamn jealous because whatever team you like doesn't have him on their team! You can talk trash about him all you want but that wont make him less of a player it will only fuel him to get better so your really doing him a favor talking trash about him!
