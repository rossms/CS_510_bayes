The candy lolly pop in blow pops is so gross. The gum on the inside, if you want to call it gum becomes a slimy blob with grains of sugar and then right when all the grains blend in the flavor is all gone. I chose not to blow these pops, I mean, I wouldn't say no if someone offered, but I would chose a normal lollypop over a blow pop.
