If you haven't read the book, for goodness sakes don't go by the movie! I can't believe people are rating things they haven't even read!!! This book is extremely thought provoking and exists in a well-thought out world. Even if you don't agree with any of the ideas in the book, you'll be given plenty of mind-food. The movie really missed the point.
