I have tasted many tequilas, and I am a tequila aficionado I like the traditionals such as Herradura. Casa Noble is more of a boutique tequila but with innovations such as the triple distilled and French oak barrels, from the region of Tequila with characteristics of citrus, herbs and spices. I would say Casa Noble is among the best tequilas made.
