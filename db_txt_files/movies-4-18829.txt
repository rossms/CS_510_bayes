The film was a little too dark in its cinematography. I got the point, but I don't really enjoy the look, especially when you're watching a DVD, and you're not in a theater. It had an ingenious plot: 12 Monkeys meets Dawn of the Dead. I'm glad the message (We were killing each other before; we're killing each other now -- what's the difference?) was naive and thankfully short and sweet. But the mayhem that followed was fabulous! If he had used more light, I would have given it a 5.
