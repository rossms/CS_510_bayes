Plain and simple: An OUTSTANDING car at an OUTSTANDING value; this car shows up overpriced Ferrari's and Porsche's all day long with its 450hp V10. A superb handler as well as a muscle car. Just look at it: it's style just can't be beat! Nothing has the same mix of sexy curves and pissed off aggression. In my opinion, the best factory American car ever made. The mixing of classic European sports car with American muscle.
