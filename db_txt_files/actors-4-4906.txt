Matthew McConaughey is one of those actors that are hard to categorize. His films stretch the genres as do his performances. He doesn't have a clear flair for any sort of style of movie i.e. drama or comedy. I rather like that about him though. An all-around good actor, he has a very charming persona that gives him incredible screen presence. For me, I prefer him in romantic comedies where he shows off an easy sense of humor and definite charisma. Although as a side note, I'd like to know who can ever figure out the spelling of his last name?
