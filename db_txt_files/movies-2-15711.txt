I remember liking this when I saw it as a kid, but on another more recent viewing, I found it pretty lackluster. Nevertheless, if its at all accurate about what it was like reporting on politics at the Post in 1973/4, its pretty amazing to see how unsophisticated the media and Washington were at the time. We've become so cynical so fast!
