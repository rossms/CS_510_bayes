R.eading these reviews it is obvious there are more problems with drivers than with the trucks . Had a Ford 1/2 ton. Had a Chev 3/4 crew cab long box. Haul anything but 6mpg. Had a 75 Power wagon crew cab , hauled anything anywhere. 15mpg. Wore it out and got an 86 w150 , 16mpg. Wore it out. Still have a 75 Dodge motor home (250000 + miles ) Just bought a 97 1500/ 18mpg. Do you get the picture ?
