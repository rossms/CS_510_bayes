As far as I'm concerned, Domino's is tops when it comes to pizza. Their pizza sauce is magnificent and their crust is moist and chewy. Plus, Domino's always heaps on the toppings in generous portions unlike some of it's competitors. My only complaint is that Domino's pizza sizes are rather small, they don't even offer extra large or party size pizzas!
