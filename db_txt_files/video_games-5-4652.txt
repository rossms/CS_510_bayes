Another masterpiece from the best video game designer of all time, Shigeru Miyamoto. Debuing not only Donkey Kong (as a villain!), but also the infamous superstar plumber Mario, this game as a true classic. Mario must rescue the princess (Sounds familiar?) from the clutches of Donkey Kong while hopping over barrells and burning oil cans! True Nintendo magic.
