Vinny was a great college QB. He put up some pretty unbelievable numbers at Miami and still holds numerous passing record, an amazing accomplishment given the great success of some of their QBs. However, whenever I think of Testaverde as the Miami QB, I think of his interceptions against Penn State which cost the Hurricanes the national championship.
