I gave Mandy a 4 because she has one really good song. The others are alright and probably would've done well if they were released. I'm disappointed that she didn't try harder with her album (promoting) because it makes her look more like a packaged deal where the industry is obviously just trying to see if they can make money off her, then pulled her out. In other words, it makes her seem not genuine artistically. I also think she would have a good voice if she worked to develop it more. But only if she's concerned with her talent artistically, which it doesn't seem she is.
