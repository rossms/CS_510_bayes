mazda made this car look really different and it doesnt work that well. they should have gone for a leaner look imo. what does work, is everything else. the powerful new rotory engine won International Engine of the Year. thats quite impressive. it has amazing performance thanks to the placement of the small rotary engine. its weight is 50/50. it handles very well. the whole four door thing is interesting. the interior is nice and comfortable.
