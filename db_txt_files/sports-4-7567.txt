Karl Malone, in my opinion is one of the best. I would place him among Magic and Bird, as impact to a game, only in his behalf, having J.Stockton as a compliment. Magic had Worthy, Scott, Jabbar, and Cooper. Bird had McKale, Ainge, Parish, and Johnson. The only thing I don't like about Malone is his character. If I could rate him a 4.5, rating Bird and Magic just 4, and Jordan 5, I would. But, I had to round down because of Jordan, the greatest player of all time.
