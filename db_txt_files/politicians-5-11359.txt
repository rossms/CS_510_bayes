I think Mrs. Clinton would be a good president. She is a smart person and has experienced the White House first-hand already. She is well spoken and doing a good job as a Senator. UPDATE: The attitude of *Few presidents are powerful or smart enough to really damage America. I am not willing to take the chance with her.* is not that attitude I have for my leaders.
