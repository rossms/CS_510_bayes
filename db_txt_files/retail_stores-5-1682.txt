I'm not sure what Kmart stores these negative reports are referring to, but my Kmart is nothing like that! I still love Kmart as a discount shopping store, the employees are very friendly and helpful, remember me from visit to visit, AND their snack bar is one of the only department or discount store snack bars left where you can still get something besides hotdogs and nachos...Kudos KMART!!!
