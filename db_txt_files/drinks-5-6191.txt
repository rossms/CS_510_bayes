I love Diet Pepsi, one because I don't drink coffee so there is caffeine in soda and it helps. It's also sugar free and I am diabetic so I can't have too much sugar. Unlike Diet Coke it is very smooth and light, not as dry as Diet Coke. You can get it almost everywhere. Not too expensive if you know where to get it. Very refreshing when it's cold. Can recycle.
