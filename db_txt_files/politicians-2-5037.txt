Harvard prick. . .hopefully this past election will give him a dose of humility. Gore thinks he's better than you- Bush KNOWS he's better than you. Gore scares off just enough voters with his air of superiority. He lacks Clinton's charisma but lots of people in DC are in the same category. And how can you respect a politician who loses in his own state while running for president?
