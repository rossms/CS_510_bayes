I too think Lane Bryant is overpriced, but I don't think their clothing is too revealing. As a matter of fact I feel their clothes are too frumpy, maybe because I am on the smaller end of the size scale to which they cater. Their spring line is frumpy and frilly and I think it makes a larger woman look bigger than she really is.
