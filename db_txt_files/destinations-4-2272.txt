WHOA! I've been stopping in Dubai for the last 10 years and it's really changing! A GREAT time can be had by anyone here if you barely put your mind to it. Some of the neatest hotels and best service I have seen in the world, awsome beaches and luxuries are ALL OVER! The downtown area is pretty crowded and pretty nasty, but the gold souk offers great prices on gold jewelry. Huge, modern malls and affordable resorts along the beach make winter seem like summer. Had lot's of fun at the Wild Wadi water park!
