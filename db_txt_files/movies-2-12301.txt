Not even Dan Akroyd and the late John Candy could rescue 'Nothing But Trouble' from its relative disgrace as a feature film. The egomaniac Chevy Chase and the formerly-entertaining (now wannabe Mrs. Ashton Kutcher) Demi Moore virtually ruined their careers with this demented movie. But in everyone's defense, Martin Lawrence's 'Black Knight' and the film embarrasment of all-time, 'The Jerky Boys Movie' are still far worse than this bad movie. Compared to those movies, it has some okay qualities (albeit very few).
