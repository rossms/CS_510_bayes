I don't care a lick about Jazz, but I still found myself absorbed in episodes of Burns' recent documentary series on PBS. His greatest work, of course, remains his Civil War set of 1991 or so. I don't know if he was the genius that matched the beautiful melody of Ashokan Farewell with the reading of an achingly thoughtful love letter from soldier Sullivan Ballou to his wife days before he died at the Battle of Bull Run (end of episode one) -- but whoever decided to pair those two together came up with one of the most touching moments I've ever witnessed in film.
