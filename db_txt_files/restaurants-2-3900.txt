It's edible, but certainly not great. The sauce is a little too sweet for my liking, and the cheese doesn't have that distinct bite or stretch of a good Mozzarella. Although the pizzas are made fresh, they seem to have an 'artificial' or 'premade' taste. I'll eat the stuff if it's offered, but I don't order from them. The main appeal here is that it's pretty much cheaper than any other pizzaria.
