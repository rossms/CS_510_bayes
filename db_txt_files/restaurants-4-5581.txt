If I was 10, I'd give this a 1. Because of what my mom told me about it. But on my way to Alabama me, my brother and my dad stopped at one and wow. I loved it. And it was pretty nice inside. Good service, good food. And Ignatius-J-Reilly is right. They do have freindly staff and another reason this is a good restaraunt is that it was a diner type of restaraunt and it was in front of I-75 in Ohio. This may be gross to all you people that don't like Denny's, WELL YOU'RE WRONG!!!
