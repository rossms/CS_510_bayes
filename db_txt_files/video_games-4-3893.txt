The game concept of cops and robbers is a good idea. The two player option makes this game more exciting. The graphics are good, but they could be a lot better compared to other racing games. There should be more choices of cop cars to choose from, and more choices of cars to be able to drive. The simulation mode, (money mode) keeps the user coming back to play more.
