A magnificent lady and a true freedom fighter. She and her powerful sisters from the Congressional Black Congress stood as a beacon of light in the darkness as the U.S. Senate propped up an African-American legislator to certify the disenfranchisement of Florida's, and the United States of America's electorate. Shame on each and every cowardly Democratic Senator, including liberals like my own state's Kennedy and Kerry, who conspired to stifle the last honorable voice of dissent to the Republican coup d' tat.
