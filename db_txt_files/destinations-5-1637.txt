We love this place so much we have been there four times in the past three years. Best taken in small chunks if you can do so. Machu Picchu is a must, but the Inca trail is for the very fit only. Cuzco is loaded with history. The people are fantastic. Many backpackers, good internet cafes. Lots of tours available at different prices for different age groups, interests
