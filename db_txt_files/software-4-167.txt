Best features are a good set of useful plug-ins, ease of updating, and security (because it is not a targe tof hackers like Explorer is.) The interface is slight more simple than competitors. Disadvantage is that it lacks and integrated HTML editor like Netscape composer. There are a few bugs, mainly related to sound and video, but they are rare enough so as not to bother me. there may be speed differences, but Explorer, Netscape, and Firefox, don't seem dramatically different to me. It may depend upon one's computer and network setup.
