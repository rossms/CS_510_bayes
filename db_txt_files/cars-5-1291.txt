Drove an XJR - Unbelievable! Classy Interior - beautiful wood, fine leather high class all the way! The exterior is superb - nothing like it! I'm truly surprised Lexus hasn't copied it yet. Well here's the best part of the story - the Jag XJR is a BEAST! When I torqued it up and mashed the pedal to the metal this bad boy just smoked the tires all the way throught the first three gears! 50 foot of black streaks! Personality, Class and Brut Power - Make mine Jag XJR!!!!
