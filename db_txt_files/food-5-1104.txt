One of my favorites, a great alternative for M Ms if you are allergic to chocolate. But I only eat them in small doses now, because after a certain point I start to get sick of them and I go for a couple weeks until I buy another bag. And I haven't tried it this way, but I bet it tastes pretty good if you eat these and M Ms at the same time.
