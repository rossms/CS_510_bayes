the goo goo dolls are an amazing band. their music completely touches me. johnny rzeznick is a beautiful man. he has a beautiful face, body, and above all...a beautiful voice. he and robby are very talented and all of their lyrics relate to my personal life. they are by far my favorite band of all time.
