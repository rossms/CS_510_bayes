Prepared me well for my job as an architect in Japan. I passed the ARE architect's exam in one sitting in 1995. The education I received was VERY complete and well rounded. And in addition the fees were quite reasonable for an Out-of-Stater. I was very happy to be there. The relaxed atmosphere of the lifestyle in Hawaii also helped in my studies. Everything about the school I enjoyed.
