Pixy Stix were classic candy items at my baseball and football games when I was younger. I wouldn't advice eating them excessively however, due to health problems that it can cause...example: It rubs your tongue raw, and the excessive amount of sugar can cause blood-sugar problems. But in moderation, this is a great candy product.
