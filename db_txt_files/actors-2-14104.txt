I didn't realize what a bad actress Denise Richards is until I saw her in World is not Enough. Her lank of talent was accentuated by the fact that the other hot, female star of this movie, Sophie Marceau, really CAN act. Denise Richards as a nuclear physicist? I'm not sure if I'm ready to buy that yet...
