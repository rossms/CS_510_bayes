After reading quite a few comments, I submit mine. Don't let the attitude of a few bias you against any state. As for construction I have never been through any state that didn't have road work being done - (Do you really want to drive on bad roads at 80 miles an hour?) PA is a beautiful state, look at the beauty not the few unfriendly, slovenly, or whatever you beef is. How often we look only at the bad - look for the good first and yo won't think about the bad. (small minds do the later)
