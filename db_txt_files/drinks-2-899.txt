My apologies to all those Heineken lovers out there, but this beer is just not pleasant to drink. It is skunky, over-carbonated, and just heavy enough to make it bothersome to drink a bunch in a row. I respect Heineken as a quality beer from a quality brewery - I just don't think it tastes very good.
