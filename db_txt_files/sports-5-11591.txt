One of the best coaches I have ever seen. He has so little funding that he is forced to confine almost all recruiting to Hillsborough county but still manages to field a good team. He has led the team to division 1A faster than anyone else in the history of college football. Every year he has no quarterback yet is able to create a solid offense based on the strengths of the players he has. Oh yeah, the program's first game seven years ago they won 80-3.
