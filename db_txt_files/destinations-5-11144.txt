I used to travel down there every couple of weekends to see my girlfriend and I always enjoyed the sights and sounds of Virginia beach. Rollerblading along the boardwalk, walks at night on the beach, sun and sand during the day, Sunday brunch at Rudy's Inlet (you have to try that place -- the crabs benedict are awesome), bike riding throught the park. Everything was amazing.
