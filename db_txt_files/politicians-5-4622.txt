A great man. A good, kind-hearted, intelligent politician who with Bush has done a fine job in my view. I'm ashamed at the lot of you, saying such cruel things about Mr. Cheney. Long live Mr. Cheney, I hope you live a hundred years! I hang on to the thin hope of Mr. Cheney running in 2008 :) I would also like to thank Mr. Cheney for coming to my high school back in 2000. Four more years!
