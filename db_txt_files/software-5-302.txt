I've really been impressed with OSX. When I switched to a Mac about a year ago - the OS was my biggest concern. I had remembered back in the day when I used to use Macs how fun they were to use, and how unstable they were. How they would constantly crash, and run out of juice. Well, those issues are now a thing of the past. OS X is fast, stable, and a pleasure to use. When you shut down the computer, it shuts down in seconds, not minutes. When you log on the computer, it boots up in seconds, not minutes. Incredibly stable, incredibly fast.
