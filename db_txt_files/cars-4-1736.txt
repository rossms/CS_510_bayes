My husband and I purchased a Certified Pre-owned PT Cruisier year 02. Haven't had any problems with it at all in over 2 years!! FYI - If you haven't owned one you should not post ...My husband and I both NEVER thought of buying one but it was listed in the Consumer Digests 'Good Buys' so we looked into one (hey, what could it hurt right?). We were underwhelmed by the Automatic - however the Manual (which we own) and the new Turbos have good power. Never had noise issues with ours - and I've seen alot uglier cars out there (the Boxes on wheels....) :)
