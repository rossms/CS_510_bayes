I feel as if I ought to be ashamed to admit it, but, I, as a 20-something female, found Bridget Jones's Diary very tiresome. I had high expectations for the book - it was sent to me by my closest girlfriend (who loved it)...but I grew very impatient with the calorie counting, cigarette log, and whining. My biggest complaint (and maybe I missed the point) was that it reduced both men and women to hopeless, pitiful creatures.
