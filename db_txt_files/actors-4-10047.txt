It cannot be easy trying to get a career going when both parents were movie stars. Having to prove yourself. I have liked some of the roles she has done. she was good in A Fish Called Wanda, and recently she did a very good job as the mom who switches bodies with her teenage daughter and has to act like a teenager most of the movie. Funny movie. I am also glad she could be in other types of movies other than the horror ones she had to start out in.
