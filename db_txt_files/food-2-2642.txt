I'm sorry Hershey's lovers, but I don't see what the big deal is. Hersheys chocolate is OK if there's nothing else around but I'd rather have a Toblerone, Dove chocolate or Ghirardelli any day. Hershey's is gritty and has a weak chocolate taste to me. It's not terrible but I just don't get it when people go on about how wonderful this stuff is.
