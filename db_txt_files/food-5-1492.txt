The best kind of Halloween candy you can get. It comes in such a cute, small box and you can eat a whole box still wanting more. They just feel so funny in your mouth, all these little guys rolling around in there. You can even mix the colors and still get a great taste. Plus they've got such a great box, it reminds me of the Snorkels cartoon. It's like you're eating one. Even though it doesn't fill you up it leaves you with a smile.
