In absolute terms, Circuit City is probably about a 3.5. But in relative terms, compared to sucky Best Buy (I call it Worst Buy), I give CC a 2000. Superior merchandise, their staff has some clue, and their prices are reasonable. All Best Buy does is advertise out the wazoo and pass the cost of their crappy products onto you.
