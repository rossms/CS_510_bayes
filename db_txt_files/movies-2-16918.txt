Lindsay Lohman was good in this film and I usually like Michelle Pfiffer, but watching this film just made me feel icky. Not a pleasing film at all. Lohman grew up with a cold hearted fish(and that's putting it nicely) for a mother who murders her boyfriend using white oleander. Lohman is sent to various foster homes which are just a tad better than what she grew up in.
