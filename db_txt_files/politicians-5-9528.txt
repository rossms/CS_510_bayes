The last angelic president we've had. What I like about him is his simplicity, honesty and even piety. Was faithful to his wife and championed the rights of the oppressed. ... He's a much better leader than Bush43. At least Carter never had to drop a bomb in his 4 years. And he never kept secrets from the press unlike Nixon and Bush43. Carter had an open, informal administration. God bless Jimmy Carter.
