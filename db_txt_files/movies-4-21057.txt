Having been in bands at the same time...I thought this movie was pretty well done. Not entirely correct but does give you the feel of Jim and the culture then...Val did a good job in this. Jim was absolutely fabulous looking then. Almost sur-real! I was in the audience in when he stripped. It was quite an event! Val definately leaves you with the flavor. The flavor was bittersweet - like Jim's life. Loved the DOORs.
