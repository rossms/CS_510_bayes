What a foul and terrible waste of Jim Carrey's talent. This movie was little more than eye candy with ridiculous subplots. I was not at all impressed at this film that I thought would do at least a little justice to the Chuck Jones cartoon version. Sad to think that this movie was the highest grossing of the year.
