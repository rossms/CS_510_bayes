I love these cookies!!!!! They're one of my favorite types of cookies and I get about 17 boxes each year. They're very addicting so be careful! I'm a huge mint fan, but I don't like things TOO minty, and thin mints are just the right amount! If you haven't tried them, you've never been in heaven. TRY ONE!!!
