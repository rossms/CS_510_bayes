a 2.5. we only have this because it is the only cable company in our area so we are forced to go with them. they are the biggest crooks. it is outrageous what they charge . and for every teir you go up, so do the prices. We have been considering getting a dish but want to do some more homework on that since it would mean a contract. I would not reccomend comcast to anyone.we resent being forced to go with this rip off of a cable company that can charge whatever they wish.
