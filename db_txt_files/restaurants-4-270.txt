I like their burgers and fries...but you got to be quick to eat them or they won't taste good anymore. Just hate to wait in the long drive-thru lines!! And the service? i've had good and bad...but that's just what you get in about every fast food restaurant. Most of the staff are teenagers with a first time job.
