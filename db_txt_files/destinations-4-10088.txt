Availible just about everywhere. Do yourself a favor and get the mediums instead. Red's/Mediums are probably your best bet if you want a no-nonsense, quick nicotine delivery----Highest crack/concetrated nictone of all brands i think. They taste pretty good and have that yummy yet-chemical marlboro aftertaste (synthetic buttery chocolate to me). Good draw. Camels taste cleaner (but not as good) and Newports are a better smoke/draw (menthol can be unsustainble after awile though) But it seems Red's are toally engineered to taste good and become highly addicting. Just cant stick with them.
