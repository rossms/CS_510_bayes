I went to Davidson for four years (1983-1987). I worked my butt off and felt lousy on the day of graduation. What upset me the most was that I received a liberal arts education but the college did not prepare me to work in the real world. I have been out for 18 years and feel that Davidson did me more of a disservice than a service. I wish I had attended a state school that had degrees in BUSINESS, EDUCATION, NURSING, etc., where you can receive a degree with marketable skills!!!! David W. Class of 1987
