I have had mine since the day it was released in the US. The movies look great. The sound is a decent but I do recommend getting either of the external speakers from Logitech if you want better sound. I love the games that I have played (Infected, GTA: LCS, Twisted Metal, Untold Legends). I have messed with the Homebrew a little bit but they only thing I liked was the Emulators. The web browser is nice although I wish the cache size could be bigger then 2 MB. I would definitely recommend this over s DS any day. Enjoy!
