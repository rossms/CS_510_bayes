Bates is a great school unlike Bowdoin, the preppy school, and Colby, the jock school, Batesies are really intelligent, socially conscious, borderline hippy types...there's a real sense of community at Bates with everyone looking out for one another academically, and there are tons of activities on campus...all around great school with an excellent faculty too!
