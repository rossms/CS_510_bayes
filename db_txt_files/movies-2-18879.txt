Stephen King has never been my favorite author...and most of the time his movies are just as bad. The case of IT is a little different. The movie would have been so much better if it wasn't made for television. I did the think it had a good creepy vibe..but could have been so much creepier if it was on the big screen. I hope they do a remake of it someday in Hollywood as it has so much more potential than this...
