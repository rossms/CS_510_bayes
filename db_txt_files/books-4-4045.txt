This is a very good book, passionate and indignant, and in addition is a book that made a difference in history by calling attention to a terrible social problem, the way some of Dickens' books lit up the dismal sweatshops of 19th century England. The Grapes of Wrath is not always well-written--sometimes you stumble over a clumsily written paragraph like a tree root on a trail; I wish he had given it one more editing pass before sending it to the publisher. Yet I've read it twice and find it terrific overall.
