I thought the plot was missing something. I think the beginning of the movie, as in the first 7 minutes, was amazing and I was so excited about the movie. Then as the plot got going, it wasn't as good. I am a huge Jodi Foster fan since Silence of the Lambs so I still really like the movie. It was also refreshing that the plot didn't revolve around a man and woman romantic relationship.
