I learnt how to play this at the age of 4 I had a natural talent in 1996 when I was 7 I won the regional tournament so was best for my age in Liverpool In 2000 I was second best for my age Oh and I never practised:) Too bad they don't do it anymore in high school and all the kids who still do it are really good as they have private coachs etc. which I couldnt afford
