This car is definatly under-rated. It is one of the most reliable, dependable cars I have ever owned. (Maybe that is why I've got 3 of them.) The All-Trac/GT-4 is an absolute classic. Fun, sporty, fast and definatly ahead of its time. The Celica also has deep roots in rally racing where it has dominated the world championship again and again. The 3SGTE is probably one of the best 4cyl. motors in the world, maybe thats why they use it in Japanese GT Supras?
