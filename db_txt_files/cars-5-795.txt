I've been very pleased with my GT. I didn't want to spend a ton on a mountain bike but I certainly wanted one that would stand up to test and my GT certainly did just that. I spent a month and 1,200 miles in Mexico on my GT loaded down with about 50lbs on the rack and it never let me down and I was riding on some pretty poor roads. In fact the only thing that let me down was the rack (blackburn)everything else held up and is still holding up. I've been very impressed and wouldn't hesitate to buy another.
