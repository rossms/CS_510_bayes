Thanks God,we,humans are so different.One loves rock,the other adores Enya,teenagers are crazy for Britney and company,millions like latin sounds.So what can we do about it? To fight among ourselve whose music is better or worse? No,let us enjoy the beauty of the sounds we like the most. I like Ricky Martin and it really hurts to read how many of comments here are so disrespectful as they haven't been written by humans but by some strange unknown race.
