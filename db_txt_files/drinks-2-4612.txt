As each year passes, I dislike Coca Cola more and more. I just don't care for it anymore since they got rid of the glass bottles. I know they have those small glass bottles now, but they are too expensive, and they never put them on sale. But if you drink Coca Cola ice cold in a glass bottle, it is the best cola in the world, and that is no joke. But unfortunately, mass marketing and greed has ruined the flavor of this all American soft drink...:(
