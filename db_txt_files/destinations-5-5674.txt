I'm a bit biased since this is the only state I've lived in, but I love the good ol' Bay State. From the beautiful Berkshire mountains of Western Massachusetts to the nice beaches of Cape Cod, I think it's one nice state. There are lots of nice places and historical landmarks to visit and lots of fun things to do. The best thing about Massachusetts right now is the New England Patriots won the Superbowl!
