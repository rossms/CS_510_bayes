REALLY, REALLY don't see what the hype is with this movie. I saw it, and just kept going through my checklist of things to expect until the long three hours were over. I've read the books, and maybe it's the fact that I can't stand to see or read anyhting twice but this movie didn't do a thing for me. Only reason I suppose I'm giving it a two is because I feel that maybe I would have enjoyed it had I not already known the story.
