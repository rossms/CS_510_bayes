This sytem is phenominal. Of course it's attracted. Probably some people would rate this terrible because of it's design or it was made by Microsoft. It doesn't matter of it's design or whoever made it. It really matter's of how fun it is. And you critizers probably never even played one. PLus Nicklp73's right. This is better than GameCube or PS2. I like PS2 but GameCube sorta sucks. I really urge all of you to drop the GameCube and buy this system. There's also better games for the X-Box, LIke Shadow ops an Halo. It's awesome, trust me. There nuff said. Now get outta here.
