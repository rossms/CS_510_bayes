GOD created one country which acted like a world on its own. I'm amaze how many things to see. Beautiful architecture, Beautiful people and Beautiful fashion makes this the number one destination place in the world to visit without bias. Food, drinks are simply best. My best vacation and only one I could think that rivals it would have to be Hawaii. I visited Roma and Vatican, Palermo(Sicily), Pompeii, Naples, Isle Capri, Milan, Verona, Venice, Rimini, Riccionne, Florence, and Pisa. I thank Italian People for helping our stay as best I could expect a vacation trip to be. I LOVE ITALIA!!!!!
