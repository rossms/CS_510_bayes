The articles are fine, for introductions to topics, but I agree with the person who noted that the articles were written for children. But the encyclopedia seems to be everywhere--in the reference departments of libraries, for sale in supermarkets, online--not just in schools. If you're looking for an encyclopedia, it seems you can't escape The World Book. It's too bad that the publishers of the World Book don't have an edition for older readers (as Grolier has with its multimedia encyclopedia and the Americana vs. the New Book of Knowledge, for example).
