In the brief time I've spent here, I have been impressed with all the variety Rhode Island has to offer in such a small space. The bay and ocean views are spectacular, the small towns and villages are every bit New England, and cities like Naragansett and Newport are filled with history and beautiful homes. All this, plus a good-sized (not too large) airport in Providence make RI a viable, underrated vacation experience.
