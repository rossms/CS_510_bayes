Billy Ray Sims was by far one of the most prolific running backs in high school as well as college football history. He was the greatest that I ever saw and for someone to state that this man was overrated. Well they are either a Texas fan or a Nebraska fan and they know nothing about the game of football. In four years in the pros he rushed for 5100 yards and had another 2600 recieving yards. His career was abruptly halted by a severe knee injury. Project those numbers over 10 years and he breaks every yardage record that was relavent during his era. Terrance Knox New Jersey
