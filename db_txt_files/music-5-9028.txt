A feel good video that matches the feel good vibe of the song. I mean what's not too like about this video? It has monkeys, bears, a giraffe, puppies - it's like watching the discovery channel while listening to Weezer. My favorite part of the video is the monkey being thrown up into the air slow motion to the instrumental solo...
