These are my regular smokes. They are very smooth and have a pleasant flavor. I used to smoke Marlboro Lights but when I tried Camels I noticed that they don't have the weird newspaper-like taste that Marlboros seem to have. They definetely pack a decent buzz for a light cigarette and I haven't gotten tired of them yet.
