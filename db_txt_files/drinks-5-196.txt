Introduced to me by a friend and his father. They were from, where else, Newcastle! (They are both, also I might add, slightly Alcoholic...) This is easily the best ale I have ever had, bar none! I grew up drinking piss water beers like Bud and Coors, now I won't touch them. Broonale has made me a beer snob. The taste is a bit sweet for ale, but that's what makes it so great. I actually will not drink beer at all at a party if I can't find Broonale to bring or something at least comparable (Yuengling or Sam Adams). The best ale in the world.
