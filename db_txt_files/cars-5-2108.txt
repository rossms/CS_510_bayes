What can I say. I picked up a 1992 Sandstone Metallic Colored SC400 with 63K miles on it for 15K. It is a steal. This is in a class of sports car above the rest. The design has been tested over time. Nothing for the money can even come close to this one. Quiet, powerful, sleek, and beautiful. It is no accident this one is the one to have for Sport's Luxury.
