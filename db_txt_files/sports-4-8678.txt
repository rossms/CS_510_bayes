C-Web is a very good power forward. But not in the short list of great players. He has been accursed; first, scandal in high school, then more scandal in college and the Time Out debacle in the NCAA finals. Then there's his NBA career. He has been the albatross for the so-many near misses by the Sac-of-Tomato Queens. This year, he played through pain and you gotta give him credit (although I could have made that lay-up in Game 7 against the T-Wolves). I think he is ready to try his luck for another NBA team.
