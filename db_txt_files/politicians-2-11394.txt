i think ol'Teddy has been around too long and has committed one too many indiscretions to be taken seriously. he is a whipping boy for conservatives that have no pointed attacks and just want to throw mud. I cringe when Teddy comes out in support of something i believe in, not b/c it's wrong of him to speak his mind, but the actual pressence of the guy has a tendency to invalidate any intellectual discussion on a topic. if i were democratic leaders i would be looking for a strong voice such as the one Kennedy has, just not in the form of him
