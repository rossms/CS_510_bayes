Nestea is good Ice tea. I like the taste, it's better than lipton, I drink nestea when I fee like a nice cold glass of Ice Tea. I love the sweeter taste, and I love the hyper feel you get after drinking a few glasses of it. I like the tangy taste it leaves on your tounge, it's kinda like a blow-pop! nestea ice tead is cool and It's very refreshing!
