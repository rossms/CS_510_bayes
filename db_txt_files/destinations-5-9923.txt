These are suprisingly good. I'm not really a fan of light cigarettes but this is definitely still a real cigarette, not some lame crap. It tastes really good and I actually like it better then the regular Filters because they taste a bit sweeter or something. These are way better then Marlboro Lights. Those really suck. They taste all artificial but with these you actually taste the tobacco. Definitely a good smoke.
