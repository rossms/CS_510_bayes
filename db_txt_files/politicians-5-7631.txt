No other president had to deal with a civil war, letalone survive and succeed. He held the virtue of his office when others would have crumbled or amicated a split into 2 nations. Not driven by popular opinion, he was often an island amid storm after storm. We can only surmise how much greater his presidency could have been if he were to finish his term/ been reelected.
