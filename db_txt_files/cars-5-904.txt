I own a 2003 Kawasaki 1100 STX DI. I have never had a problem with it. Its done 75 hours in 10 months. I have serviced it twice and use it most weekends. I can tow skis, wake boards and tubes. I can wave jump it up wards of 3 metres and can carry 3 passengers at a time (not while wave jumping). Top speed of 103 km/h on Brisbane River. Great Toy if you look after it. Fairly fuel efficient getting upwards of 100km per trip.
