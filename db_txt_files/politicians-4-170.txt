Hard to add what Irishgit already wrote --he fought a tremendous battle at Stamford Bridge, giving Harold Hardrada the six feet of English earth he was promised. (This was one of the most serious military defeats the Vikings ever suffered, and perhaps the beginning of their decline). When he arrived at Hastings he attempted to fight before his troops were ready, and he STILL almost won.
