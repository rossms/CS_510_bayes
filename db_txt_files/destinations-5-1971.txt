Bulgaria is a fairly peaceful country with beautiful nature. If you find a way to make a lot of money here, you can even forget that our government is dumb and stupid. Bulgarians are friendly people, but llef1000du is right that not so many people speak English (and Bulgarian is hard). However, if you visit the capital, you can surely make your way around.
