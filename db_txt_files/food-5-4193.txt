I rarely purchase Cheetos due to the fact that I have absolutely NO willpower whatsoever. I can eat an entire bag (the large bag, not that itty bitty snack pack) in about 8 minutes. Much like other snackfoods, you can't eat just one..that is doubly true for me and Cheetos. Once my fingers and mouth have that initial orange residue stain, I just can't see stopping.
