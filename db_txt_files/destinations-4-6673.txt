Positive Attributes: Having been to West Virginia many times, I must say that I have grown fond of the state. There roads are comfortable to drive on, and the scenery, espescially on I-79 is just breathtaking. The people are amazingly friendly as well. Negative Attributes: Unfortunately, the state is plagued by poverty and has not been able to use its beautiful assets to its advantage to attract visitors.
