Philadelphia is extremely underrated as a city. Ha caligula, how many people did you meet in Philly to generalize as the rudest people you ever met? Personally, I think that they are the most tight knit, loyal, and real people I've ever met. I'm sorry Philly is not Boston, D.C., Chicago, S.F. or LA because they are so refined (oh wait! no I'm not. Philly is original and if you don't get it, see ya later).
