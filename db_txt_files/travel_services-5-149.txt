KLM is great! Their planes look neat and the blue/white colors give a very safe feeling. Their food is good for airplane food and the flight attendants are efficient and friendly. I love Amsterdam airport Schiphol, it is much better than Heathrow. A pitty that they put you in a Northwest plane as soon as you arrive at an American hub.
