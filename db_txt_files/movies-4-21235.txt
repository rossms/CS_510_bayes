I don't think a Chorus Line was ever meant to be a well-acted musical. But although it really did not go well as a movie, I do find it a tad bit underrated. The dancing in the movie is actually pretty fantastic. Visually it works well for me everytime I see it. Not a classic but really not all that bad either.
