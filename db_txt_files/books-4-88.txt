Not nearly as good as his second book, Have a Nice Day , and I would not really reccomend it to anyone who is not or has never been a pro-wrestling fan, because this one is much more wrestling-oriented than its successor. This 500+ page book was definately worth reading, and once again, it was written in black ink on notebook paper by Mick Foley himself.
