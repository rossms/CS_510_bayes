Amazing! I went there on vacation with some friends from college, and had a blast. We stayed at the Holiday Inn in Grand Haven. The women are hot and the beer is cold. Also, there are some of the best beaches I have ever seen. Infact, other than spring break during college and my first trip to Las Vegas that was the best vacation I have ever had.
