I have only been to Boston a couple of times, but it is a really fun town. It would get a 5 star rating in my book if only the people there were not the personification of a Mass-hole. OK, your sports teams suck and it does get knid of miserable there in the winter, but there is no reason for you people to be so rude and single-mided (on the whole - this by no means is stereotyping all who live in the area).
