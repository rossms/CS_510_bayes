Had my QCP-860 for about a week now and I love it! The sound quality is the best and it also has a lot of features. Most people complain about the antenna sliding down but if you pull out the antenna tight, it shouldn't slide back down. Never had a problem with mine. It has a thin, sleek design and fits nicely in my hand. Great phone!
