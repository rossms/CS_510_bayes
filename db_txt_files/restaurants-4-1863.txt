I like the bell. Of all the places to stop for a quick meal while road tripping I would pick Wendy's...but if there wasn't a Wendy's then the Bell is where I'd go. Decent tasting, fast, probably not as bad for you as greasy chicken, or fat filled burger, (especially if you get something vegetarian like beans, rice, and vegetable) and inexpensive. It also doesn't give you that really heavy full of grease feeling I often get after polishing off a coupl'a cheeseburgers and fries.
