I really like this phone. It's very cute. Mine has a transclucent pink cover that I love. (I haven't ever seen a cuter phone). Yea I know I keep talking about how cute it is. But it's also neat that you can compose your own ringers. It has voice dialing, a wide variety of nice ringers already on the phone, and it's easy to send text messages. What little things there are wrong with it, the good things make up for it.
