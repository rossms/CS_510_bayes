For about $8 a bottle this is Chardonnay is pretty hard to beat. I recently picked up about three bottles of Chardonnay each from a different producer and all within about a $5 range of each other. The Forest Glen was on the cheaper side but was actually quite pleasant and I wouldn't distinctly worse than the other more expensive bottles, (one was a Lindeman's and the other a Mondavi). Crisp, with a lightly sharp taste it went very well with a plate of mussels.
