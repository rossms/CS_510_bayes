While I'm not totally sold on these guys, Steve McNair is doing good things with this team. He truly is a winner with a lot of talent, and he wills this team to victory sometimes. The defense is opportunistic, and I think they will make the playoffs as (at least) a wild card team this year. I expect some bumps along the way, especially since Eddie George can't get it done anymore, but 10-6 is reasonable. If McNair gets hurt, this team could be in trouble.
