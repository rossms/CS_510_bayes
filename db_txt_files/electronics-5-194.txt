I think this is the new Sony 40 sec. anti-skip Cd player. It was enxpensive (over $100) but the product is awesome. I dropped the player, and it did not open, nor did it skip. Running also causes it no problems. Battery life is terrific too. 2 AA's lasted for several months of use (approx. 5 hrs/week).
