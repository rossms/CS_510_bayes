He's a decent actor, but i'd like to see him play something besides the angry black man. like he did in star-wars. (how the heck he got picked to be a jedi master, i'll never know) but it was nice to see him shake off the tough black guy role for a movie. i'd like to see him in a more serious, down-to-earth role. and as many movies as he does, maybe i'll get that soon.
