My dad has a 2001 ES. I like when he lets me drive it. The ride is smooth,it handles well, nice wood finish inside the car. Its's kinda just a better looking Camry, when you pop the hood there's Toyota stickers all over the parts. But you pay for then name I guess. Still I doubt my dad regrets paying more for it then getting the V6 Camry which costs not too much cheaper anyways.
