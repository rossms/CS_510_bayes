My second favorite Island in the Caribbean! St. Thomas offers the security of being within the US territories and also, the people all speak english very well and the US dollar is the prevelent currency used. I've been to St. Thomas 6 times now and my wife and I will continue to vacation there when we can. Good shopping, nice people and tropical paradise rolled in to one destination.
