The man has done absolutely nothing for the country since he's been in power (1997). And more and more everyday he uses ingenuity to find ways to increase the burdens on the taxpayers. He has a cunning style of distorting, distracting and distancing (himself from) everything. At any rate, the Brits love it! I'm also afraid his successor stands a good chance of capitalising on this as the populace wont take any opposition party seriously. If he ran America for a month, they'd soon realise that it takes more than an accent.
