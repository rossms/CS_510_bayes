I really enjoyed this book. The story was compelling and the characters were interesting. Although I thought John Galt's speech towards the end was a bit much (if you've read that far, then you get the idea), the story clearly described Ayn Rand's philosophy within a strong story. Atlas Shrugged really drew me in, unlike The Fountainhead. I was reluctant to read this book since I wasn't particularly pleased by The Fountainhead, but am really glad I did.
