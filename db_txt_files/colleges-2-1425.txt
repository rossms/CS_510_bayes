A big time school without it's own football stadium? Go to the U of Minn and you'll miss out on one of college's greatest memories - Football Saturday. Ask any college grad from a legit school that has their own stadium and they'll agree. The academics here are fine, they're a Big Ten school. The campus itself is an afterthought in a city as large as Minneapolis. Plus, the school colors and mascot have to be considered among the worst in the nation.
