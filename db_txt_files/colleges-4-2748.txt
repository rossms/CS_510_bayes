I just finished my degree in Business Managment at UoP. After the first few classes I was having doubts, mainly because of the amount of work you put in. However, everything that is taught is real-world, not just the theory that you learn at a traditional university. Traditional universities are not for the average working adult, which is where UoP has identified a problem and offered a solution. As with any experience, you get out what you put in.
