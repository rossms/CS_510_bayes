Don't believe the hype. Unless you are from Iowa or Kansas you should know that the best pizza is from your local Italian pizzaria ot some chain dump. I am not a American and don't expect you to know that it is the crust that makes the pizza...not the cheese....cheese and toppings are how they cover up their shitty product!
