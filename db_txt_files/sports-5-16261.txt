I have been a Bills fan all my life and what happened with Doug last year was the most embarassing thing in Bills history. What the man lacks in hieght he makes up in heart! The man is a winner and should play the rest of this season no matter what! Johnson may be the future but if Doug gets benched, the Bills will miss the bus!!
