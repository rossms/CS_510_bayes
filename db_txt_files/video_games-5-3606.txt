I enjoy the game because of the superior graphics to other racing games, the amount of different cars you have to choose from (variety of cars), the amount of different tracks, and the option of playing them backward. I also enjoy it because of the tournaments and the possible car upgrades. No matter how good you get at the game there is a harder challenge to come.
