The Yankees always have been and always will be the best team in MLB. I am a Lakers fan and relate well to the Yankees and Yankees fans because everyone else hates us only because we always win.Both teams are on the same boat because they dominate their sport and are the most powerful, glamorous franchises for their sport. The Red Sox are an Ok team, but they lack the magic and power of the Yankees. To the Yankees and the fans, keep your head up, no need to worry about the Sox and those other pesky teams who think they can beat the Yankees but they really can't.
