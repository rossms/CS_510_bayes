Smoke these a lot, but they've never quite become a regular for me....more like a weekend or going out type of cigarette. These smokes are good...very much like a Marlboro light, but better flavor. Recessed filter is kind of funky, but I actually like it better than a regular old filter....I wish more cig makers did this. Very consistent too....I've never had a bad one.
