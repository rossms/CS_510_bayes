This is above and beyond the smoothest brew I've ever tasted. Now a lot of beer aficionados will criticize Blue Moon for not being a real Belgian white. Who cares? Does that magically make it stop tasting good? I like Blue Moon because it does have all the sweetness of a traditional Belgian wheat beer without the weird, candy-like bubblegum finish of real Belgian whites like Hoegaarden (which is still a fine, fine beer) and others. This is a great step up beer for fans of more popular wheat beers like Boulevard Wheat and Sunshine Wheat.
