Carlos, having recovered from an injury-plagued year is leading the Blue Jays in a GREAT ride. He and Vernon Wells, soon to become the BEST outfielder in the AL, are pushing the Jays to excel a year or two early. This is a GOOD team -- but June will tell the tale. If they are still close, they have a chance. After the horrible schedule they were given in APRIL [ most games against last years' best teams] they have recovered remarkably well.
