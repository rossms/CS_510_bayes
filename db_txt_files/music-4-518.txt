This group has matured since their days of being a punk/funk party band known for going on stage wearing only strategically placed tube socks, and they show their maturity on this album. Their music is really tight on this record and the guitarist John Frusciante's playing is amazing. This record is very good, but it doesn't hold up to their 1991 album Blood Sugar Sex Magik.
