I have used Air France many times over the past 25 years due to family living in France. I have always had a great experience. Everyone is always very nice and will go out of their way to be very helpful. I've never had any major delays. I once fell asleep at the airport in between flights and they came to find me before the plane left me stranded. Now that's customer service. Their food is good considering it's airline food. I recommend highly!
