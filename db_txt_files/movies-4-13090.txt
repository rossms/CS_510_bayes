a good movie about the horrors of the Holocaust. Filmed in black and white. Some very good performances. Very realistic and disturbing as it should be. Schindler ran a factory and gave work to jewish people which helped save their lives. a very long movie and hard to watch knowing that what is shown really happened. A 4.5 to me.
