I love the hamburgers and the fries so much I never order anything else from their menu. Yes, they have messed up my order on occassion but all the other fast food places have too. I saw the biography on Dave Thomas the other day and have a lot of respect for the man. He worked his way from the bottom of the restaurant business to being an owner of one of the biggest fast food chains. He doesn't seem to be corrupted by it. I never worked at Wendy's so I do not know what kind of person he is to work for.
