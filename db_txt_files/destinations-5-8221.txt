I visited Las Vegas for the first time in October of 2000... I had a blast! The Stratosphere Tower was one of the highlights! People kept telling me before I went that I should go try the rides at the top of the 1000-foot tall tower... so I did. I rode the Big Shot. It zips you straight up into the air and leaves your dangling for a few seconds over a thousand feet above the ground. I did it at 9:00p.m., and all I could see for miles around were the lights of the city. It was truly breathtaking... in more ways than one!!!
