I have a 1999 Grand Cherokee Limited with 120,000 miles. I've had it for exactly 2 years and am trying to trade it in now. I had to replace my rotors 3 times already. I put new rotors on in April 04 and I was told that they need to be replace again and it's only August 04. I feel that the vehicle overall is cheap and poorly made. aiscls
