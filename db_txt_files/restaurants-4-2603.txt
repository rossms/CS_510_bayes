I love how all these people on here are trashing the hell out of McDonald's, when you know as well as I do, that in their lifetime, they have probably given this place 1000's of their dollars too. It isn't about the food really, it is the convenience. McDonald's is very fast, efficient, and not necessarily good for you...but it sure is nice not having to cook all the time when you work over 70 hours a week...
