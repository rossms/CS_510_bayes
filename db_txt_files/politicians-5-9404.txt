Good for you, great-great-great-great-great-uncle (and I'm not kidding about that, he's my direct relation!) for standing up to the dumb a**es who complained about your money-spending just because we were in the middle of a depression! Stop blaming poor Martin for it, it wasn't his fault! He just became president at the wrong time. If he had defeated WHH, he probably would have been a sensation! Too many if s!
