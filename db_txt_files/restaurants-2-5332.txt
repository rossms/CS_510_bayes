It's called a steakhouse, but the steak is just OK. I've had better steaks at Copeland's, which isn't listed anyway, so I can't rate that. So we have just average steak, but what about the dessert? Blech! I had a cherry cobbler recently, it was old, the biscuit was spongy, and the cherries themselves were mushy. And since when does a cobbler have a spongy buiscuit-like thing? It's supposed to have crust! A good crust! The restaurant is rather pricy compared to some steak places, and not all that great either. The restaurant itself is rather unclean, but the steak is at least OK.
