We could have had a not worse! Can you say Klinton? Ghore? Dub has been a good president with good intentions. Not everyone will be pleased with everything. My opinion, his only failure is to secure the borders. He buddies up to Mexico President Fox when he should be telling Fox to get lost! Glad Bush was in charge during 9/11!
