This man with decades of football experience isn't behind anything; recruiting sucks, and that's about it. He knows the game better than anyone else here, and quality wins (unlike a certain bowden figure); simply put, he has earned the right to say when he goes -- and I am behind him until he chooses to go on his own terms.
