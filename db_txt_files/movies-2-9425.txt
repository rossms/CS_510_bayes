I saw Father of the Bride when it came out, and I thought it was pretty entertaining. When I saw it again recently, though, I found it slightly nauseating. Everything about it was just too cute, from the plot to the clothes the actors were wearing. I was even annoyed by the Banks' perfectly decorated home and their wholesome dinner conversations. I found myself wishing that some sort of a disaster would ruin the big day. Of course it didn't, and the movie retained its cuteness from start to finish. I guess I just can't stomach cute shows like this anymore.
