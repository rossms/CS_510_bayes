To me, Target is the high class version of Wal-Mart. Again, I wouldn't buy clothes here. I bought a few shirts here and they ended up shrinking significantly! But I'd definitely buy anything else! The stores are a lot cleaner and more organized in comparison to Wal-Mart. I can shop the CD section at Target and everything is actually in alphabetical order!
