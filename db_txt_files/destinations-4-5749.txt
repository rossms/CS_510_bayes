I've been to Florida approximately 8 times and loved it everytime to the point where I use to cry when I returned home growing up. Disney world, EPCOT, MGM studios and Seaworld are fantastic. International Dr is the place to vacation. Its beautiful and the landscaping is awesome. I dont think I could live there thoguh simply because of the snakes, bugs, lizards, alligators, hurricanes and etc. But its one of the most beautiful states I've ever seen. Wonderful vacation spot. .
