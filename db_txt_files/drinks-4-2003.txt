I love Arizona Green Tea! It has become my new drink of choice this summer; I haven't got sick of it yet so hopefully I will indulge throughout the year because unlike soda it leaves me feeling satisfied not bloated and gross. It's honestly a good drink. If only we had more products like this our country would be less obese; I suppose..
