I rented it because of the cast. I love Liam Neeson, Emma Thompson, Alan Rickman, Hugh Grant, etc. I was very pleasantly surprised by how much I enjoyed the film. It is a little bit scattershot sometimes, but there's an overall kind of genius in how the director has interwoven characters and plot lines. I even went back to watch it again and got even more out the subtleties of the story.
