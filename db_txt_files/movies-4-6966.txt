this movie is very funny. The last of John Hughes' run of 1980's teen comedies before he moved on to more family fare(uncle buck, the first two Home Alones, Beethoven). Broderick shines in this, as well as Jeffrey Jones. lots of gags and wonderful shots of Chicago. The movie is on cable too much now in an edited version, so i havent seen Ferris in a long time. perhaps i should buy it considering it only costs $10 at your average chain store.
