This movie is all about special effects, and, since special effects have come a long way since T2 was released, it's easy to forget how ground-breaking it was to see the improved Terminator morph into liquid metal as bullets passed through his body or a shotgun blew his face in half. But the movie has one huge problem: that spectacularly annoying kid (Edward Furlong, I think, is the actor's name). What the hell was the casting department thinking?
