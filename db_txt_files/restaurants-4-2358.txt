I've always liked LJS, but last time I went there I ordered the breaded shrimp and it was nasty! I couldn't even taste the actual shrimp- all I tasted was gross, oil-soaked breading! Bleah! I think I'll stick with the chicken planks, which I usually get. I also like their fries- they're nice and crispy, plus the hush puppies are good, and their slaw is decent. The prices are fairly reasonable, and sometimes they have really good coupon deals.
