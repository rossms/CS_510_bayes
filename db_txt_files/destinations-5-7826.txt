One of my favorite museums of any kind. This is one area where Chicago has kept its greatness. Its museums, including the Art Institute are among the best in the world. The Art Institute is even better than it was in the good old days of my childhood. I concur that the impressionist collection is one of the highlights. I always seek out the works of Renoir who is my favorite in that very distinctive and famous style.
