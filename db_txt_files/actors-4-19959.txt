Not the best or funniest actress on the BUFFY (for flexibility and range I'd have to go with Alyson Hannigan, for pure natural technique I'd pick young Michelle Trachtenberg) but she sure gets the job done, and her soap opera experience seems to stand her in good stead during the more intense dramatic moments. To see what else she can do, rent CRUEL INTENTIONS and leave SCOOBY-DOO on the shelf.
