Jennystenson boy ARE YOU DUMB!!!The Bay state has much going for it- great sea shore, national parks and sites, the second longest history in the USA, great educational institutions, great quality of life, and above all Boston. The negatives are the high costs of housing- from Worcester east. Most states can only envy what this state offers its population- but the price is not free. As far as rating this state because of Senator John Kerry- it goes to prove that many people across the USA are misinformed to be dipolmatic- or just plain ignorant being outspoken.
