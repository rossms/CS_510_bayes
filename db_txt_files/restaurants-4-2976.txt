Haagen-Dazs is good ice cream, no doubt, but it's just too rich for my taste. I really like the frozen yogurt and sorbet, though, which make good selections if you don't want the heaviness of Haagen-Dazs ice cream. I must mention that I find it annoying that the name Haagen-Dazs was invented in order to sound Scandinavian and that the ice cream is manufactured here in the U.S. Somehow that bothers me. Oh, well. Even with ice cream, image is everything.
