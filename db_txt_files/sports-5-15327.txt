The guy doesn't get as much credit as he deserves! One of the most amazing people I've ever seen. He's been through so much, and yet he's still living a wonderful life with a beautiful wife and 2 daughters. He doesn't lie and he isn't full of himself, and he is a dang good football player....p.s the only 3 time MVP almost 4 time...coming soon.
