I would paraphrase what another person said; if you don't like it you are not diabetic...like me. Of course it's not as good as the original!! The word duh comes to mind! I MUST drink diet and this along with Diet Dr. Pepper is one of only two diet sodas I can stand. Diet Pepsi? GAG! Diet Coke? GAG! Diet Mountain Dew Code Red? Cha-Ching!
