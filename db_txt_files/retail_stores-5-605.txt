Oh!......I can't believe some of ya'll are saying abercrombie is better than AE!....First of all the company of AE is way better. WE are all about customer service. Abercrombie's motto is the clothes sell themselves ....so they have crappy customer service. American Eagle has great customer service and a variety of good quality clothes. I have worked there for 2 years its a great place to be. I don't shop at abercrombie because they have to high prices for poor quality clothes!.....So don't knock AE until you try it!
