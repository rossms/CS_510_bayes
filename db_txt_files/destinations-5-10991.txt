This is an awesome park! I love it! They have The Phoenix, ranked as one of the best wooden roller coasters of all time! As well as the Twister, which was voted the best new ride of 1999. It was also voted the best family park a couple of times. It has free admission so you don't have to pay to get in! I've been there 15 times, and it's still my favorite! It is the bomb! Take it from Jorgan von Stingle!
