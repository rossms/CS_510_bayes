One of the best. Frosted Mini-Eheats actually give some semblance of nutrition with all that Wheat! Along with that though you get the sugary frosting of it's flip side, just enough to make the Wheat side bearable. Also, the Mini-Wheat is far superior to the Larger version Frosted Wheat which is burdened by too much Wheat and not enough Frosting. Frosted Mini-Wheat has just the right proportion.
