I believe that Christina has a finer voice than Britney. Her last song obviously sucks! Genie in a Bottle is great, but she didn't write the lyrics. The first of five songs are pretty good and I liked the #10 song Blessed, but the others are only okay. So if you decide to fork some cash over, it wouldn't be a bad move.
