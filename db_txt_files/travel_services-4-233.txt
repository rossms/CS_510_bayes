The food on United is lousy, even in international business class. But the new seats in business class are awesome, almost fully reclining with your own video screen. The airline has become more prompt over the last few years and seems to be on time these days. The mileage plus program is good. Agents are friendly, but sometimes they don't seem to speak good english. It is hard to communicate if you want to change reservations, etc.
