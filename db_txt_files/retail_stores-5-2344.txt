Winco is the best employeer I ever have. Have great benefits and retirement. It is not union but they do take care of their employees. If you work hard, Winco will take care of you. I've been working for them for 11 years and still happy to be there. You cannot make everybody happy, customers or employees but you could shop or work far worst than Winco. I do all my shopping at Winco and I am proud to be an employee there.
