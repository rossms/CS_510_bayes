What a concept, leave it to the Germans to make the best pilsner I have ever had. This is the Budweiser of Germany, but it blows Bud away in every category. This IS the beer to drink on a hot summer day, at the desert, in Vegas, on the river in your boat. I would even say if you have never tried it, search for it, it is well worth it. When Warsteiner exists, it still blows my mind why Bud, Coors, and Miller are still around. This is world class beer.
