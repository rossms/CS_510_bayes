I think that Allen Iverson is one of the most talented pleople I have ever admired. I admire alot of people, for alot of different reasons, but Allen is so real. He plays like he loves it. And lets all his fans know that he loves them. Not to mention his kids. Hes also a wonderful father and husband. I love to play basketball, and if it wasn't for him I probably would of quit trying when i didn't think i was good enough. So all I can say is Thank You Allen for being a true inspiration in my life.
