The people are very nice and down to earth in Pennsylvania. Dont really care for Philadelphia although the pizza and cheese steaks are SLAMMIN. The nice place to live is the suburbs of PA such as Falls Twp, Yardley, and some parts of Morrisville since they are conviently close to Philadelphia, NYC and New Jersey (great for commuters especially), and are quiet areas. The Poconos is a beautiful vacation spot but not the best place to live. I know, since I lived there, plus there is way too much snow with bears in your backyard to top the cake lol. Overall its a wonderful state in my opinion.
