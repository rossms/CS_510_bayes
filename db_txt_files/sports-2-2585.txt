The Atlanta Braves have won every NL East Title since inception of the Wild Card playoff format. Need I say more [Of course, in the playoffs Atlanta always ends up becomming the equivalent of a Bye Week for the other team]. He was hamstrung early on with a small-market approach (I always contend, there is no such thing as a small market, just small owners). Unfortunately, even with a bigger War Chest, Ed Wade just doesn't seem like the guy who can put it all together for the Phillies.
