A great education, filled with professors and students who share a passion for education. If you want to go to school for music, Oberlin is where you want to go. Some music snobs, but not too bad. And you'd be amazed at what you can get away with. No frats or sororities, which for me is a plus. And there's always a wide variety of live music on campus
