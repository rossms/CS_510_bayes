Heiney, more like Hiney, this beer tastes like butt. Skunk butt. Bitter, not smooth, mass produced stuff, its the europeans answer to american mass produced beer, and a bad one at that. But it is trendy, and comes in a nifty green bottle or keg can! The dark is slightly more bearable, but only as a last resort.
