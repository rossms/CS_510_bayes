Let's see.I have had my metro pcs since June of 2002, and I never had much of a promblem with it, except, the same promblems that other cell phones give U...which include..bad signal around many trees, or if U R out of range, other than that, My phone has been great! I go out of town, and when re-entering my phone zone area, I get all of my messages! Hope U have better deals in the future...Proud 2 be your customer! Samantha
