The only knock on Wisconsin is the weather in winter. Milwaukee is top notch and despite what you may hear, is way more fun than Chicago. Madison was voted the best college sports town in the country and you will not beat Green Bay for some great NFL action. If thats not enough, it is very cheap to drink, and there are plenty of places to do it at.
