Great Brown Beer. Made better by the rumor that the Brits who work at the Newcastle Brewery, and have been drinking the stuff for years, are all going gradually insane. This is the most drinkable dark beer that I have ever tasted -nothing beats hanging out and putting back a couple of those giant 20oz(?) newkie browns.
