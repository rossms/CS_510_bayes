Long is a word you could describe it with. So is frightening, amazing, breath-taking and fabulous. Tom Hanks gives another great performance of course, Robert Zemeckis working hard to make a good film, and it turned out good. From the plane crashing and the dark sea at night, to Hanks'es DIY dentistry, this film is a real thrill from beginning to end. Absolute must-see. Summary: TERRIFYING, AMAZING, BREATH-TAKING, LONG FILM.
