Food here is bold but quite tasty. I love to wash down the pasta or chicken dishes with a couple of Fosters. I have never had rude service and this is looking back on many Outback visits in three different states. Yes, I am a fan. It can be noisy, that's true. But I don't go to a No Rules, Just Right place for a quiet dinner by candlelight!
