The only thing that prevents a 5-star in my mind is Stern, and that's just because I can't stand him. As for the rest, an easy 5-star on musical quality, absense of commercials, and availability of signal. No more hunting on the FM band after your favorite stations static away on a long trip. Set it and enjoy it. :)
