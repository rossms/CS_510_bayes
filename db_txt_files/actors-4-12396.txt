I agree with Movie fan, I think this one is very underrated. I've always loved her choice of roles - she likes playing tomboys and she plays them quite well. From the tomboy in Fried Green Tomatoes to the tomboy in that 80s high school movie (I can't remember the name). And then her role in Benny Joon was very interesting. I'd like to see her in more movies. But I've never seen her show I'll be sure to look for it.
