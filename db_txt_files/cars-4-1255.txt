The new Altima is a huge redesign over its terrible pre 2002 designs. Its not as refined as Toyota Camry, or Honda Accord, nor as safe as Ford Taurus, but the Altima is an excellent choice. I reccomend the 240hp V-6. The rear lights are great, since the come standard on all models.Consumer Reports reccomends the Altima, but they said 2.5 Altimas have flimsy cheap plastics.
