I would give this an almost 4. It was listed as a drama, but I would rate it more as a comedy. Al Pacino plays a down on his luck director whose career is about to end when a fan of his gives him a computer program that will create a person this guy dies and leaves the program to the director. now he brings to life Simone and puts her in two of his movies. she becomes an instant success. Now he has to find ways to make her look real when she is not. there are some pretty funny scenes.Al Pacino is good as the director who gets over his head with this made up movie star. Had some good moments.
