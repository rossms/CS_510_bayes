Sao Paulo is Unique. Abundant of excellent Restaurants, Theaters, Night Clubs and Museums Sao Paulo is whats the best out there in my opinion. The people are gorgeous and very polite. Transportation system is very efficient. I also went to the beach which is fairly close, about 2 hours by car, traveling in magnificent highways...Oh my god... The super highways provide you a view of one of most dense forests in the planet. Its breathtaking... SAO PAULO IS THE BEST!!!!!!
