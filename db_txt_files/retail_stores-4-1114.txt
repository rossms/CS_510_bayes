I bellive tha thot topic is a great store if you are unable to find a hole in the wall . I would also like to say taht I am very christian and shop there all the time, yes I used to thnk it was evil as well but then i got a clue and realized that it is just stuff. I also realized that you should never judge people by what they are wearing espcialy if you say you are christian . It's a contradiction of everthing you are taught and we can not have that now can we?
