I've been enjoying several of the Amy's frozen foods for my lunches lately (had one today as a matter of fact). I like the fact that they seem concerned about the contents being organic and healthy. I especially like the burritos. Easy to grab and throw in a lunch box along with a piece of fruit on those days when you slept in a few extra minutes.
