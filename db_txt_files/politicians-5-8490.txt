To the ridiculous idiot smileysmile, who posted that Reagan caused the AIDS crisis, let me educate you on how people get AIDS: they engage, of their own free will, in behaviors that spread the virus. IT is entirely preventable. Same thing with drugs. If an individual has self-control, it's not difficult to say NO to drugs. A man needs to function on his own volition, with reason. Honestly.
