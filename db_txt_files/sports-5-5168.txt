It is an absolute joke that Sampson is ranked so low on this list. It proves to me that these RateItAll users are complete idiots. No NCAA Chamionships doesn't change the fact that he is one of the greatest college players of all-time. He was incredibly athletic, versatile, and a tremendous force in the middle. If his NBA career wasn't curtailed by injuries, he would have been a hall of famer.
