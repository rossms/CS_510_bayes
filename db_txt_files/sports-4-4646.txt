Great coach who is just now reaping the rewards of his greatness. National Champion coach and won the ACC tournament with a middle-of-the-pack team in 2004. He was great going back to BC and Ohio State. His teams are tough and fun to watch. He's not a great recruiter, but manages to get the kids he has to play well for him. Has the job he's wanted in Maryland and has set the table for himself to be there for as long as he wishes. Expect him to continue to field very strong teams with few ,if any, lean years.
