Influential, a better orator than his opponents give him credit for, and has made some good speeches over the years. Is particularly good at hammering away at Bush in recent years. But Chappaquidick, the thing with his nephew, and other big flaws erase all that for me. I do like Bobby's kid Joe, who "bitchslapped," in a verbal sense, some N.Ireland border guard once, and who has helped a lot of elderly and poor people get heating in the winter, a decent man.
