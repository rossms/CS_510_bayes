This one, unlike most Disney movies, leans more towards 3 stars than 5. This was a nice one, good songs, good characters. But what happened??? Lacked more story to it. All of a sudden he just leaves. I wanted the kid to be exposed to the outside world more before he decided to leave the jungle. And that lion wasn't that great of a villian. Overall, it's just another nice one thrown out by Disney.
