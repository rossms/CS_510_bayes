So what the gig with the Cinci jack-a$$es dis'in Pittsburgh?? They must have some sort of issue with the fact that no one gives a damn about Ohio in general. And calling it a rust belt!!!! Take a look at Cleveland, you knuckle heads! Anyway, Pittsburgh is one of the countries top ten most improved cities, it's cleaner, more livable and and over joy to vist. I love visiting Pittsburgh and the new ballpark and stadium show just how dedicated the city is to keep the Bucs and Steelers in town. Way to go Pittsburgers, you have a city to be proud of!
