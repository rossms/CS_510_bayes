I remember this song ruling the charts six years ago all over Europe and most probably in some other places.It was such a good time to hear the song in spanish language to reach to the top.Not that I am spanish native,I don't even speak this language,but feeling was still good just knowing that there have been some other artist from other countries than USA or UK to be able to capture the hearts of the people. Maria was that song and Ricky has entirely deserved all the fame and glory it has come with it.
