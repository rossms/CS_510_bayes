This early 80's arcade game had tremendous appeal to me as a little kid. Concept was to run around, climb ladders, and drop layers of a giant burger down a multi-level factory. In the process, you'd hope to squish meanies with the falling ingredients or to stun them with your small supply of pepper when they chased you. If you lowered all the ingredients of your burgers to the bottom, you'd clear the board and have a bigger challenge. The game combined some fun elements of Pac-Man and Donkey Kong, but received far less media attention. Many an arcade or home Atari fan has fond memories, though.
