I drink more Cokes than I would if more fast food places offered Pepsi instead. But I still wouldn't say Coke does not deserve their status as a high rated soft drink whose logo has become a worldwide cultural icon. Whether you are personally in love with it or not you have to give them credit - they have not only produced a consistently good product for many a year, but may be the best example ever of a marketing mega-success. How else can you explain that the word Coke itself for many people is actually synonymous with soft-drink?
