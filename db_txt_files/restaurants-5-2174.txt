I guess americans don't really understand. Well, from my experience, it's not really the coffee or anything we're proud of, just that it's a way to vent our patriotism. I'm not going attempt to compare it to some american patriotism, since I simply don't know. They do however, have decent food. And for once, a canadian chain is infiltrating the US! Plus, the timbits are just great. Along with the Ice Capps. Mmmmm...Ice Capps...
