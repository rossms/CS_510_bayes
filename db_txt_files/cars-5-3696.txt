Ok, i just want to tell all of you people who think the Expediotn sux, that you are all fu king stupid. It is a great S.U.V. and for you, mill 4387om you are a complete dumba$$, The Transmission is man made so yah it can break and you probably beat the heII out of it. Tahoes suck they say Chevy on them what the heII are you thinking?? and besides the safety and power ratings are much higher on the Expedition than that junky Tahoe
