Only one word for this band. Creative. I'm really stuck on the old hard rock but when i heard them i was instantly addicted. all songs are so diverse. They're not a band that sounds the same on every song. I also love how they incorporate agressive rock screaming /singing/rapping and samples. VERY creative..a fan forever
