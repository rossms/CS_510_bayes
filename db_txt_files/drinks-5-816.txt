This is my favorite out of ALL the beers. I drink this the most. It is good for almost any occasion, it tastes awesome, goes down smooth, never has a bad aftertaste. It makes you feel good, and it helps keep the beer belly stay away. This beer is a must if you are single or courting. I have never been hungover from this beer, and never suspect I will get a hangover from it. I recommend it out of all the beers !
