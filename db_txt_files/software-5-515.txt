A good office suite for the home and the office. If you are running windows. I do suggest, if you got a lower end PC, to stick with your old versions. . It has a great number of options and some of the tings I seen at the Microsoft TouchPoint series and TS2 conferences blew me away! everything intergrates and forms one really cool and really great business solution!
