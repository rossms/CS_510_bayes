One of the most intelligent presidents we have ever had. Like the MO Secretary of State said of him at church one Sunday, he must be doing a wonderful job as president if the other side can't criticize anything but lying to his family about a sex act Not that it is right, and I was deeply disappointed (about the act) but if we threw out all the politicians who have done this, there would be very few people left in Washington or the state capitols.
