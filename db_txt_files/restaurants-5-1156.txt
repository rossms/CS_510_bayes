Love that chicken from Popeyes! How could anyone NOT love it? If you want spicey chicken, this is the place. The mild chicken is spicier than the Colonel's spicy chicken! And the spicy chicken is heaven! Also, I find the chicken is less greasy than at KFC or Church's. And the biscuits... ooh, let me tell you, these things are much better than any homemade biscuit I've ever eaten, but I warn you--the biscuits are pretty greasy. They're much more moist than those dry things at KFC. The price isn't too high either, rather comparable to places like McDonalds, but the food is better.
