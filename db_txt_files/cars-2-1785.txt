i purcahsed a '97 buick lesabre with the hopes of it being my last vehicle for the next ten years. the car rides good and has good power ,but everything good about the car is overshadowed by the sorry gasket failure the engines are prone to. at 50k the plastic manifold allowed water into my engine-killing the car. replaced with low miles used engine and it's leaking water behind the throttle body gasket. i'm telling anyone who will listen to be very wary of these 3800 series ll (L36)engine, i have lost my faith in this car
