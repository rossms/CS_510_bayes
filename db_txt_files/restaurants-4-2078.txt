They have a lot of new franchises in our area which gave me a chance to try them out and they have pretty good subs. They are also Pepsi owned which is a plus. They are a little on the pricey side which makes them more of an occasional visit and they only have a few subs that sound good. One being the chicken carbonara which is delicious. I remembered when they first opened they had this awesome sub but from what I can tell it's gone now. Their Jimmy's Batch 66 Chili sauce is amazing! Make a stop here at least once.
