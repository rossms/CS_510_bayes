Pluses (+): A very, very good actress. I loved her performance in Disclosure - she has a lot of chemistry with Michael Douglas. The Juror was also well done on her part. She really surprised me with her unusual role in A Few Good Men and showed that she has range as an actress. Striptease is a classic. Minuses (-): It is very unladylike to pose in Playboy while you are pregnant.
