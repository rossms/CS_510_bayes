Chris Webber is the new and improved Karl Malone. In my opinion, he's already a little better than Karl Malone ever was (though he needs to be a little more aggressive and tenacious defensively) and, thus, is on his way to becoming the best power forward ever. He has a variety of inside the paint moves, is quick for a forward and has an excellent outside shot. There's no reason why he can't be one of the best NBA players for years to come, except for injuries which have plagued him recently.
