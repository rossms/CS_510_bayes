If you don't smoke, don't start, but.. These are great cigarettes if you do. They have a light, sweet taste that even a non-smoker would enjoy (if he were to foolishly start). I sometimes cough on other brands, but not on these; and I have smoked a pack a day of these for 10 years. Nothing satisfies a nicotine craving - or finishes a big meal - like the first, deep puff on a Marlboro Light. I know it's a light cigarette, but the nicotine hits you quick when you need it, which is good.
