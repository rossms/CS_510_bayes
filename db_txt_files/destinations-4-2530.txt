Not a place to stay if you are trying to get away from it all (go to Kauai), but a nice intro to the islands. For serious bodysurfers, go to Sandy Beach or Nakapuku (SP?) across from Sea Life Park- these are the most challenging body surfing beaches I have ever been too- but if you don't know what you are doing be careful.
