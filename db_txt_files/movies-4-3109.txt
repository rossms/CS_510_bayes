This was more like it. After the immensely disappointing Hannibal, I really wasn't expecting too much out of Red Dragon. However, I was quite impressed with the film. Norton was solid as usual, and Ralph Fiennes gave an eerie performance. Red Dragon effectively recaptures the lost glory of Silence of the Lambs and the character of Hannibal Lector. Overall, it is an exciting and suspenseful thriller that holds the viewer's attention throughout the film all the way to the explosive ending that brings the film to a satisfying close.
