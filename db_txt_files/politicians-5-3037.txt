Here! Here! Was there anyone as entertaining in office as Clinton? Seriously, he reminds me a bit of Carter, as he'll truly be more recognized after his presidency. But I really believe Clinton cared for the American people. Yes, he may not have had the best common sense at times; but the White House hasn't been the same since he left. Inasmuch as Gearge W is trying SO HARD to leave a legacy, Clinton will leave him in the dust hand down!
