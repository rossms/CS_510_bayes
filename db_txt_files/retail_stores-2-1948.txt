Out of necessity, I sometimes have to go to this pit because the wife feels ill (being married to me might accelerate the process) and I always notice two things: (1) the place is run by underpaid zombies who know nothing and (2) the shoppers are slow and dumb and prevent you from escaping the place in under 15-20 minutes. . .it's like time slows down in CVS. . .
