I really do like Target. I used to live near one, and they were much better than Wal-Mart or K-Mart! I like how clean they are, and their products, too. Plus, my best friend found the cutest fake leather jacket there for 19.99, and it looks so real that my mom was fooled, and my mom owns a real leather coat! Target is great! :)
