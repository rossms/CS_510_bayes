The ten year old Islay Malt is like Woody Allen, you'll either love it or hate it. The reason I love it is it has a honeyed sweetness on the palate and is complemented with a peppery finish. This briny scented gem is full - bodied and unapologetic in its straightforward approach. Reminiscent of the sea as your nose and palate are bombarded with seaweed and peat. It's a feral whiskey with no hope of being tamed. Age rounds this spirit, softening it while capturing its essence.
