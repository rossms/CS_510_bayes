I shop at Talbots for most of my professional wardrobe. I absolutely do not agree that the clothing is matronly. It is tailored and a can be a little pricey if you are trying to put 3 or 4 pieces together, but well worth it because you can wear it for years. I always get compliments on my new outfits each season. So it is a winner and the twice a year sales are worth waiting for.
