First of all, Stan Heath does not deserve the credit for his one successful season at Kent State. Gary Waters(now at Rutgers) built that program posting a 70-25 record in his last 3 years there, leaving Heath with a very athletic roster. Needless to say, Heath hasn't turned many heads at Ark when you consider the talented roster he has there.
