I've loved Beatrix Potters stories from when I was 3. I'm 14 now, and I still ove them. My Grandmother Bought the whole seires for me to read and she also purchased as many videos of it as she could. I love the tale of samuel whiskes or the rolly polly pudding the best! Before every video it shows Beatrix painting the aniamls out in the local wildlife. She was such a good artist and writer, I wish I had met her. These books are enchanted with life and i'm sure anyone would enjoy reading them! Thankyou!
