I've drank Don Q Crystal with Mr. Serralles himself (the NICEST folks you could ever meet, by the way) and I don't even like rum! THE best, bar none. With coke, with water. or straight up. No hangover, absoloutly quality liquor. Anything less, and you're just kidding yourself! Dont even consider anything less. -Wakula (thanks Felix!)
