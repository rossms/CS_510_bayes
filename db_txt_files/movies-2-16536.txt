I don't see what is so good about this movie. It only showed me how petty some people can be. But I did enjoy it when ice cube yanked the hose off that acetylene cylinder (sarcasm). Releasing the gas into a large, toxic and highly flammable cloud. I thought that I should add that you can't remove a hose from a gas cylinder without a wrench. And if you remove the hose while the gas is on then the escaping gas tends to make a loud hissing noise.
