A must see, as others have said, but it is so massive that you will do yourself a huge disfavor if you don't allow two, maybe three days to see it. Even three days isn't enough to see all of it, but you'll probably be able to see most of what interests you, specifically. The Egyption exhibits are extensive and fairly comprehensive, as London was a major backer for early excavation expeditions. You can also see the reliefs from the Parthenon made from casts taken before they started to deteriorate so badly. Don't miss this museum, you'll regret it!!!
