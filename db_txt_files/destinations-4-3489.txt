An interesting town with an English accent. Stay at the Empress if you can--one of the greatest historic hotels in Canada. I will say that if you approach Victoria by ferry from the US, you'll catch a glimpse of some of the best coastal scenery on the West Coast. Do try to see some of Vancouver Island. The strongest memory I have of the area is seeing virgin rain forests with the largest trees you'll ever see.
