The guy is only human. He is basically automatic as a closer and previously as a set-up man for the Yankees. The known notion is that when Mariano enters the game, it is all but over. I was heartbroken to see the final inning of game 7 of the world series this past year, but I still would trust Rivera in any pressure situation over any closer in baseball history. He has an amazing playoff ERA and is probably the greatest clutch closer in the history of the game. I am extremely proud to have him on my favorite team.
