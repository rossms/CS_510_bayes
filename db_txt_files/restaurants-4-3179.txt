I went to the original Uno in downtown Chicago. The toppings, cheese and sauce were really good. However, the crust is a lot like bisquick. The service has much to be desired, though. Also, you have to wait about a half hour to be seated and another 15-30 minutes for your pizza. It is worth the wait, though!
