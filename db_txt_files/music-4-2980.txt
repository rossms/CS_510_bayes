The only reason I give 4, not 5 stars, is knowing the Beatles history, you can hear the tension a bit in this less than group effort. It's sad to be reminded of this extreamly productive relationship slipping away. The music, however, is great, (with some filler sure), but still terrific. Harrison's While my Guitar... is a real stand out! Ya GEORGE!!!
