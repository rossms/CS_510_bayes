AK-47 rocks my socks. The man is Mr. Everything. Too bad he got injured and was out for most of the season because the man can play. He really does everything, blocks, defense, shoots, dunks, passes, rebounds. The man can play and he doesn't act like your average professional sports star which I love. Watch out, because next year the AK-47 is headed straight for the front lines of professional sports stardom.
