I've had my arctic cat 650LE for a few weeks now. Over all it is a good ATV. I'm having to take it back to the shop now since the front Diff. is leaking. I also puctured through the inside of the rim while out riding last weekend. The rims are very cheap. I would recomend ITP wheels to go on it. But other than that the Cat is a nice machine. Also everyone should have a dynomax ignition module on there machine.
