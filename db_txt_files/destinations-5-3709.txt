DENVER! What more can you say about a city like this. This is the new City. Not a Chicago, yet, but definitely gives Atlanta, Houston, San Diego, and Seattle a run for thier money. It's a young city that relies on what it actually has and not propaganda. Denver is beautiful and rich and apologizes for nothing.
