I love the way Madonna reinvents herself. I think she is confident enough to be willing to show all her interests and not just stick to one side of herself. I applaud Madonna for showing people that we can be many things and not just one sided beings! I have to admit I was taken by suprise with the cowgirl side of her, but the music and video works for me. I like the toned down version as much as her flashy ones. If you haven't peeped this one, I suggestyou do if you want to see yet another page of Madonna.
