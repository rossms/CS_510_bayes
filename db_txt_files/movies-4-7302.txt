I will always laugh out loud at the Baby Ruth in the pool, Rodney Dangerfield dancing around the golf course and the antics of Spalding. Ted Knight delivers a career performance. I guess there is not too much to measure his career by unless you count Mary Tyler Moore and his scenes with Monroe in 'Too Close for Comfort'.
