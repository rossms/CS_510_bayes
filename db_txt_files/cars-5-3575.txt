I have never had a problem in my 4 years of owning my car. It is the best car I have ever driven and is great for cruising around. Plus it has plenty of room for all my friends and the numerous trips carrying items to and from college (Wisconsin to Florida).I have over 100,000 and still running like a dream. Great for the winter too.
