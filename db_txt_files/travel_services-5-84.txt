Great business model, and much better managed than the traditional giants. I love being able to fly direct instead of having a half day's vacation wasted both ways by silly layovers and long delays. Southwest has pioneered flying convenience at reasonable prices, eliminating all the greedy pricing games that competitors have long played.
