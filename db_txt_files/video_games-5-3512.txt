Good gameplay. Incredible graphics, soundtrack, and unforgettable story. The characters seem real and have personality. Many hours of gameplay, it's challenging, and it is worth the time and money spent for the 4 CD set. One of my favorite role playing games of all time. It is hard to think of what will come next of the Final Fantasy series.
