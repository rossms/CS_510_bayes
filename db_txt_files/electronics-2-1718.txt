This VCR slv-478 is one of the most difficult pieces of equipment my husband and I have ever tried to use. We have to use the printed guide every time; and if we manage to get the programming, it doesn't always work. We'd pitch this one and get another, but it seems wise to wait to buy a DVD. It certainly won't be a Sony though.
