I used to like John Chaney. His teams were relatively successful (though in a relatively weak conference), he emphasized defense, and he recruited a lot of troubled kids. What turned me against him was when he literally threatened to have an opposing coach killed after a tough loss. I only saw this aired once, but I never saw the press conference shown again (eg on Sportscenter). That made me wonder if the press tiptoes around Cheney due to his racial positions.
