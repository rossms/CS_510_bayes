I moved to Richmond from Northern Virginal 15 years ago and I still hate it. (Wife wont ever leave, another annoying Richmond trait) It is not a city, but a large town. The city has tremendous potential, but the city council is a 12 ring circus. The citizens suffer from delusions of grandeur, unaware that they live in a cultural void. The DC metro area (except traffic & real estate prices) is a much better place. Richmond: If it ain't broke, don't fix it
