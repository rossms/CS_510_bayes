I only comment on vehicles I've personally owned! I have a 1991 Honda Accord with 256,000 miles on it. It passes emissions with flying colors and has no problems. I make regular trips between Seattle and Spokane and drive long distances on the freeway in Seattle. In three years I've only purchased a water pump and a battery.
