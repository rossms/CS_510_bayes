Jennifer Aniston cut her hair and in season seven she looks so young and cute. Now that she is in her thirties and married, I hope that she will sign for two more years with Friends. I think she will probably keep an active career but her husband and perhaps future children may take most of her time. I think being married to Brad Pitt would take a lot of time and energy. Season eight on friends looks to be a good one for Rachel. I hope the grand finale of Friends will have Rachel together with Ross.
