I'm 14 years old, me and my buddys chew, it was ussualy only the stuff we could steal from are dads, then we found a store that would sell it to us, and since then I have trydprobably 10 different kinds of chew Levi Garret and Redman are by far the best. I prefer Levi because it has better leavse and taste and don't fall apart when you chew it, Redman has to many little bits and thin leavesso it kinda falls apart when you chew it, but it is still a good chew!
