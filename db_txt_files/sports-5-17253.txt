Jealousy is the reason that people hate the Cowboys. Every team goes through hard times, but to ridicule this team as some people do is ridiculous. This team could have won 6 superbowls in the 90's and people would still say they are not that good. When will it stop? I know, when All Eagles fans decide to go back to school and learn their ABC's, cause they are the biggest cry babies in Pro Sports.
