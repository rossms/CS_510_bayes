These frozen dishes are actually really good considering they are nothing more than glorified tv dinners. If you eat a tv dinner on occasion...I would highly recommend this brand. HOWEVER...Marie Callender products tend to be very high in fat...so be on the lookout for that if you are watching fat content. Very good...
