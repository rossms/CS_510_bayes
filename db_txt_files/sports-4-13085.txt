I would love for Texas A M to be one of the top 5 teams in the nation, but I don't see that anytime in the forseeable future. I was sad to see RC go and the way that Franchione handled his 'Bama players when he left. Hopefully, they can win 8 or 9 games next year, then really start assaulting the top 10.
