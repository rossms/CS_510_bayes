I really liked Sleepless in Seattle it is a sweet and romantic movie. Sam and Annie are meant for each other but they have never met. Annie is engaged to a man named Walter. The movie keeps you hanging on to the end to see if they will ever meet each other. I think that Meg Ryan and Tom Hanks did a good job at playing their roles.
