I love London. It's got great attractions (Big Ben, Tower of London), great theater for reasonable prices, cool pubs, and the Underground which is simple to use and can take you all over the city. Sure, the food isn't the best, but at least everyone speaks English which makes getting around that much easier. For something different, be sure to check out Speaker's corner in Hyde Park on Sundays.
