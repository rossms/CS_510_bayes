Ah the Minnesota Vikings. So much talent, yet they always come up short. DO they choke under pressure? Get too cocky? Injury plagued but not revealing it? My guess would be a little of everything. Tough to say where they'll go this year. However, since the Vikes bring me such good memories of my dad I have to rate them a 5, he'd roll in his grave otherwise.
