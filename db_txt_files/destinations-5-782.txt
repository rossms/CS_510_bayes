Yeah we need to maybe need to get rid of Queen but this is still great place to live as is our American nieghbors place, down south. If we are so 'political correct', how come we have produced some of the best comedians. I've always felt it was a little over-rated and fake-rebellious to be 'politically incorrect' anyways (Woooo! Who cares!). But hey, BC is beautiful. Montreal and Vancouver are the best cities.
