I really was expecting more when I rented this movie. Most of my buds at school said that they liked it, so I thought that I'd give a shot. What a letdown! I think Adam Sandler is the coolest, and I thought that he was great in Happy Gillmore and Big Daddy , but this movie just didn't do it for me. I chuckled a few times, but it just seemed to be lacking that special ingrediant that is needed to make an Adam Sandler movie a good one. A couple of funny jokes, but trust me, it definately was not worth renting.
