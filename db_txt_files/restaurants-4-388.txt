Has to be considered one of the best overall major burger chains. The restaurants tend to be fairly clean, the meals are good, and it's hard to top their shakes. On the downside, they don't cater to smaller communities ( 20,000) as McDonald's and Burger King do, and they're considerably pricier than the former two, but at least in this instance the good outweighs the bad.
