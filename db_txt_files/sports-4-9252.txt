Talk about rejuvenating a career - Camby is having a great run out in Denver. He is a game changer on defense - the only guy in the league that can make KG work to get off a shot, and is a nice passer out of the high post. When you consider his freakish athleticism and length and the fact that he doesn't care if he gets 20 shots a game, Camby is a big piece of what they're trying to do up in Denver. Amazingly, since he's been in Denver, Camby has not really lived up to the Mr. Glass fragility that he showed in New York.
