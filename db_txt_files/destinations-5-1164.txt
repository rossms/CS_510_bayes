I lived here as a young man and recently spent nine years working with the Dutch. The most mature minded people on the planet. The country is now really overcrowded, 25% of the population is foreign born. This is putting pressure on Holland's liberties that they have acquired over centuries. But if you want your mind broadened, come here.
