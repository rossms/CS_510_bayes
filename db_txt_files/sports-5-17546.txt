I'm not that into football but the Raiders are my favorite team because they're controversial. I watched a game a few weeks back and, even though I barely comprehended the objective of the game, it was amusing because they played on a wet field and they splashed everytime they tackled! It was hilarious. Also, they won so that's good.
