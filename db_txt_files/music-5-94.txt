An album with some really great tunes! I enjoy every track, except for maybe The Sidewinder Sleeps Tonight (I could just never really get into it). R.E.M. does such a fabulous job of writing meaningful songs from the heart, never sounding phony or sacharine. I remember listening to Man in the Moon on lonely days back when I was in middle school and how it used to make me feel a bit better. The arrangements on all the songs are rich and warm. Mandolins, cellos, violins and violas are used liberally to deepen the sound of the core group and create music that pleases and speaks to the listener.
