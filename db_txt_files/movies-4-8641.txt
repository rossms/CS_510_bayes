This movie is a classic. I guess it is one of those movies you have to relax and watch to find the humor of it funny. I like watching John Candy's quarrels with Archie the dog, and the rich snob who was played by the late Richard Crenna. Nobody could have done a better job than Richard Crenna playing the rich snob. I like his lines like: "Is this your wife?" or "Are these your shorts?" Since i'm young, this is the first movie i seen with Rip Torn. I know he has been acting for years, but his role in this movie is one that will always be most reminded for me.
