My wife and I stayed at Club St. Lucia. Great value. Excellent food. Nice beach with three pools on the property. However, Scuba St. Lucia plays a trick on divers and makes a last minute requirement (once you are on the boat) that you make a shore dive on your first day with them (to check you out) and only then on successive days can you make dives with them. Also read the disclaimer contract carefully, they admit to being negligent (and ask that you excuse them).
