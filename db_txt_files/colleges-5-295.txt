Keller is a great school. Its a bit on the pricey side but what quality school isn't. Keller reminds me of a trade school. I say that because they provide you with tools to attack business and technical problems that arrive in the workplace. We study real problems with real professionals, not professors who just read about something in a journal. Great school for working professionals. I guarantee you'll be able to use something from each class at your workplace.
