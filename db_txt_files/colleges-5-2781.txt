ACU is an experience that will change your life. With a 19:1 student-to-faculty ratio, you get personal attention. Have you heard of Max Lucado (Christian author), Royce Caldwell (Pres. of Southwestern Bell), Lance Barrow (CBS Sports Producer)? They chose ACU and it paved their future. I'll always be indebted to ACU for instilling in me the drive to change the world.
