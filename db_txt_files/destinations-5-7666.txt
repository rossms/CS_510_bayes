If you're fortunate enough to be in the area, this is an equally WONDERFUL place for a family day-trip OR for a relaxed date! There's so much to see inside and out - without being any more expensive than you're comfortable with. Spring through Fall in nice weather you can sit out and enjoy the entertainment - don't forget to bring a few dollars to toss in the entertainers hats! Nice atmosphere to talk and interact with lots to see. Take advantage of it if you can!
