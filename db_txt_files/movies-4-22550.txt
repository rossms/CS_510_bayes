Tim Burton's adaptation of the classic comic, revives some hope for the comic book to movie genre. He completely captures the image of the brooding dark knight on a mission for justice. No film can succeed if it remains 100% accurate to the comic but Burton keeps the important aspects of the legend alive changing more trivial things like costumes to make a quality film.
