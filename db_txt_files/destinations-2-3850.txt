Edmonton was a huge disappointment. It seemed very poorly kept for the most part. The roads were really bad and the whole city had a dirty look about it. The Mall was a bit of a disappointment too, but was still the highlight of the trip. It was unclean, like the rest of the city, and the people were real jerks, as they were everywhere else as well. I don't think I'll come back to Edmonton, once was enough.
