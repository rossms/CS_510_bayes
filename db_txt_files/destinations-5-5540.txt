I've never had the privlege of visiting this beautiful state, but after reading the comments would like to pack up and go there now. Out of 30-40 comments -only a couple rated lower than a three. Moreover, the fact that the ocean and mountains are within a two hour drive combined with four seasons and beautiful scenery...with NICE people...yes...I could do this.
