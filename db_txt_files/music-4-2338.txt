It is very cool to see Zoegirl reaching out to young girls with their songs, yet by this time they have reached the point of repeating the same themes that made up their other cds. Yes being a guy doesn't help matters, but I liked their old cds in spite of the girl- themed topics. This one feels repetitive compared to former cds. 'Dead Serious' has a laugh-out-loud sound to it, but again, lyrics are about the same as before - repairing broken hearts, trusting God to make it better and restore your guy, etc,etc. It gets old. Still, if you are new to Zoegirl or don't mind the lyrics, this will do just fine.
