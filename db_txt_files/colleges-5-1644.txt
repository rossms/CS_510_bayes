As a student in the School of Foreign Service, I deeply appreciate Georgetown's reputation as the premier Catholic research institution in the world. Also, studying in the most prestigious undergraduate school of diplomacy and international law in the world, I know that I am prepared to be more than a global citizen, I have the potential to be a global leader.
