Having finally had the time to actually PLAY the game, I must say, I was not let down. This is the closest to a real AD D game as I have ever played (and I am a D Der from WAAAAAAY back). The interactions of the characters, and the possible twists along the way are outstanding. There are enough side tracks and missions in the game, you begin to forget that there is a singular, pre-defined mission you have to complete!
