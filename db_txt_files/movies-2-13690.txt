Robin Williams has put in some great turns but he should stay away from over-sentimental dreck like this, a sort of modern update on 'Goodbye Mr Chips'. At my school there were teachers who tried to ingratiate themselves with certain pupils, but were generally laughing stocks and not heroic figures. The plot doesn't ring true for me.
