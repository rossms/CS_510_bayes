Coach Fulmer seemes to forget that if he is a no show to SEC Media Days, his University gets no Coaching representation. And that is really sad for the University of Tennessee. Maybe Fulmer should pay the $10,000.00 SEC fee (for not showing up) instead of UT having to foot the bill. Coach Fulmer; you will be perfectly safe at SEC Media days. Citizens of Alabama have no need, nor desire to say or do anything to you. Sorry for you, if you don't show up. In the long run and in the annals of history it will be your loss.
