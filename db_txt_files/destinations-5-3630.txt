San Antonio is probably the best city in all of Texas, but I can't say that for sure as I haven't been to them all. Alot of people told me how boring the Alamo was, but I really enjoyed it ! I could just feel the history in the air when I was there, I absolutely loved it. And the Riverwalk was totally awesome. I was also surprised by the genuine friendliness of the people of San Antonio, such nice people. I would definately go there again, a great city with great people. Texas should be proud...
