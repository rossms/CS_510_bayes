This CD is great because it allows big time Metallica fans to enjoy some old school Metallica. And what's great about the CD is that real fans can hear the development of the group because the songs sound like certain other CD's. Some songs are similar to Ride the Lightning while others resemble And Justice for All . Metallica Rules!
