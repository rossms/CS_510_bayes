Downstate Illinois is underrated, size isn't everything. I'm from Chicago and I'm secure enough to say the cities of Peoria, Springfield, Bloomington, and Champaign-Urbana are wonderful and beat Chicago's sprawling suburbia by a long shot. Southern Illinois is also very beautiful and green, with lush forests and hills, a break from the corn fields.
