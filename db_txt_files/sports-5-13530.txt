I vote for him as the sexiest man alive. I watched the entire superbowl in hopeful anticipation that they would show him, his beautiful face, soft blue sparkling eyes and soft lips that I hope he'll lick at any moment. And add to that his accomplishments! Gruden 2003 meets Gruden 2002 in the Superbowl...what else needs to be said?
