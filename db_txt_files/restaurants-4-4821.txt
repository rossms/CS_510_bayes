Three words: bottomless coffee pot. Great for us college types who have a ton of studying to do, and good food to boot. I have enjoyed a Denver omelete once every couple of months (budgetary constraints) without fail, and it's so big, I have to make a second meal out of it back at home. I also catch a pork chop dinner there from time to time, and those chops melt like butter. Easily cut with a fork and moist clean through. The price isn't too bad, either, for how much you get. :)
