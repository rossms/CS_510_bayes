this is a pretty funny movie. A little boy accidentally gets left behind at the Holidays. He must defend his house from two bungling burglers. Macauley Culkin was great as Kevin. the only thing i really do not like is this movie gets quite violent with the burglers when you think about what would really happen to someone if they got the injuries the burglers did in the movie.but a pretty good movie for the most part.
