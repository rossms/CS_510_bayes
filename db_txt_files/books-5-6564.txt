Couldn't put these books down. I read the entire series in 2 weeks. I felt like I knew the characters by the time I was finished and I didn't want to let them go. Mr. Stanek does a wonderful job with an economy of words. I would recommend it to anyone looking for a good series - and strongly suggest that all fantasy fans give them a read.
