This is Limp Bizkit's first and best album ever. This album made me a fan for life. The guitar is awesome, the music is fast, the lyrics are great. Every single song is one that will be playing over and over in your head for weeks. This album has the best composition I have seen in a long time. Fred's voice shows all of his emotion. Even though they've released new albums, this one is number one on my list.
