Here's a man that should have been a 2-term President (right now) if the Dem Party has any kind of backbone. Even sports stars didn't support him -- and now the Dem candidate has a wife born & raised in racial segregation and Apartheid... Shame on the Dem Party for depriving us of an intelligent, focused and authentic leader.
