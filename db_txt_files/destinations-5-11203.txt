The Travel Channel did a one-hour program on water parks in America, and this place rated No. 1 for a good reason. It has a large assortment of rides located in three separate areas. One of their areas is geared toward young children, while another is for older teenagers and adults. They have three nice facilities to stay on the grounds of the complex. What is really unique about this place is that the water comes from the nearby Comal River. A nice place, to say the least.
