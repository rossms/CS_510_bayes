Well-done for not having any sound. Lon Chaney's good- the scene you might recognize from this one is when Christine (Mary Philbin) unmasks the phantom when he's playing the organ, and he gets up and towers over her and the picture gets all fuzzy. Every version of Phantom seems to be different- sometimes his name is Erik, sometimes he's just The Phantom, and the last scene in this movie is different from every other rendition I've seen or heard.
