LP is one of my favorite groups,and this cd is truly amazing!i mean,when u first listen to it,u hear the lyrics being rapped out by mike,and then you hear chester singing his heart out (and his voice is very strong might i add),and u might be confused at first,but when you listen to it all i gaurentee you'll absolutley LOVE it!!every song deals with tough topics--for instance,isolation--and has great guitar playing,all except cure for the itch ,wich is a fun little song only with music.and for all you teeny-boppers out there....the guys in Linkin Park are sooooo sexy....ohhh yeah baby!!lol
