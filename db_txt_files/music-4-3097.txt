Oh Grandpa Grunge has struck! Such a good record. I remember pulling this out form my parents' record collectiom amd listening and loving it way before I knew anything about music. That says a mouthful and a half about this collection of songs. I was some unknowing kid and still liked listening and flipping over the vinyl to find out what was on the other side.
