This is one of those books that hung on to the NYT best seller list and I can't understand why. Not especially well written, not interesting, not even a particularly sympathetic plot. Perhaps women read this book to feel better about their own lives. (The this would never happen to me school of thought.) Beyond that, I can't see the allure.
