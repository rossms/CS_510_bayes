LT is a one of the best backs in the NFL but this hes the greatest simply is not true. Look at Alexander in Seattle for the best this year and his career vs. LT. Head to head they are very close but Shawn has the edge. He is leading with 214 more yards this year and right at 250 more in his career with 5 more touches than LT. He has more 20+, TD, FD and longer runs and believe it or not has a higher average per catch, even though LT is thrown the ball so much more (what other weapons has SD had). So overall, right now, Alexander is the man.
