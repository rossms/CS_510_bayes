Probably one of the Hardest of Hard albums (or CDs,for you youngins').Blistering and Brilliant.Anselmos growl never sounded better.I've said it before,but it bears repeating-these guys played TIGHT!!! This is their strongest album.If you can only afford ONE Pantera CD-this is the one.There is little or no filler here.Ever song is well crafted and executed with guillotine precision.Raw Power!
