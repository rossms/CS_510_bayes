His perfect game on May 17, 1998 is a classic performance, giving the Yankees a 4-0 win over the Twins. I'll always remember Paul O'Neill charging in from right field to make the game-ending catch. He had 17 strikeouts that game. Boomer is great because he has such a free spirit and really doesn't care what anyone thinks about him. I am very happy to have him back on the Yanks and know that he will do well and further define their pitching staff as the best in the league.
