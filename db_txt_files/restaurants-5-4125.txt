Texas Roadhouse definately deserves its high place on this list. Ever since I first went to one of these restaurants a few years ago, I have always considered it to be my favorite place to go for a good steak. Every time that I have been, the food has been cooked just right and the server's are friendly. There is usually a wait to get in, espescially on Friday and Saturday nights, but its well worth it!
