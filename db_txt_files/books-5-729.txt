A hilariously funny and entertaining story from start to finish. An extremely intellegent child who has special powers is repeatedly neglected by her parents, she finds comfort in reading and studying. She uses her special powers to heal her own wounds and those of her sweet schoolteacher, Miss Honey. It is definately appealing to children, making adults out to be the rotton ones (something that most kids would agree with). I certainly suggest that everyone read this novel at least once in thier life.
