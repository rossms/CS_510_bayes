This product is one of a kind. Other companies make mp3 players but none compare to the Apple ipod. It holds so much music, more than the average person has, and its a great place to store music rather than the edgy harddrive of a pc. Everything is designed near perfect on this product, the only downside is the price. But, I found an awesome place to get mine for free. I thought it was a joke but it's real, just check this out and see for yaself. http://GetiPod4Free.com/index.php?referral=3509
