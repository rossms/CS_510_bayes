Although not spectuacular or over-the-top, the movie was surprisingly good. For one, it had good acting from Jack Black (whom I had never seen in a movie before now) and the children. Also, Joan Cusack was great as the uptight principal. The jokes were funny, and the ending was great and upbeat. Profanity was minor, and not used, really, in a bad sense. Also, references to some bands that I enjoy (such as Yes) provoked a smile or two.
