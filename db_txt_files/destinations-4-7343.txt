At the risk of sounding flippant, Innsbruck is a nice town to pass through when you're driving from northern Italy to someplace like Garmisch or Oberammergau. It looks nice from the road that overlooks it. In fairness to Innnsbruck, I never did spend much time in the town itself, but what I did see was clean and attractive.
