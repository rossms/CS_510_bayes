Manning is red hot. Any other year and I might pick them to make the Super Bowl. That could still happen but the great teams anyone from the AFC needs to beat to make it there is unbelievable. The NCF should be thankful they only have to face the eventual winner. Not that the NCF team will win but it's better to only face one great team to win it all than face one very playoff round.
