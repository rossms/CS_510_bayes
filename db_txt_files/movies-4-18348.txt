Not too bad, not too bad at all! Probably average for Tim Burton, the modern-day equivelant to Tod Browning. I like how it had the feel and the atmosphere of the best Universal horror movies, particularly Frankenstein. Depp gives a decent performance while Richi slides into her role perfectly. As I said before, not bad at all.
