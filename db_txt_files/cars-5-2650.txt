The Nissan Skyline is one of the best cars ever to come out of Japan. Not only does it dominate on the road course, but there is hardly a better drift car out there. The only downside is if you do manage to get your hands on one in the USA, good luck gettin through the Drive-Through with that Right Hand Drive.
