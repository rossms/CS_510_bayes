AS RON FRANKLIN OF ESPN AND MIKE GOTTFRIED SAID....IF YOU WANT TO KNOW HOW A COACH IS DOING LOOK AT THE REPORT CARD-----THE RECORD! FULMER HAS A WINNIING PERCENTAGE BETTER AND HIGHER THAN THE BEAR OR THE GENERAL. HE IS OBVIOUSLY GREAT WHEN YOU CONSIDER HE IS ALSO IN THE TOUGH SEC. HE WILL GO DOWN AS A GREAT COACH ALONG WITH LOMBARDI AND ROCKNE!
