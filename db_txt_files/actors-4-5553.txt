It's easy to make fun of Marky Mark, no doubt about it, but he's a surprisingly good actor. He was perfect for the lead role in Boogie Nights, and I liked him in Three Kings, too. He also did a really good job in a less-well-known role in The Basketball Diaries, as Leonardo DiCaprio's drug-addled buddy. In most movies, there's just something kind of goofy and likeable about him, but he's shown that he can also play serious bad guys. I think Mark Wahlberg has a good career in front of him, and I'm looking forward to seeing The Perfect Storm.
