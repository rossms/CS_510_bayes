This is the result if a movie is far more popular than its creators originally though and decide to bolt on a sequel. I went to see this with high expectations and was very dissapointed. The creators of this have tried to stick far too much pseudo philospohical cogitation into the film at the expense of the plot. I enjoy films that have big ideas as long as the ideas are integrated into the plot and above all the film is entertaining. If I need a lecture on the philosophical nature of choice than I'll go to a lecture. If I wan't an entertaining film than I'll steer clear of the Matrix reloaded.
