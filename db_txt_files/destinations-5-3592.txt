It's a different destination in the winter. But in the summer, the Twin Cities are full of great things to do. More people patronize local theater here than anywhere else in the United States (per capita), evidence that Minneapolis and St. Paul have a great cultural scene. The air is clean, the city is nice and safe, and the surrounding state is beautiful. What's not to like?
