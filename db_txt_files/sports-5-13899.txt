I remember vividly the first time I saw Payton in person (opening day v. Detroit 1977, on his way to nearly 1900 yards that year). He personified class throughout his career. His best play ever was a block he threw against a blitzing linebacker that gave McMahon time to hit Gault for a bomb which triggered a comeback vs the Vikes to keep the Bears undefeated in the '85-86 season. So versatile, so powerful, such a team player. He'll be very missed.
