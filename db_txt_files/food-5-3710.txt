If high sales mean anything, this was THE GS cookie of choice back when I was hawking them as a 10 year old girl scout. I remember selling more of them than any other type. No doubt they are still widely supported by the peanut butter addicted. Though I can no longer personally comment on the sales, I think Do-si-dos have held up pretty well over the years in spite of the expanded GS cookie line. I know I still like them, though I have to admit my favorite is now that coconut, chocolate and caramel bit o' heaven the Samoa!
