You have to love what St. Joseph's is doing this year. For those of you not familiar with the program, St. Joe's is a tiny, local school in Philly, with an unexpectedly rich basketball tradition. That they have been able to run the table thus far is shocking - especially when you consider that they simply don't attract blue chip recruits. They have not just beaten teams this year - they have trounced them. And good teams. Lead by the best back court in America, they have beaten teams like Gonzaga, Cal, Villanova, Temple, Dayton, BC, etc. Maybe the best story in College Basketball in the last decade.
