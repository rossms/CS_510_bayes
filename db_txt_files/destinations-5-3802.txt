NAshville is an Amazing city. Tons of history and plenty of entertainment. The people are educated your just retarded and stay around the tourist ABBAfan5. And another thing, DISCO IS OVER THAK GOD!! ABBA SUX!!! I dont like country music eiter. Nasvhille has way more than coutry singers. The Interstates are conjest all the time because of the construction and youcant even compare it to a Washington, L.A. or New York. I cant just be mee that like it as it is the 8 most visited place IN THE WORLD, and is the 12 fastest growing city IN THE U.S. You will love it!!!!!
