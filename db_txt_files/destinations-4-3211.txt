Very beautiful city, with a nice oceanfront, some gorgeous scenery, one of the best zoos in the country, and lots to do. The weather is fantastic. My only concern about the place is that it is slowly becoming another Los Angeles. The sprawl is catching up to it. The city doesn't have the smog or the incredible traffic problems of Los Angeles yet, but they really need to get a hold on the sprawl now, before it turns into that much less interesting city. But I think of the big three - San Francisco, Los Angeles, and San Diego - San Diego is clearly the most liveable and most interesting.
