I am the original owner and have over 171,000 miles on a 1987 Camry. It runs great, thank God. It gives exceptional performance for a 4 cyclinder sedan and gets up to 36 MPG on the highway with an average of 32 -33 on combination city and highway driving. It is a LOW maintence vehicle. If the new ones are as good as this 87, I would without a doubt purchase another Camry. It has never been off the road for repairs/maintence for over 8 hours and rarely needs any kind of repair. It is a true breed work horse with comfort. I hope Toyota keeps up the tradition of building such cars.
