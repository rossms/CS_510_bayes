I've always loved those little duds! Nice and chewy with a great flavor combination. Along with Zero bars, Snickers and Sweet Tarts these were also high on my childhood list of candy purchases. As I grew older, I did sometimes wonder if their extreme chewy-ness might actually be strong enough to pull fillings out of my teeth or even a tooth out of my gums. I'm sure I was a happier person before I had to start worrying about such things.
