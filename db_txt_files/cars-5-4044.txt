I had my SaFe since Labor Day Weekend. I had one small problem w/the belt. It was replaced. I really love it. So what if it is not the fastest vehicle to 60 MPH. The ride is great and is quiet. I almost went to sleep while driving the SaFe to Brownsville, TX because the ride was so smooth. Texas Santa Fe who lives by the shores of Lake Grapevine
