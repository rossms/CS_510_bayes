My favoutite city. I visit Toronto every opportunity I get. The people are really friendly and there is always a lot going on. It's got great concert and sports venues and lots of great restaurants and bars. The shopping is good and the PATH that runs under the city is awesome. I don't see how anyone could ever be bored in Toronto. Wonderful place.
