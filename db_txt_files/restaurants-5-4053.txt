I love restaurants with the novelty of a Japanese hibachi grill at your table. Every chef I've encountered at the chain has been artfully dexterous and delightful to watch prepare food. The food is very salty, but pleasing. This isn't the place for when you want an intimate date, as it can get loud at your eight person table. Instead, it is a lively place to take a group of friends for a change of pace.
