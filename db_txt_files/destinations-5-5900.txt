New Jersey is filled with great people, places, and surrondings, all you have to do is look in the right places. New Jersey has been rated the 11th healthiest state to live in, the 6th wealthiest state in the U.S, and has an excellent education record for which it is highly praised for. Are there bad parts in Jersey? Yeah, like Elizabeth, Trenton, Newark, Jersey City, etc., but no other state doesn't have the same problem.
