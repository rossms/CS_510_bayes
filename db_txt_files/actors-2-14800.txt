okay i'll admit, i think she has decent acting skills. but her music is really lame and so are her looks. i don't understand how people think she's so beautiful. nevertheless she thinks she's a lot prettier than she really is and she's constantly strutting around like she's freaking aphrodite or something. face it, the woman craves LOTS AND LOTS of attention and stops at almost nothing to get it.
