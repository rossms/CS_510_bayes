I love everything on the menu at popeyes! The red beans and rice are the best. Popeyes cajun gravy makes the potatoes awsome. My boys can't seem to get enough of the potatoes. We only eat at Popeyes when we are on the road for travel hockey. so its a real treat. I wish we had a popeyes here in south Ft. Myers Florida. Then again it might prove to be too much temtation. The weight thing , you know.
