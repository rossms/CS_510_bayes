I like his Fat Albert character, but I hate his stand-up. When the Cosby show came out when I was a kiddie, I thought it was unrealistic, and so sickening sweet that I thought that it would rot my teeth out. in my opinion, The Jefferson's, 227, Amen, sanford and Son, good times, and AMEn were much better.
