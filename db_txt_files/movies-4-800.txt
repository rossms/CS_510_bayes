Yes it had a few plot-holes (c'mon, doesn't Dr.Crowe ever think of starting a conversation with anyone other than the boy?), but the plot-holes doesn't matter. How else can they have a great ending twist? I think that The Sixth Sense, has great acting (Haley Joel Osment - the greatest child actor), and is a great thriller. Although I didn't find it that scary, it still makes you think. It was one of the best films from 1999, and is generally a good movie. Recommended. Summary: GREAT ACTING, GREAT TWIST, GREAT MOVIE.
