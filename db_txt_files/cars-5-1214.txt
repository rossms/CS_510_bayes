I have a 1998 Toyota Corolla LE. She is black, has an automatic transmission, and is fully loaded including a stock sunroof. I have had this car for quite a while now and haven't had ANYTHING go wrong with her. I'm actually in the process of modifying her to be a show/track car. My only discrepancies would be the ugly beige interior and the cup holders. There's no point in having them. EVERYTHING spills when you go around a turn.. no matter how slow you go, something will spill.
