Great selection, VERY helpful/friendly staff, incredible flavor that is usually reserved for the mom and pop places. Get the pulled pork/smoked sausage/brisket platter with baked beans and fries and rinse it down with an iced tea. I cant imagine rating another chain 5 stars as Ive never had ONE bad experience here, but MANY great experiences.
