Comes across as a self-important little snipe who, like his father before him, does angry really well. Though Douglas manages to pack a lot of macho energy into his performances, they are still sadly lacking in both depth and variety - he s been playing pretty close to the same character since The Streets of San Francisco . And from the shallow end of the rating criteria pool - he hasn t gotten any better looking either. For me his work rates down there with the most unmemorable stuff I have ever seen preserved on celluloid.
