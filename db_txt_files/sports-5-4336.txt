Roy Heel is by far the best coach & recruiter in CBB today.His coming back to UNC has enraged a lot of jealousy & at KU after he won the NCAA title in only his 2nd year.Duke should be trembling & lashing out because Royheel is gonna pay em back slowly & whip their tails year in & year out until Duke fades away as UNC's rival.I guess it will start being someone else the next 10 years.Royheel plays the best style of up tempo BB in the College game & is a silky smooth dresser.Get over it Dookies,Roy's here to stay & wait until you see that DYNASTY he's gonna have. 4 NCAA Titles in 5yrs. is in reach.
