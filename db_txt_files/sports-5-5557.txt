Raymond Felton has shown countless times that he is able to carry the team on his shoulders. He is the essential catalyst. For example, the Season Opener @Santa Clara was lost because of Ray's absence. Dukies have said that one player doesn't make or break a game, but sometimes one player can be the difference between an L and a W. He pushes the ball, and can cross anyone in the League, and then make a perfect pass. The only problem with him being so good is that he will move on to the NBA and wont stay to help us another year.
