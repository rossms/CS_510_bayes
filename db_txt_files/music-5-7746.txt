Rio was a groundbreaking video in the time when there were no music videos. The boat, the surf, the blowing wind... this video is what MTV was all about its first couple years of existence. Throw in I Want Candy by Bow Wow Wow, and that Blondie video with Fab Five Freddie and you have MTV's entire programming from 1984-1986.
