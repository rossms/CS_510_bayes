This is one of the best bagel shops I have ever been to. They have a nice selection of flavored cream cheeses- except not many light versions. They also have some funky flavored bagels you cant find anywhere else. I enjoy their Homestyle breakfast sandwiches with fresh squeezed orange juice a lot. Thier coffee isnt bad either. They seem to have some good lunch sandwiches on the menu, too, except I've never tried any. I think of bagels as a breakfast item.
