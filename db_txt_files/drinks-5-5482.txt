This will always be the best out of the lemon lime soft drinks. It tastes so great when it is ice cold and it is really hot outside. I love this stuff ! Cherry 7-Up is good, too. And not only that, but 7-Up has been known to get rid of a stomach ache occasionally. Just a wonderful all American tradition ! I recommend this soft drink to everyone !
