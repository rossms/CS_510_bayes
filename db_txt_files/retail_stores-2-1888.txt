I used to work at one of the 4 in Vegas. Its a nice place to work somewhat. The upper management are complete idiots and uncaring which makes me not recommend this store. They are a high fashion 99% clothes only store, so I dont recomend it for the boys. A lot of designer brands that are VERY expensive. But the pay is good.
