I recently flew on Allegiant Airlines from Madison, Wi to Orlando. They offer flights from many small U.S. airports to Las Vegas and Orlando-Sanford. The service was great, they have all leather seats, and the flight was a good price. They offer snacks for a small fee. Its no big deal just bring your own food and drinks or pay the small fee. The flight was also very early because once everyone is on board they take off as soon as possible. Please check this airline out or go to allegiantair.com
