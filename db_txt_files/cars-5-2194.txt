I've had my 70 240z for quite some time now it is the second one I've owned. The Z car is the most fun I've ever had with a car. Weight ratio is awesome! The modifications you can make to the car is endless. I think Porsche is going to be a little envious of the new Z. A new fully loadedZ is faster handles better and about $20k less than a base Boxter. All around I think the Z is THE best car!!!!
