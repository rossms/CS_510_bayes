Barry Bonds is the greatest thing that has happened to baseball over the past 25 years. No one has been better and more dominant than Barry Bonds. If you have not seen him in person then I highly recommend it that you go and watch this great legend on the field. He is going to be the future all time home run leader! Barry is the best player in baseball hands down. Those who gave him less than 5 stars are just haters. Don't hate the player, hate the game!
