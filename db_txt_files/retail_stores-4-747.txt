I find Old Navy generally fun to shop. There are usually some good bargains and I almost always find at least one (even basic) item I like. Some of the stuff is a little tacky, but the baby dept. is really cute and there are some good styles for men and women. The Old Navy in my local mall has deteriorated in customer service and the whole experience of visiting 'planet Old Navy' a bit, but I have been in some stores that are still fun, with nice salespeople, loud music, etc.
