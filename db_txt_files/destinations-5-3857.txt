Go to the festivals in Edmonton - especially the Fringe and the Jazz and Folk Festivals. Probably one of the pretiest cities there are in the summer. People are exceedingly friendly and helpful. The Mall is much more than a mall too - great place to go, lots to do for kids and recreation - especially if you have a cool or rainy day. An great theatre and state of the art concert hall ...it's really something! The Space and Science center is a must see and if you're a golfer - over 60 courses in the area for as little as $25 Canadian up to a maximum of $60 or so.
