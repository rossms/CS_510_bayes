The underaged #8, I don't so much care for. Daniels drinkers seem to like it a lot, but what does that say, exactly... But the #12... oh my. George Dickel #12 is truly an EXCEPTIONAL whisky for the very reasonable price charged. Very underappreciated, sans those in the know ... If it were more widely promoted/popular, I'm sure the price would rise, so, keep this secret find hush-hush.
