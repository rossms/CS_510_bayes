I can finally like Arkansas basketball. It's such a relief to get that racist jackass Nolan Richardson out of there. And to replace him with a great man like Stan Heath is an even better improvment than we all could have hoped for. He didn't do bad at all this past season with such a young team that he's had such little time to work with. The hogs should begin to dominate again in the next few years under his excellent coaching.
