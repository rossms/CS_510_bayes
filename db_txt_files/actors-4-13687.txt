Beautiful, elegent, stunning, talented. Sophie Marceau is the Catherine Denuve of the 90's and 00's. She always puts out quality work, she's always involved in good material(ok, maybe not her Hollybore work), and she has an astounding, earthy beauty that a Cow cud just fall hard for. She's got it all! :=8D
