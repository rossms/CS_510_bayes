Best fast food place ever! This chain is mostly limited to Southern California and some other small places. Look, if you ever come out this way you MUST try this restaurant. The burgers are wonderful, and they'll even make it something called Protein style if you are on the Atkins diet. Protien style means your burger comes in a lettuce wrap. Also are you locals all aware of the secret menu (do a google search on In-n-out secret menu)? Animal Style Fries? Napolean-style shake? mmmmmmm I'm going there for lunch. Oh yeah and not to be confused with EZ Out. That place blows
