Although it doesn't have a lot of foul language, it has enough to bother me, so I deducted a star. Other than that, what a GREAT comedy. I've always liked Gene Wilder and Teri Garr (for different reasons, obviously), and Marty Feldman is even good in this one. Some of the best humor emerges when you take a putatively sober subject and poke fun at it.
