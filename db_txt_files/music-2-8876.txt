This song is not all that great... it don't really have a high repeat factor... I'v eheard it a million times on the radio and I am really getting tired of it... I don't know what the big deal is a bout her... Her songs are no too bad but they do need some cooling down... It is a tad to whiny and she is too hyped up. and the vid to this song is kinda lame and could be better. There are better artistsd in her catagory. and most of her songs on her cd sound the same. Not realy worth buying the whole thing...
