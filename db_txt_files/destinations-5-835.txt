Come visit America Jr.! That's right, I said it. Canada is America Jr. Don't see it? You must be blind, or a complete as*hole. And no, I'm not dissing Canada at all, so quit saying that I am. Great fishing here and the only problem I got is they don't say about, they say aboot. That's my only problem with America Jr., other than that...visit America Jr today.
