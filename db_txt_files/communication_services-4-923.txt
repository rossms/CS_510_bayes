I live in the heart of the Midwest. I have never experienced a dropped or a missed call with this company. However, what I do have frequently happen is billing errors! I have more than once had to call, and even go down to the office to get charges removed for calls that were supposed to be in my coverage area. Make sure you ask for detailed answers when inquiring about their plans!
