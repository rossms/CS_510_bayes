I find this place good, but not the best place. But the reason why I give this place a 5 is that they bring the food to you when you're sitting down. I like their breakfast menu and the Roast Beef sandwiches, especially their fries. and spellbound571969, i don't have one favorite ffc.UPDATE: I just read that their Monster thickburger has lots of calories and carbs, possibly more fat than you average big mac.
