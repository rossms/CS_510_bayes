I truly enjoy this album because I was thrilled to find a band that produces quality rock music with a good female lead. The majority of the songs are quite good with Amy Lee's beutiful voice and plaintive lyrics. Some do tend to get monotonous though, sounding like the one before. All in all, its a good debut.
