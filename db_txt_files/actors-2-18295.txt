Did I ever actually enjoy a Kubrick film? No, I don't think so. I know it's sacriligious to say, but while 2001 Clockwork Orange Full Metal Jacket and The Shining were all interesting films, I can hardly imagine a more miserable day the one where I'd have to sit through them all again. And Eyes Wide Shut was so horrible I didn't bother to watch the second half.
