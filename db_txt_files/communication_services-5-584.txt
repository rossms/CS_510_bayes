Great Value..Im in the Sacto area and have no real complaints about the coverage...as good or better than sprint that absolutly raped me with overtime fee's. I have the Kyocera phone and it has good bat life and has survived many falls. I love the 53.00 a month for unlimited phone calls, unlimited long distance and unlimited text.
