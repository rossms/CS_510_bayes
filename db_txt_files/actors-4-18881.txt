Maybe I'm just not in the right age bracket, but I never really enjoyed The Big Chill. It just seemed kind of boring to me. But Kasdan also directed Body Heat (which in junior high school I happily watched on HBO when my parents weren't around) and Silverado, a great western with Kevin Kline and Danny Glover.
