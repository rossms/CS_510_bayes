It is kind of a shame that Dominique was left off of the list of the 50 Greatest players for the NBA. If he had not gotten screwed by the hawks in a crummy trade, i think he would have had some more quality years in his career which would jave provided him with a better backdrop of qualifications to make a name for himself.
