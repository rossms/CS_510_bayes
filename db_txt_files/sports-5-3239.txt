The Best ballplayer EVER to play the game. Only time was against him. Not only did Hammerin' Hank break the Bambino's HR record, he came in the ballpark of getting about 3700 hits. PLus Hank's Batting average and Impeccable. Say what you want about Bonds or Griffey and these other 'roid pumped record breakers, but there will NEVER be another Ballplayer of Hank Aaron's calliber.
