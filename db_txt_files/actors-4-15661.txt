Connie Marshall was born in 1938. She was a noted child model, and then appeared in several movies in the mid and late 1940s. Unfortunately most of her movies are out-of print or only on VHS. However, the DVD of the 1948 Mr. Blandings builds his dream house is readily available. She plays a daughter to Cary Grant and Mryna Loy. Sharlyn Moffett plays her sister. An excellent light comedy.
