Dragonsdawn is a personal favorite of mine...and I have nearly every book she has written...well at least every title... Drigonriders has evolved from a few short stories to a new universe. When can I get a ticket for passage on teh Yoko? (I can fix almost anything- and would wash dishes just to be there!) grin
