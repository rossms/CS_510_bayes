Warren Sapp is acting like a sap! Where has the defense been when they were really needed? Absent - on the sidelines sucking wind. If Sapp would expend less energy dancing through the opponents warm up drills, bumping into refs, and kicking endzone markers, maybe he would have some energy left for the 4th quarter when the defense needs to make a stop. Get a clue Warren, your skills a waning, you can't afford to run off at the mouth if you can't run in the 4th.
