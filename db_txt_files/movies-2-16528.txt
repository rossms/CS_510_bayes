It wasn't the worst movie I ever saw but it was pretty awful. Take the advice of Shroomwoman and don't waste your money on this one, I wouldn't even rent it I'd wait to see if it happens to come on as a TV movie in a few years. It was basically a cross between Cocoon and Armageddon. Like so many Hollywood films it looked as if this one might have had some potential but take my advice the preview is as good as it gets.
