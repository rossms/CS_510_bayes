You can actually have a tour of SOME of Buck Palace, and whenever I go past there (I live in London) it hasn't really been crowded. If you get bored of Buck Palace, walk down Pall Mall and you hit Trafalger Square, Leicester Square, Piccadilly Cicus - which leads onto Regents Street and Oxford Street. I;m not too keen on the palace, but I love that huge statue outside, great for photographing close-ups of the different figures on there.
