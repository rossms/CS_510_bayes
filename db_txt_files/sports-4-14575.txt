calling this guy the best linebacker ever is just talk by the uninformed. i remember a lot of people saying carl banks was better at run-stopping and coverage after 1987. he was an impact player for about five years, but didn't really show up in the two super bowls. like most overrated defensive players, much better in pursuit than at the point
