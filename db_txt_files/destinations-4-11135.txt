Viriginia Beach is a nice place to visit. Are there nicer boardwalks and beaches yes but this one is nice. The beach is very nice, the boardwalk is a little cheesy. There is plenty to do and I would go back there. However it would not be my first choice to visit. I like Ocean City, hampton beach and Jesrsey boardwalks better. But unlike Megallan's review I am not holding a bad drunk to the falt of Virginia Beach.
