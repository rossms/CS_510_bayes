They have come a long way and I was very pleased to see John Fruscante (spelling?) back in the group after a six-year hiatus. It's almost as if they were saying, hey John is back in the group, let's make him feel at home with mature and meaningful sounds. After hearing this album, you'd be stunned to know that this was the same group that donned nothing but socks and had an album (Freaky Styley) that contained raw funky tunes that seemed to be the signature of Santa Monica scene on a Saturday night.
