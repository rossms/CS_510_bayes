The book was absolutely brilliant. Unfortunately, the movie was only a shadow of the book. Usually I'm forgiving of book to movie translations, because I know that something has to be lost. But in this case, I think that the movie misrepresented the spirit of the book in many places. My recommendation would be to get the book and forget the movie.
