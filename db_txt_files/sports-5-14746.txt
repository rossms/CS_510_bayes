Hard to not give five stars to the leading rusher of all time. I don't have him in my top five, probably not top ten. He was however a great running back. Yes he ran forever but in an age where talented players can't keep their legs under them longevity is almost as important as talent. Let us not forget that most running backs are retired when he was busting out 20 + TDs. So just because you don't like him give the man some credit.
