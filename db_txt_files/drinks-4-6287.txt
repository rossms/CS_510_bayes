Diet Rite rules! First of all, it's the best-tasting diet cola on the market. And it's also as close to being genuinely healthy as soda gets. No caffeine, no sodium, no sugar, and since it is made with Splenda rather than aspratame, it doesn't have the side effects of most diet sodas (i.e. craving carbs). It's still no substitute for Coke or Pepsi taste-wise, and water is still the healthiest thing to drink, but if you're health-conscious and you have the desire to drink a cola then Diet Rite is the drink for you!
