My absolute favorite candy! They are bite size, chewy, chocolatey and perfect for snacking!! A few warnings about Raisinets, however...1) they are addictive, you can easily eat too many (ha...assuming you can eat too many of such delicious candy) 2) although they are somewhat lower in fat than most candy, remember that they are covered in chocolate...they're not celery sticks, people!, and finally 3) if you hate raisins, you're probably not going to be a Raisinet lover.
