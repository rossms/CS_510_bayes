This is the most wonderful department store I have ever entered! I first set foot in it 23 years ago and finally again last year on my long awaited return to London. Everything you could possibly want; beautiful atmosphere full of history and elegance and extremely polite, knowledgeable and helpful staff. If you are in London put it at the top of your list of places to visit and shop!
