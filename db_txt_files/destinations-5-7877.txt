WOW! Made going to boot camp at Great Lakes worthwhile! I'll never forget the view. Considering I was just a country boy who had never been out of the hills, I couldn't have been more awed if I had been on the space shuttle...LOL! I wish I still had that ability to be awed. Something about age that takes it from you, I guess.
