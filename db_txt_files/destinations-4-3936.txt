I can only speak as a visitor for a short time. The women here are amazing, probably the best in the USA. This place feels like the Caribbean. If you are into walking cities, I don't think Miami would suit you though. People are always saying Cubans 'stick to themselves' here or that they are 'stand-offish' but I traveled with plenty of folks of differing ethnicities and racial backgrounds and we were all treated wonderfully. Tons of fun. Only thing that turns me off is the high crime rate, particularly the high homocide rate. Great club/bar scene.
