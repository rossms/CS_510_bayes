I've lived there and eventhough it's expensive it's a great place to live! (never spent much money on Oktoberfest but still have been there 3 times--just to see the tourists) You may find the subway system impressive. As well as the Olympiahalle, Olympisches Garten/Dorf and BMW museum.. Can't run out of things to do there, and you'll miss all the life on Marienplatz.
