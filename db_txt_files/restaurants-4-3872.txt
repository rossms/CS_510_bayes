I had this pizza for the first time at a friend's house, and I was a little suspicious of the concept. However, it turned out to be pretty good. I admit I was pretty blown away, but I also admit I wouldn't have been so blown away by it if there hadn't been the concept of take'n'bake involved. Anyway, pretty good pizza. Great price. I love getting pizzas here if I'm at a party and no one's delivering. Just think ahead, and you'll have pizza for all.
