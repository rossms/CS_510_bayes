The best secret in FL. If you are looking for a pure beach vacation, this is where you need to go. Don't go to the Atlantic Coast in FL, you have to go to the panhandle! These beaches (including Destin and Fort Walton Beach)are southern towns with beautiful beaches for the family. Highly recommended.
