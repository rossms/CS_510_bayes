There is no where in the world like Vegas. Sure it is somwhat tacky in areas. But where else can you do you anything you want, at anytime you want, and is symbolic of the great freedoms we have as Americans. Some people say vegas has lost its wild west feel it used to have in the 60s and 70s, and appeals more to families now. This is true to a degree, but much of the city is still the wild hedonistic party that it is known and loved for.
