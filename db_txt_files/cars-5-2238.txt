Upon its introduction in 1969/70, the 240Z was a car that offered incredible styling, performance, and reliability... three traits unheard of at that time for any car at any price. The tradition of offering incredibly balanced cars continued up until the demise of the Z32 in 1996. As a proud owner of a '90 Nissan 300ZX TwinTurbo, it is truely apparent that this car shines in every imaginable category. Some may outclass it in certain areas, but as a whole package, Nissan got everything right.
