I liked the movie. The plot was original and brought up some serious questions about how to deal with terrorists (I agree with Travolta's method, as opposed to govt pussies). The thing I didn't like is that Travolta's here was made unnecessarily and unbelievebly ruthless for someone who strifes for the greater good. Too bad, could have been perfect.
