After 4 years at Grinnell, graduate school was easy. The classes are intellectually stimulating, and small enough that professors really get to mentor students. Students are laid-back, fun, smart, non-competitive and socially conscious. Most are liberal, but not all are. No matter what your beliefs or political leanings, Grinnell will challenge you. Some of my beliefs changed as a result, and others I hold more dear because I was forced to really think about them. What more could you want from a college education?
