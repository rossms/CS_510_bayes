Smooth, full-bodied, creamy, satisfying Guinness. Drink it with blackcurrant juice, if you like, drink it in a black and tan, pour a packet of salted peanuts into it, as a friend of mine used to do, drink it on tap if at all possible, but, if you are a beer drinker, at least give it a try. Three cheers for Guinness!
