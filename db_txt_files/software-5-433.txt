Sorry but in my oppinion windows ME is THE BEST windows operating system there is! Its very, very stable, compatible with more programmes than any other windows operating system and only takes up just over half a gig of hard drive space! Handy when you only have 20gig to start with! I have used all the others including windows XP (which is the biggest joke Microshaft have ever made!) and its still the one I would go back to (although Windows 2000 comes in a very close second!)
