Well, well, well... good chocolate cookies, these ain't! Very artificial chocolate taste these cookies have. And the creme... ugh, the creme is horrible ultra-sweet icing like stuff. The redeeming factor, though, is that used in ice creme, these things can mix well (particularly chocolate chip mint ice creme).
