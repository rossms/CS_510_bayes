The greatest college football coach of all time in my opinion: never had a losing season, never had a hint of scandal, a class act through-and-through. Probably would have gotten more national recognition if his teams had one a few more Rose Bowls. In fairness, though, there were a lot of close losses that could have gone the other way: 1-point loss on last second FG to Stanford in '72; the fumble that was called a TD against USC, etc.
