For you lame brains out there in liberal land, Reagan didn't spend a dime, the Tip O'Neill led Congress did. Every budget Reagan submitted was considered DOA by the democrats. Look it up before you bare your stupidity. I could state more facts, but why waste my time. If you believe in a convicted liar like Clinton, I truly feel sorry for you.
