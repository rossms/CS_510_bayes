I enjoyed this film for two reasons. One, The casting was done quite well. Everyone from the good girl to the evil, back-stabbing character to the character who is always the voice of reason is extremely believable. Two, it explains and portrays the life of a Geisha without straying into other plots which happens often in most films. The film is follows the life of a young girl who is from a poor family who is sold to a Geisha house and becomes one of the greatest.
