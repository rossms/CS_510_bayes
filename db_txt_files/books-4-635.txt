I was so delighted with this book as a litle girl. I fell in love with the prose-like way Frances Hodgson Burnett told her sad, sweet story. The descriptions of both the characters and the landscapes are beautiful. This book could prove difficult for some young readers because the language is old-fashioned and a bit hierarchal. Definitely a classic.
