I transferred to SJSU from the highly overrated Cal Poly, San Luis Obispo. The teachers here(at least that I have had)are first-rate and have years of experience in industry prior to entering the classroom. The resources for finding internships, writing resumes, and all the rest of it are very helpful. And what better place to study if you want a job here in the Valley? Local tech firms are very into SJSU students and grads. All in all a great place. I love it here.
