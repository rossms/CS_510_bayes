I DO BELIEVE THE NAME SHOULD BE CHANGED TO DRIVE-THRU. MOST MODERN CARS HAVE TOO MUCH OF A SLANT ON THE SIDE WINDOW TO CALL FOR A RESURRECTION OF AN ACTUAL DRIVE-IN EATERY. BUT TOO, REALESTATE IS THROUGH THE ROOF MAKING IT MORE OF A CHALLENGE TO PAY FOR A PARKING LOT BIG ENOUGH TO FIT ALL THE CARS BELONGING TO THOSE FAST FOOD JUNKIES OF TODAY. AND WHO WOULD HAVE THE TIME TO WAIT IN THAT VAST SEA OF VEHICLES? I'M GOING TO WENDY'S 2 STARS ON THE ROOT BEER IN THE FROZEN MUGS.
