How did the Hokies lose to FSU? UPDATE: The Hokies did the right thing by kicking out the clueless and classless Marcus Vick. In case you've been living under a rock since January 2nd, Vick purposely stomped Dumervil DE of U of L right on the back of the knee. VT would be stupid to keep him on campus. Update. He will enter the draft. But the question is, who will fill Vick's shoes?
