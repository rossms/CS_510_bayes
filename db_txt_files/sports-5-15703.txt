Brian Urlacher is the best MLB in the NFL today. You guys say ray lewis is better??? i don't think so and heres why.. Urlacher put up higher numbers than Lewis did his Rookie year with a weaker defense and to mention Urlacher is just faster and a all around better player than any MLB in the game including Ray Lewis. Urlacher has only been in the NFL for 3 years, and how many pro bowls has he been to? Thats right 3! Brain will go down in history as the greatest defensive player to ever play the game. Hes that good
