I love London! Like every city, it has its bad parts, but it really is for the most part fantastic. But for the person who said Don't expect great weather , (a) it depends on the time of the year you go - it can be absolutely beautiful in summer(though bear in mind that Britain's weather is some of the hardest to predict in the world), and (b), a trip to London is generally not because of the weather. It's because of the good sights, beautiful architecture, great theatre and restaurants, etc. Of course, I'll get to see it more than once in my lifetime, seeing as I live in Scotland!
