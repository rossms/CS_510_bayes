Highly intelligent, Bradley would have probably made a decent president had he won the prize in 2000. He lacked charisma somewhat, even compared to his former opponent Al Gore, but an objective analysis shows that Bradley would have been able to hold his own in high office given that many of his ideas were sound. Probably should have run earlier or at least stayed in public office; today we just don't see a whole lot of him.
