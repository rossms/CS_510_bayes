For a sugar high to begin the day, you can depend on Frosted Flakes. Literally drenched in sugar, this crunchy, tasty cereal is tough to resist. Something tells me that it is actually a dessert, but I allow myself to be fooled and have it for breakfast. Tony the Tiger, perhaps the cutest cereal mascot ever, adds to Frosted Flakes' appeal. Frosted Flakes - they're GRRRREAT!
