Felton is awesome. He is the heart and soul of the Carolina team, ad it definitely showed in the first game against Santa Clara. The reason the Heels lost was because Felton wasn't in the game to bring the energy and strength that he does. He makes mistakes, all players do, however, given a choice from any ACC point guard, Felton would be my pick hands down. He does what he needs to, when he needs to, and is humble about it! Can everyone say that about Redick???
