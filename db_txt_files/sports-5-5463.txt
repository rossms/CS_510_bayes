As a KU fun I'm biased, but I think Gooden deserves to be player of the year, especially if he leads the Jayhawks deep into the tournament. Apparently he was pretty unhappy his freshman year, feeling that Roy Williams wasn't playing him enough, was too hard on him, etc. But he sucked it up, learned that Williams knew best, and matured into the best player in the Big 12, if not the country. Gooden has become a star at the college level, and I won't be surprised if he does the same thing in the NBA.
