Looks like CoachRod (What do you coach? 1st Grade Girls Dodgeball?) had a baaaaaaaad Christmas last year. What happened Rod, did ya only get coal? If you think Bo is/was overrated you obviously spent too much time around those first graders instead of watching SEC football in '84 & '85. Here's $1.00 Rod. Go buy someone else's opinion next time!
