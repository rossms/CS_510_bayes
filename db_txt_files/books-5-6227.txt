If thos book was the autobiography of Moore, it would have been entitled STUPID WHITE MAN. In this volume, he comes across as a broading, opiniated jerk. ALl who agree with him are okay, but dare to oppose and you are treated as an enemy. Rush Limbuagh is very much like Moore. His act gets tiresome after awhile.
