The problem rating Glengoyne is that we do not know what we are rating. A 10 years old is good, but a 17 or 21 years is far more than great. Assuming rating is asked for the 10 years version, I just can consider this whisky from the border between Highlands and Lowlands a good (even a little bit more than that...)
