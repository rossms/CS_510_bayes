This movie was pretty bad. I liked the first volume. I did, really. However, this one was a colossal bore. Didn't we see the wise-asian master cliche in the first movie? Besides being a cliche, he was a very annoying character. Futhermore, this movie had a lot of filler and uninteresting dialogue. I was actually hoping Uma Thurman's character would die so I wouldn't have to suffer through one more of her flashbacks. Also, it was waaay to obvious how she was going to Kill Bill. The first movie was fast pace and exciting, while this one is very sluggish and dull. Be prepared to be disappointed.
