We've got a few A W drive-ins spread across Lake George, NY which is the perfect spot for these kind sof places. It's open most of the summer, but we never go too often. They have good corn dogs and ice cream floats there. But, we have to go like on an hour a half drive to there, so we go like twice a year.
