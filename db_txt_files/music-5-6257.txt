even though it's my second fav albom from him (the first being mechanical animals), i must say this albom kept me company NON STOP for half a year, and i even had to get another copy cus i overplayed it eventually. this albom is the most hardcore-evil like-shockgoth albom to be ever created. it contains his most aggressivly powerful songs, and his most beautiful one (man that you fear). this albom got me into rock, nietzche, and lyric writing, which was more than any other artist or music.
