I only drink Twisted Tea. All my local pubs now carry it. I just bought it in cans for the first time last week. I also get it on tap and in the bottle. No matter which way it comes, I love it every time. I am hooked..I am in Vermont..I truly felt like the only one drinking it here, but now its all the rave.
