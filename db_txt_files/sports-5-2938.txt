He is probably the greatest all-around player to ever live. It is so unknown that he was a great hitter for average, too. He had a .393 average one year! He was a masterful pitcher and obviously hit 714 homers in his illustrious career. The legends surrounding this icon are many: the called shot, the infield homerun, etc. I couldn't possibly have said my comment any better than potch1214, right on brother!
