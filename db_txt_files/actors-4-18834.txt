Here's a relatively new director with all kinds of potential. Anyone who can mastermind the dark world of Se7en has something interesting going on. And Fight Club, while not an excellent movie, was still well-done. Fincher seems to specialize in movies with dark, brooding atmospheres, and it will be interesting to see if he can improve his use of that style to a level that lets him create a movie with real importance.
