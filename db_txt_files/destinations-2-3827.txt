I lived there for 16 years. Pluses include overall fairly low cost of living especially resaonable real estate prices. There is a lot to do: museums, parks, festivals, near to Niagra falls and Toronto, the Finger Lakes and dozens of wineries, Minor league soccer, baseball, hockey, NFL in Buffalo, Etc. Great colleges and universities. NEGATIVES include a decling economy (NO JOBS!), horrendously long winters and 220 cloudly days per year. Spring and fall quite short. Many people have had to or decided to move away. Oh and 100 inches of snow per year. Winter esentially is November thru April.
