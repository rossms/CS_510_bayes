not a good beer. has the aura of a decent beer b/c people go through such lengths to add lime and salt to Corona. here's a test: take a budweiser and put lime and salt as additions, and i'll bet you it tastes the exact same. have a corona w/o the garnish and what you have is a plain thin beer that exists on tricks and gimmicks
