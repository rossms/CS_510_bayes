The best French leader since Da Gaulle. He opposed the war in Iraq and he upheld France's secular tradition when he passed the law banning religious icons in French public schools. A lot better than George W. Bush who is a pro-religious warhawk who likes to allow students to wear their religious symbols in our public schools where they don't belong. We need someone like Jacques Chirac to run this messed up country of ours. Maybe that person will be John Kerry if he wins in November.
