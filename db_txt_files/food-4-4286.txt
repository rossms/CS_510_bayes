I know these have been around quite awhile because I can remember eating them when my hands were still small enough to pop one on each finger and pretend I had claws. Aside from their obvious entertainment value, I also like the crunchy corn flavor of Bugles- even if they tend to be a little on the greasy side. I remember back when they first came out along with two or three other snack foods (kind of as a group) whose names I can no longer remember but have since disappeared from the market. Not a bad occasional snack food choice that seems to have surprising staying power in an over-saturated market.
