The Discworld series is just the best series I ve ever read. It never gets boring, there is always something new in each book.You can read them for light entertainment, as they are incredibly funny. But at the same time, they are deeply philosophical (they tend to get more serious over time) and give you a lot to think about, without ever losing their humour. I wouldn t believe it if I hadn t read them all.
