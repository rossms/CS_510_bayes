T-Mac has shown amazing ability in the games that I've seen him play as of lately, but quite the mouse in his first couple of years. He often requires incentive to play, showing the Magic franchise that they should more often trade away his friends on the team. He's a good player and he has the potential to be great, but he is often lured by candy and does not play with the pure love of the game that was so often evident in the two MJ s.
