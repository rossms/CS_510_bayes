Ok now first off, as a male I was not expected to like this movie. And I did not. There were a few good parts but not many. Overall a bit to mushy. However James Belushi was fantastic as the man's man brotherly type. And his movie wife Bonnie Hunt was equally good. The 2 main stars were pretty poor and over dramatic. Probly not recommended to anyone except the most chicky of chicks.
