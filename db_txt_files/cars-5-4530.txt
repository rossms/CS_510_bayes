Well I think My Silverado is great, It does everything i need it to do and never complains, never been in for any repairs and it gets over 22 MPG on the highway. I won;t get into the debate on whose trucks are better, It depends on how you use them, every truck had it's good points and bad, and as far as i am concerned i am very happy with mine.
