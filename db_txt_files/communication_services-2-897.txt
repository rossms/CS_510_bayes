STI MOBILE NEEDS to UPDATE their website to cover the new plans. They need to explain the billing process and ALL CHARGES!. Many links on the website still have outdated information. Do not buy their product until you understand all the additional charges. IE. Voice Mail, Activation fee, & International Rates vs Airtime...etc etc. Reviewing the calling plans. Plan 1# - Sub average, Libery Wireless has a better rates. Plan#2. Very good for the person who doesn't call much and needs a cell phone. $1.95 per month charge, 12/10 cents per minute, Peak/Offpeak.
