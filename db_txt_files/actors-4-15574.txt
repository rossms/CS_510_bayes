Tempestt gave an impressive performance playing the next-to-the-youngest Huxtable girl, Vanessa. Growing into her teens on "The Cosby Show", she dealt with the typical problems of adolescence. Some favorite Vanessa episodes: A 13-year-old Vanessa puts on makeup, even when Clair tells her she has to wait two more years. Later, in another episode, she plays the "Alphabet Game" at a party held at a friend's home, gets drunk in the process, and learns the hard way after being sick all day in school.
