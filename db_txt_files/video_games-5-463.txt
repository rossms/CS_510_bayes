This is the undisputed King of board games. My wife and I have had many a good fights playing this game over the years. Sometime this game can last into the wee hours. When you're losing you really feel like quiting, but as soon as things start to go your way, you get a surge of energy. There is nothing like winning Monopoly and rubbing it their faces, c'mon you know we all do it.
