You can put this at the top of American ales. I always pour my beers into a clean pint glass. This ale, when poured, leave a great head of foam for quite a while. The palate can taste the balance between the hops and the malt and it leaves you wanting another sip. This ale has a deep amber color and has a consistent carbonation flow as bubbles travel from the bottom to the top of the glass. Hey, who wants a flat beer? This is actually a beer I can eat with food. I tried it with a burger and fries.
