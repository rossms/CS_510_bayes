Gifted Irish actor who was unfortunately taken from us much too soon. Excellent, versatile actor best known for his stunning portrayal of the crusty, argumentative Quint in Jaws, for which he should have won Best Supporting actor in 1975. Also known for his role as a mob boss in The Sting, for playing a Bond villain, and for very effectively playing Henry the 8th in A Man for All Seasons. Underrated still.
