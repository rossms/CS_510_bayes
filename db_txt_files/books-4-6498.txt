If you like witty, contemporary single title romances, you'll like this. Jennifer Crusie has a distinctive writing style that takes a little time to appreciate. (Notice her dialogue tags.) Although the heroine does some very stupid things at the beginning of the book, they are necessary to set up the story. They give her room to grow as the story progresses. I enjoyed CRAZY FOR YOU more than this book, but Jennifer Crusie is a favorite.
