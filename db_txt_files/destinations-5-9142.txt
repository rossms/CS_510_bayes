I love Athens! I don't understand comments where people say they liked the Acropolis, but didn't like the city... I have to admit, though, that I lived in Athens for a few months and it wasn't until after the first 8 or 10 days that I really started to like the city. The Acropolis IS a skeleton, but it's beautiful in spite of it... or because of it. It's haunting and breathtaking. And you can see it from almost anywhere in the city.
