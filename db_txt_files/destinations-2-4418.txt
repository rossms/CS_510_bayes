Lambeau Field is the main reason to see this city - the stadium is an amazing shrine to football history, and it's fascinating to see a major NFL stadium on what looks like a main street in a small town. It's frankly astounding that this 80,000 person town has a major football team. But outside of Lambeau, this is a fairly industrial town with not much to recommend it except the proximity to beautiful Door County.
