Ariel Sharon is the man with the worst job in the world. He is supposed to make peace in an area that has never known peace in the history of the world. The problem is that neither side wants peace, both sides would prefer the elimination of the other. The bible says that we are to pray for the peace of Jerusalem , and I do. I also pray daily for wisdom for Ariel Sharon, but without God's intervention I don't see how there can be peace.
