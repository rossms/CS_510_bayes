I am employed by CVS. I enjoy the work I do as a pharmacy technician. The customers at our store are wonderful, they make my day. I also have deep respect for most of the pharmacists that I work with. BUT... I cannot think of anything good to say about the CVS corporation. I would never shop at a CVS. Customers are locked out of the bathrooms, and must do the math on their purchases if they buy more than one item. Corporate CVS puts unreasonable pressures on their pharmacists and treats the rest of their employees like dirt.
