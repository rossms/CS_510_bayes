Charlotte struck me as a very clean city. The radio stations there are good, and there seems to be a lot of civic pride, especially regarding the Carolina Panthers (who have good tailgaters and friendly fans, by the way). On the downside, the local highway infrastructure seems a bit small for a city its size, although they deserve credit for getting I-485 built. Next order of business: Widen I-77 between I-85 and I-40. Overall, Charlotte was a nice city.
