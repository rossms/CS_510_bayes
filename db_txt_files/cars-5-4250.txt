To all owners of Chevy Astro and GMC Safari vans: Do you have a stubborn electric rear hatch release that works, but does not release the hatch? Take the side of your fist and hit the outside of the hatch with your hand. Try the hatch release again, it schould work. Does your electric fuel door stick? Knock on the outside of the fuel door and try it again. It schould come open. Otherwise great vehicle! See my quote under GMC Safari on this website.
