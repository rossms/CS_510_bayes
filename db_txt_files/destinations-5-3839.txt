Columbus, is one of the best cities in North America and that is a fact. Columbus is one of cheapest cities in America to eat or rent an apartment. I payed 265 dollars a month for a brand new 1 bedroom apartment in a clean neighborhood with nice parks and tons of stores. Columbus is one of the most integrated, friendliest and cleanest cities in the country. OSU has a massive campus, the size of a small city with tons of stores on adjecent High Street that cater to every niche you can possible have.
