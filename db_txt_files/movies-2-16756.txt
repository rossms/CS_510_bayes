This movie was very beautiful - the cinemaphotography, the costumes, the settings, the cast. However, the story was NOT good - it did not hold together well and I left with lots of questions that should have been answered by the movie. And Matt Damon was seriously outclassed in the acting skills department by Cate Blanchett and Gwyneth Paltrow.
