Efficient and goes everywhere in the city, but wow, is it confusing. You can easily go the wrong way, get on an Express train you didn't want to be on, or not be sure where to transfer. It could also use some cleaning. However, the station agents are very friendly, they give good directions if you do get lost, and the whole system is quite a lot safer than I would have expected - there are so many people there at all hours of the day and night, just for starters.
