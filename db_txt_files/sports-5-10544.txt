As a Badger fan living here in the SEC, if Coach A had any of the talent that these guys get down here he would have won multiple (BCS)championships. No other coach takes so many stones and polishes them into diamonds. Look at all the UW alumn in the NFL, it kinds of speaks for itself. The coach is great and will be surely missed by the true Badger fans who understand football. the Big-10 is such a better conference than the SEC in every category but never get the due respect because we don't have the flash.
