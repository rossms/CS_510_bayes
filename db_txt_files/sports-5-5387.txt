nick collison is by far one of the greatest basketball players to walk the face of this earth! so what if ku lost to the orangemen? it doesnt matter because KU and Syracuse supporters both know what the truth is and that is that KU had a very off night, had bad defense and okay offense but they didnt give it their all. if they would have shown more aggresion earlier in the game and made 52% of their free throws than they would be the champs. but in my heart and theirs we know they are the best.
