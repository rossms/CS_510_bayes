Definitely unlike anywhere else in the world. Make sure you've got a clear map if you're walking around, it's easy to get lost with all of the canals and dark alleys... but getting lost in Venizia isn't the worst thing in the world. There's always a neat little shop or a restaurant around the corner. Go to San Marco Square in the morning before anyone else is around to appreciate the true beauty of the most heavily touristed area in the city. Gondola rides are overrated and overpriced.
