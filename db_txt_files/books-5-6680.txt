oh man this book is so spellbinding. i was just astounded from having never read so fine a piece of literature. not only does it start, progress and end perfectly, but i think what i liked best about it is the way bilbo gradually learns and grows through the book - his personal journey from simple, traditional and respectable old hobbit to clever and cunning action hero. yet through it all he's still just humble little old bilbo. besides being a hobbit, he was always just a regular person, which is what i loved cause i alwasy felt i could relate to his character
