Edith Wharton was really a wonderful writer. Her books make it clear that being rich and socially connected ain't all it's cracked up to be. Being a romantic, I was of course disappointed that the protagonist didn't end up with his lady love, the exotic Countess Olenska. Martin Scorcese also did a fine cinematic adaptation of The Age of Innocence in 1993.
