I have to agree with TropicalOne about the DC area. I lived in Northern Virginia for a little while, and couldn't stand it. Very cookie-cutter type development, very cold, snobby, power-hungry people. Politics and power not only pervade DC proper, but also invade the areas just outside DC. It's a great place to visit, many reviews can tell you that. But it's a crappy place to live, unless you too are into the power-hungry mold.
