I found Crazy/beautiful to be one of the more realalistic teen movies out there. It had a rich white girl fall in love witha guy of a different race, and she is out of control were as he is all about the grades and sucsess. I loved it how Kirstin Dunst didn't have the polished makeup, the perfect clothes, and how you could see every blemish on her face. it just made me get into the movie much more. The relationship between all the characters I loved and found it to be one of the better teen movies out there, hopefully we can see more substance like this and less crap.
