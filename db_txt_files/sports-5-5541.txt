I give him a 5 on the sheer fact that he is a freshman, and still performing up to the high standards that Roy Williams poses. He will be great, considering he's had defining moments already, and as far as I can see, he's shaking off his rookie mistakes and upping his game. If he continues his growth, he could be big... he just needs to stay all four years!!!
