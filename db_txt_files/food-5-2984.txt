My, these are delicious! I only buy Keebler Fudge Sticks once a year because I cannot control myself when they're in the house. These addictive little treats are the ideal combination of rich fudge, vanilla filling, and wafer, and they have a nice crunch. I could eat half a package without blinking an eye.
