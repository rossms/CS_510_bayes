His looks and smile are incredible (everyone knows that). His acting, however, is also incredible. I can't give him a 5 quite yet only because I've seen him act in two movies only. The Patriot (in which he did a fine job at), and Ten Things I hate About you (which was also good). I'll be back to change my rating when I see another movie of his. I'd give him a 4.5 if I could. He needs to be given more opportunities. I just can't get enough of Heath!:(
