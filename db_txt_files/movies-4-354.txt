Gladiator was an overall well done movie, I think Ridley Scott did a very well job on catching the actors emotions. He also did a very good job catching the battle scenes which were actually done with some thought unlike brainless attempts such as Red Sonia. Russel Crowe and Joaquin Pheonix stand out as excellent actors. Its a long movie full of action, romance and suspence. Although its not the best movie of the year its definetly worth 5.50 to rent.
