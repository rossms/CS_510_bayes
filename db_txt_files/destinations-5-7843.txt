The Shedd Aquarium has no real flaws at all. Probably the most complete aquarium in the United States, Shedd boasts having fish from all over the world, and some of the biggest whales found in a public aquarium, namely, the Beluga Whales. Also, as someone else stated, the best place to get a photo of the Chicago skyline is from between the Shedd Aquarium and the Adler Planetarium.
