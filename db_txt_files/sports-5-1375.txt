One of my favorite players on the Yankees. I'm often disappointed they put the overrated Tino Martinez loser in at 1st instead of Giambi. Sure Giambi isn't the greatest fielder in the world, but I've seen Tino make costly errors in the past week that I'm quite sure Giambi would not make. Plus Giambi has bat power well beyond Tino's capabilities. If the Yankees wanted a good fielding/good hitting 1st baseman as Giambi's backup, they should have kept Tony Clark!
