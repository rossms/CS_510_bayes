I work at an IHOP, and im a super nice waitress, im seriously running back and forth non-stop during my work day..however..people make mistakes!! when IHOP is full on a Sunday morning, mistakes are bound to happen, and it bothers me that people get all wound up..IHOP is not a high class restaurant..if you leave us 2 dollar tips...expect that kind of service...anyhow, our food is great and we are extremely clean, and we constantly have secret shoppers so we're always doing our best
