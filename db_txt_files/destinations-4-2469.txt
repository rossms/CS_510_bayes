Clearwater Beach can get crowded, but it is a huge beach and is great for people watching and always has alot of things going on. The beach I like the best though is to the south, Pass-a-Grille, alot of people mistakingly think it's a gay beach, which is not the case. The water is perfectly clear, the sand powder white and it is never crowded. The surrounding area has a small town atmosphere and there are no high rise condos or hotels built on the beach.
