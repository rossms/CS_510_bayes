First, the good points: it took place in France (and I LOVE things that are French), and it took place in the late 1950s. However....like so much that comes out of Tinsel Town these days, it was a hard slap in the face of the Catholic Church. I'm not Catholic and don't ever plan to be. But how many times do the film makers have to keep characterizing them so negatively? Religious people are not mostly hypocrites, and non-religious people are not all noble.
