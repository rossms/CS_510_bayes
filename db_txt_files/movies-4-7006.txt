I liked this movie. Matthew Broderick was great as Ferris,the smooth talking teenager who could get away with most anything. Even his principal and sister cannot succeed at catching him. He takes yet another day off from school and takes his best friend and girlfriend with him.and spends the day going around Chicago. this is a pretty funny movie. I guess the only hard time I have is being the parent of a teenager it is a little hard to see Ferris get away with everything. Even though I cannot help but find Ferris to be a likable person.
