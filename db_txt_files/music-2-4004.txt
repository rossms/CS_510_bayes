Get this uninspired run-of-the-mill garbage out of here. If it were not for Joghn Cusack with a boom box on his shoulders in 'Say Anything'and a couple of 'crazy and unique' videos, this CD would have gone unnoticed like the rest of Peter Gabriel's work since his departure form Genesis. This record stinks and does not deserve to be grouped with the classics.
