This album is the epitome of teenage rebellion in the late 60s with its dark lyrics. I find it ironic that it's evened out with its pleasant single You Can't Always Get What You Want . It's almost wisdomatic after the approach of this album is pretty much about raising hell, doing dope, and getting knocked up. Still, it has its share of that great bluesy rock sound.
