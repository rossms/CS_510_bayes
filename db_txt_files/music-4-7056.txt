This is a good depends what version you are talking about. Now the version I like a whole lot better is the original version from the 1970's. This is where the live action is and the techinques of that time is very interesting. Now the Movie Version of Wayne's World was not bad either but I gave that a smaller rating than the action so the 4 stars is in the middle of the 2. The movie version was more funnier and very laughable but I just prefer to watch Freddy Mercury than watching Wayne and Garth if you know what I mean.
