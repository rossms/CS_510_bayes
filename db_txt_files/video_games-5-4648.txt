The other day I somehow managed to find my hand-held Donkey Kong Nintendo game in the attic that I used to play when I was Nine. I picked it up and started playing with it again and I didn't want to put it down. Unlike todays games where the graphics are getting more and more like movies and special effects are practically diverting from the whole objective of why we're playing, simple games like Donkey Kong, Pacman, Frogger and Space Invaders are just basically an intention to go back to the basics and have fun.
