I realy wonder what is going on with MCI and the wrong rates. I changed my service to them, and found that they too gave me wrong rate. You won't notice it unless you really look into your bill closely. The same thing happened to my brother and some of my friends. Maybe MCI just wants to get easy money from customers who rarely check their phone bill. AT T is the best. The only reason why I switched is the 5-cents deal. So, if you don't really need the 5-cents rate as I do, then avoid using MCI.
