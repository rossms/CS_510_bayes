Windows 95 was a huge leap up from MSDOS and the previous versions of Windows that were essentially shells as opposed to an actual operating system. A good faith attempt at making installing new hardware easier for novices using plug and play technology as well as recognition software. Though not supported anymore (it's hard to believe that it's been almost ten years since the release of Windows 95), the fact that this operating system was so far advanced over its predecessors earns four stars from me.
