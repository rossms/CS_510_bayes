I'm not fond of the styling of the 7 series or most of the new Bimmers for that matter. I'm not sure what Chris Bangle and his design team were trying to accomplish. With that said, this car is a technological tour de-force, and stays true to the 7 series priciples - Luxury AND responsiveness - A 5 rating for the V-12.
