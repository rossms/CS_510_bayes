Incredible colors and great diversity. Octopus, Sharks, GIANT giant clams. Even the clownfish anemone were more impressive than I've seen elsewhere. Recommended? Definately. But be sure to get to the OUTER REEF, away from the rest of the crowd. I did several low-cost days aboard a floating hotel through the CDC (Cairns Dive Center). The staff was knowledgeable, the food was plentiful (nothing fancy, but lots of it), the other divers were from all over the world, and the diving was great! The bad new is -- no where else is ever as exciting again.
