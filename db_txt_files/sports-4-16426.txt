Jake Delhomme has taken the Panthers to a Super Bowl, which is something that most quarterbacks can't claim to have done. I don't know what it is, but his winning percentage as a quarterback has to be pretty good. He might not have a star quality, but there aren't many QB's I would want over Delhomme right now.
