This is one of my favorite children's books of all time. I think almost every little girl wanted to be Pippi Longstocking. She lived by herself in some really cool house, she went treasure hunting, she was rich, her dad was chief on a tropical island, and she got to wear those funky stockings. She is also a great role model. She's smart, creative, a total individualist, and very kind-hearted. This will definitely expand the imagination of a child.
