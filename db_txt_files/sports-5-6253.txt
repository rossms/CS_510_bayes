UNC 2005 National Champs. Duke was lucky to beat us at Durham because the clock ran out before we took a shot. We rolled over a lot of teams including the Fighting Illini for the NC at St. Louis. Take that Puke. Update: UNC is 6-1 and the crazy thing is, they lost practically the whole team from last years NC team. USC is up next. GO TARHEELS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Update, What happened UNC? How could you lose to Southern Cal? Well I guess things like this happenes when you lose practically all of your team from last year.
