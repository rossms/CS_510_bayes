Must be in the top 10. I was fortunate to have had the opportunity to see #56 perform numerous times. He is the only defensive player to single-handedly transform opposing offensive strategy, not for one game, but permanently. He made bad teams respectable and good teams great. His will and determination were unmatched. He was Lawrence of the Meadowlands and LT to many. I just think of him as the best.
