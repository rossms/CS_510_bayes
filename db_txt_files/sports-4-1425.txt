How can you not love Boomer? He doesn't take himself too seriously, likes to drink, loves to eat, and gets batters out. When he was traded to the Blue Jays, most thought that Clemens was the gem in the trade and that Wells would have broken down by now. Well, it couldn't have turned out any better for Toronto. Nevertheless, I won't be surprised if he falters a little bit in the second half. He has already pitched a lot innings and may begin to tire.
