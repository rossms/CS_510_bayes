*EDIT* Personally,I'm not a fan of disturbingly violent video games.The exception being Silent Hill. The Gamecube has a lot of titles that I find very quirky.Paper Mario:The Thousand Year Door,Lost Kingdoms,and Animal Crossing among them. I still like the design of the controller. Again,feel free to disagree.
