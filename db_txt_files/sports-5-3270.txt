Joe DiMaggio is remembered as one of the game's most graceful athletes - a picture player both at bat and in center field. Many rate his 56-consecutive-game hitting streak in 1941 as the top baseball feat of all time. 'The Yankee Clipper used an unusally wide stance in winning two batting championships and three MVP Awards. In 13 seasons he amassed 361 hoemruns, averaged 118 RBI annually and compiled a .325 lifetime batting mark. At baseball's 1969 Centennial Celebration, he was named the game's greatest living player. Joe DiMaggio was inducted into the National Baseball Hall of Fame in 1955.
