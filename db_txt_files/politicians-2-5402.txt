It's hard for me to put a finger on exactly why I don't like this guy. Is it his stiffness? The fact that he comes across as a know-it-all? Or maybe that he seemed to be a real jerk in his debates with Bradley? Maybe his shocking lack of judgement (claimed that he invented the Internet, ordered the level of a river raised during a drought for a photo shoot of him on a boat). It bums me out more than a little that I'm not even somewhat interested / inspired / intriqued / impressed / intimidated by / or respectful of either candidate for the presidency. At least Clinton was smart, charming, and interesting.
