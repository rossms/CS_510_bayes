A great game with great graphics and gameplay. It offers over 100 hours of play, if you choose to go so far like me. There are sub-levels to play, too. It's a must have for your Gameboy, but after you fight all the trainers there's not really anything else good to do except catch pokemon or fight the Elite Four or maybe wait until a trainer calls you back, which can be awhile.
