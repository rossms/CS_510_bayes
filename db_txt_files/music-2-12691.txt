This isn't worthy of being listed as high as what it is. This is their worst album I gave it away I was so dissappointed in it. If you need this to complete your outkast collection fine, but if you just want the good songs from off of this cd, Outkast does have a best of collection. Other than this one ( haven't heard big-bois part of their latest cd) the rest of Outkast music is outstanding!
