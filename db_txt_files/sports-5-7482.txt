Nobody has the right to say that Charles Barkley was overrated. At 6' 4 1/2 and able to do what he did. Namely pulling down 11.7 rebounds and scoring 22 points a game. He never played great Defense and had a avg. outside jump shot. Minus having Kevin Johnson as his point guard while at PHO. He never had the great Point to pass to him. Unlike Malone/Stockton connection. During his prime he was the best power forward of all time.
