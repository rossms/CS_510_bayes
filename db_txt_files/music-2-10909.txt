Another 14 year old who wants to talk and sing about love. What else is new? At least Britney and Christina are older and better looking, not to mention hotter singers. With all the new girls out there it is hard to tell who is who, but I am tired of hearing young chicks like herself talk about relationships, love, etc. Isn't that illegal in most states? Almost sex with a minor like.
