I've tried alot of other fast Mexican places and always conclude that Taco Bell is superior (this is not including sit-down restaurants tho). Good, cheap and relatively healthy: what more can you ask for?. If you limit the cheese and meat TB is actually pretty healthy. I always get bean burritos and tostadas minus the cheese.
