What an interesting CD. Not pure hip-hop, not R B, not reggae, not spoken word, but kind of a combination of all four. There are some nice, original melodies to some of these tracks - something which seems to rare in hip hop these days. Unlike a lot of other artists in this genre, Wyclef can actually sing, and he takes full advantage on tracks like 911 and Pullin' me In. It Doesn't Matter is more of a catchy, rap anthem kind of song (featuring The Rock), but still very good. If you are looking to try something different, I would recommend that you take a listen to this CD.
