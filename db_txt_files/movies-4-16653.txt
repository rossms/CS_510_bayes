I just rented this movie. It is about Iris Murdoch a writer from Britain who gets Alzheimers disease. They cast two sets of actors to play Iris and her devoted husband. Kate Winslet and Hugh Bonneville were both good as young Iris and John, and Judy Dench and Jim Broadbent were excellent as Iris and John in their older years. I loved how they showed the devotion Iris husband showed her when she showed all the symptoms of alzheimers disease.Nicely done movie well acted.
