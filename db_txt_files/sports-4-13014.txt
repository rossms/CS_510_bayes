NC State may be a team on the rise in 2002. Philip Rivers is back at QB, where he tossed 16 TDs and completed 65% of his passes last year. RB Ray Robinson is gone, but Cotra Jackson looks promising as the starter in 2002. The talent, depth, and experience at WR is strong. Both lines need experience, and linebacker Dantonio Burnette needs more help. The secondary looks good and is led by Rams star Torry Holt's brother Terrence. Coach Chuck Amato is solid and make good decisions. This could be 2002's version of Maryland, a sleeper ACC team that got into the BCS.
