I love this bike! It's not quite a racer or a tourer and defintiley not a curiser. But of the 5 motorcycles I've owned this one is by far the most fun. Its handling is wonderfully neutral and superb through the twisties. I love the H-D engine sound and torque. Add an aftermarket muffler for even more of same. Mine is a 1997 S3 and the newer models are only better.
