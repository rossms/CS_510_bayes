Exciting but overwhelming city. There are a lot of people who can't abide the idea of New York not being #1 in every single thing, I've met a lot of people from there who haven't lived there in 30 or 40 years, and they ALMOST ALWAYS have an almost pathological need to say everything in NYC is automatically better. A lot of braggarts there (especially Yankee fans!) and the pace of life there is mind-numbing. Conversely, there really is an incredible amount to see there, and many of the people there are actually quite warm in spite of the city's reputation.
