The best RPG game I have played. The full scope of the game is amazing. By offering so many side quests and items it is rich for advanced users to explore and offers marvelous replay value. For those new to RPGs it is simple enough to learn and manage. Offering a unique and vivid world to go along with an interesting but sometimes dull story. One of the few RPGs that can be played many times but still have a crisp feel to it.
