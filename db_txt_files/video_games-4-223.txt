This game is great for Star Wars fans. It brings to life the racing that was in the movie. I like how it shows the many different arenas to race in. Although, it is hard to maneuver and get control of the vehicle at first, you will get the hang of it with constant play. The graphics are great and you get a feel for the racing.
