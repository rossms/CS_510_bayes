This is a really good action movie. As long as you're not expecting an innovative, unpredictable plot, accurate history, or first-class dialogue, you should be all set for a couple hours of quality escapism. The major battle scenes are especially impressive. And Russel Crowe is perfectly cast as Maximus, although I don't quite understand why a guy who's supposed to be from Spain speaks with an Australian accent. This movie definitely passed my bathroom test (i.e., I didn't want to miss anything by leaving for the restroom, so I was in severe pain by the end of the movie).
