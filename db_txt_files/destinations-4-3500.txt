Easton has a good vibe since it is right outside of Jersey and 76 miles from NY. There's always an influx of people coming in and out for business. The NYers who have moved to Easton have established a pretty good arts scene. There exist a lot of galleries. The city has a lot of nice old historic houses. It is also the home of Boxing Champ Larry Holmes. He has done a lot for the city in terms of redevelopment. On the downside a lot of people from Easton are ignorant clutzes! If you can ignore some of the wackos who live in Easton you'll be alright.
