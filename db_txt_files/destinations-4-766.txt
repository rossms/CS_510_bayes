Oh come on. Has anyone noticed that many of the same people who whine about political correctness seem to think that it's "politically correct" to bash Canada? There's nothing wrong with Canada. It's a perfectly fine country. Lots of Americans seem to want to impose their own American ideals on the Canadians, who see things differently. I can't even begin to imagine how hard it must be to sit on the same continent as one of the richest and most powerful country in the world.
