Pretty good school, but if youre not a fan of large universities, this definitely isnt for you. Great school spirit, nice campus, up to date technology and if you desire Greek life (fraternies, etc.), then youre in heaven. The main downfalls are the location (central pennsylvania can be so boring and cold) and the large class sizes (i was in a class of 1,000 my first year). But overall, a solid state university.
