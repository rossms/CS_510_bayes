This thing is small - I mean really small, and it's cool to be able to choose your color. As a music freak, I need something that holds more than 1,000 songs, but i would imagine that for most people 1000 songs is plenty. Just like with the 20Gb iPod, you will pay a premium for buying a iPod Mini as there are definitely MP3 players that offer better storage/$ - what you are paying for with the iPod is the compatibility with iTunes, which offers the biggest selection of music in the business, and Apple's superb engineering and technical support. For me, this is well worth the 40% or so price hike.
