It's hard to rate the Olsen twins separately as they have pretty much worked as a team all these years. Ashley's acting may be a tad more contrived than Mary Kate's (though still pretty good), but what I have written about Mary Kate, goes almost ditto for Ashley. I still believe these young women to be some of the better actresses of recent years.
