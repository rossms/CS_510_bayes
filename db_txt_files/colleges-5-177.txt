As a graduate student from South America, UM allowed me to grow as a human being and as a working person by allowing me to study with a diverse, motivated and intelligent student population. The faculty in the MIBS program had the academic credentials and the goal of developing students ready to succed in today s business world. The internship experience allowed me to enter a business sector in which I still work in my home country.
