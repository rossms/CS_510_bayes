This book is a must read simply for the cultural education. It is most enlightening what the world of a geisha is all about. I did not like the ending at all. The story itself is OK but nothing spectacular. I saved a quote from this book that I loved: Hope is like a hair ornament. Little girls wear too many, and old women look silly wearing even one.
