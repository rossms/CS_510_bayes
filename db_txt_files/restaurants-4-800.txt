I like the way they have expanded their menu and their choice of bread over the last two or three years. The Teriyaki Chicken sandwich is fast becoming my favorite, but a good old six inch meatball with olives and onions is still on my list occasionally. Yeah, the prices have gone up some, but it's still a good bargain compared to some other places.
