This was certainly humorous, but not as much as the first half-hour of Saving Private Ryan. The wacky(unfunny) Farrelly(Spelling? Who cares)Brothers really sat down and took about 5 minutes to copy already used material(farts,lax. gag, falling down,etc.). I give the two morons credit. Jimmy Carrey was still kind of original in this. Jeffy Daniels could've done better. At any rate, it sucked! When John Candy died, we got the Carreys Farrelly's of the desperate comedy world...ouch...
