I used this program for years, but finally "upgraded" to a computer which would not support MYM. MYM is a very good, basic, money tracking and managing system. The key word here is "basic". The modern money managing software tries to be all things to all people and usually fails causing frustration to the poor user. If only MECA would upgrade the Managing Your Money software to run on the modern Windows Operating Systems. Not upgrade the function, mind you, but only the ability to operate in today's environment. I'll be first in line to buy the "new" version. A.J. Risser Watertown, WI
