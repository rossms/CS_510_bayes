Definately the Capital of Europe and the Mediterranean! It is a great city full of life. Spaniards know how to have fun. Come here and you will not be disappointed. Many people whine about their purses got stolen or something like that, but that can happen in any big city and its just a matter of bad luck, so don't judge a whole city just on bad experience.
