I was disappointed in the movie. I was really looking forward to see it because the previews made it look so good, and I really like Jennifer Lopez...but the movie really didn't deliver. There was some cute moments, but it seemed like the movie was thrown together too quickly. If you want to see all the best moments just watch the previews.
