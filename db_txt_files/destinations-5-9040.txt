Not expecting much, I traveled to Great Zimbabwe from Harare and stayed overnight. I was impressed with the amazing construction and design, though surprised at the actual size, as it appeared much bigger on the Zimbawean currency! The bungalow-like Great Zimbabwe Hotel is quaint and also worth a stop.
