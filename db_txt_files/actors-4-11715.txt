I just read a newspaper article about Renee Zellweger, and the author made a good point: she's not beautiful in a way that knocks you out when you first look at her; instead, she has some kind of quality that gradually grows on you. Eventually you get hooked. She was great in Jerry Maguire, where she projected exactly the kind of earnest, genuine charm her character needed. And since she's set to star in a bunch of upcoming movies, I guess we'll see if she has what it takes to become a major movie star.
