Anyone that gave Coach Tiller 1 star should take a closer look. As soon as Tiller took over, Purdue went from bottom feeders to consistently contending at the top of the Big 10. How many coaches take over a non-bowl team and make them 8-3 in their first year as coach? One Big 10 championship in 2000 and a 2nd place finish and Capital One Bowl two years ago makes him a pretty good coach in my book. To make my final point, Purdue is one of only about 8 teams in the nation to go to a bowl game for the last 8 years in a row.
