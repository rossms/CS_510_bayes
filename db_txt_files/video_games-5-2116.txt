Perfect Dark is a total package. In comparison to Goldeneye 007, PD had all the elements Bond was missing. Aside from more guns it had SIMS and the ability to play alone or with other people. The fact that you could manipulate any detail was cumbersome at first, but the advanced player soon found it simple and enjoyable. Attention to detail was superb as well as bonus levels being given. I bought it the day it came out and still play it five to six times a week.
