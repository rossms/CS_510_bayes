These are wonderful bookstores - large enough to get lost in and they carry just about anything that may interest you. With their huge floorspace, comfy chairs and coffee shop I would also say they cater to the serious browser. We're finally getting one on my side of town and I couldn't be happier about it. At last, something that does not involve hardware, discount shopping or greasy fast food - now, that's entertainment!
