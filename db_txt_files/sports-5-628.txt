One of the most consistent pitchers of the past 15 years. Until a couple of years ago, he was a lock for 15 wins and a sub 3.00 ERA. He's a bit older now, but the Professor is still as wily as they come. He doesn't rely on the strikeout as heavily as say, Pedro, the Big Unit, or the Rocket, but he gets guys out any way he can. With 300 victories in the books, he has his ticket waiting for him in Cooperstown. Seems to be a fairly humble and down-to-earth person, something sorely lacking in professional sports today.
