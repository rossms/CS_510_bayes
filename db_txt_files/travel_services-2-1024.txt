The crew who moved us from NY to TX were personable but arrived late to pack our belongings, rushed through the job, we had to help them in order to finish on time. Then, we arrived in TX and found that things were missing (including a lg. asst. of antique newspapers), the legs of a antique sewing table were broken, a new stain was on a table. We had insurance but the deductible precluded filing a claim. Awful!
