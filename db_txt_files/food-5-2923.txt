I love the Milano cookies. I have tried Milk Chocolate and Raspberry and Raspberry is DEFINITELY my favorite! I noticed that my store is carrying SOME flavors in a Mini Milano - where 5 small cookies is one serving! I would LOVE to find the raspberry in the mini cookies! I would recommend these to anyone. They are not too sweet - yet sweet enough! GREAT!!
