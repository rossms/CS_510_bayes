I would really give James Cagney a 4.5. I have not seen too many of his movies but the ones I have seen he was great in. I especially liked him in Yankee Doodle Dandy, where he played George M. Cohan. He showed that not only was he a good actor, he is also a great dancer. He did an admirable job in the movie The Man with a Thousand Faces portraying Lon Chaney. he was good in Love Me or Leave Me too.Even though he was known for his tough guy roles, he has proved himself good in other types of roles.
