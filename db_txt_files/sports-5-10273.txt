Although I will admit that I am relieved to be winning the OU-Texas game regularly for now, our continued lack of response to offensive adjustments by our opponents has showed Mr. Stoops' arrogance and achilles heel. The losses to Okla. State in 2001 and 2002 as well as the let down to Alabama and loss to Texas A M will (and should) haunt Stoops for as long as his tenure at Oklahoma lasts (which might not be much longer!).
