I gave Clinton one star under the presidents listing. Suffice it to say, his dismal record and dearth of constructive ideas each speaks for itself. However, I must upgrade his rating slightly for the politicians category. Clinton, though morally and mentally bankrupt, is, without question, one of the smoothest politicians we will see in our lifetimes. His fundraising ability is through the roof (Democratic party faithful still by and large like him), and he knows how to work a crowd. Sorry, Mr. Clinton, but that's about all I have to say positive about you.
