Yeah, I have been a SunChip fan for quite a while. I believe it began when I thought I was enjoying a snack that may actually be somewhat healthy?! I am not so sure that is true..maybe they are a bit better than other snack foods..but I am quite sure they are not really Good for me..Either way, they are crunchy, tasty, not greasy and taste great along with a sub.
