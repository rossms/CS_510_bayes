Sometimes I'm really in the mood for Hot Tamales, especially the extra hot ones. They have quite a bit of zip and are pleasantly chewy. (If you are unfortunate enough to get a stale box, however, discard it immediately unless you want to have some serious dental work done. I suspect that stale Hot Tamales could double as bullets.) When I was in college, a friend of mine introduced me to her favorite Hot Tamale recipe- tossing a box of Hot Tamales with a tub of buttered popcorn. I have to admit it was a tasty combination! I don't eat many Hot Tamales these days, but when I do, they really hit the spot.
