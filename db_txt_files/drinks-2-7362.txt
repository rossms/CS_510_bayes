I like my vodka to be able to stnd by itself straight up or in a vodka martini. Man, does Smirnoff have a bite to it. Take one sip of Smirnoff straight up, and it's got a recoil mechanism to it, kind of like a large-caliber rifle. If all you're going to do is mix it with tonic or fruity stuff, though, it will suffice.
