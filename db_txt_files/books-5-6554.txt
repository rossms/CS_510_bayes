Robert Stanek introduces a world and characters unlike any others I've read ever. The story is great read and I kept turning page after page. There's a whole cast of characters that are richly detailed and real. Adrina is grieving over a tragic loss. Vilmos is always getting in trouble. Valam is fierce yet gentle, a prince in all aspects. Xith is mysterious and supernatural. Seth has strange elvish abilities. In addition to loveable characters, Keeper Martin's Tale has a great plot and strong dialog. It all rings true and seems as if it could happen.
