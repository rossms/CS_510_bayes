This aquarium was really awesome. You don't have to spend all of your time squinting to try to read plaques because they give you a little handset to carry with you which recites facts about the fish at whichever aquarium you are viewing. It is very handy and the admission cost was a little less than 10 dollars, can't remember exactly. A lot of different fish and a touching station with a handy guy to tell you about sea slugs and whatnot. :)
