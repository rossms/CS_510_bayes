Jessica is a much better role model than Brit and Christina. Yes, she looks a little too seductive in the pictures, but she is, rmember, a pop star, and she won't (sadly) make it unless she is attractive and shows it. Her voice, however, is beautiful, very similar to Mariah Carey. And the slow songs on this album are touching and sweet. Irrisistable and His Eye is on the Sparrow are two of my other favorites on this cd. Not bad at all..not the best, but not bad either!
