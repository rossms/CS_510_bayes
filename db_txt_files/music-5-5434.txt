The definition of a rock/metal band: Black Sabbath. The definition of a rock/metal album: Paranoid. In just twelve days and without studio gimmicks,the good old boys from Sabbath one of the most brillantly pieces of music ever made. War Pigs, Iron Man, Paranoid, Electric Funeral: the names of the songs themselves say greatness. All the kings studio wizards, and all the kings studio gimmicks of modern day couldn't come close to making a masterpiece like this again.
