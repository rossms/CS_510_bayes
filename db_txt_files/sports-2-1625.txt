Let me first say that Everett is a damn good baseball player. Over the past couple of years, he has gotten a chance to play every day and he has been one of the better hitters in baseball. However, he is also one of the biggest assholes in baseball. He believes that the world is against him, contends that dinasours never existed (because he never saw them), and rants about how overrated some players and teams are (specifically, Jeter and the Yankees). It is great to see that his explosion at an umpire and subsequent 10 game suspension could cost the Red Sox a post-season spot.
