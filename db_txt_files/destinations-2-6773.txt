I really think South Dakota is just a big waste of space. It should be called THE GAP. The cities are dirty, and they aren't even that big. The Black Hills area, which was once Native American land is now ruined because of the abuse of tourists, and the traffic in that area during tourist season is unexcusable and disgusting. I mean there are a few good spots, but they are few and far between. And the people are so horribly close minded. You should just visit Wyoming, a much better place right next door to the west. :)
