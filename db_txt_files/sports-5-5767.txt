what Jackie brings to the table is crucial for any team that has hopes of winning big. We could only beat the most lowly of cupcakes without him. Not to bring up sad thoughts or anything, but I will probably cry on senior day this year. That's how much Jackie means to the team and to the fans. What a great kid, man. He deserves to go out a winner.
