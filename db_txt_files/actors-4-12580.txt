i have always liked Mary Tyler Moore. I know she has done some movie roles. but I know her most from tv. I loved her work in both the Dick Van Dyke show,and the Mary tyler Moore show. I think she is a good actress. I have seen her in different types of roles and she is a convincing actress. I must admit since i have ususally seen her in roles where she plays a good person it is harder to see her play a bad guy but that is just my opinion.
