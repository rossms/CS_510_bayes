You know. I enjoyed Titanic but i don't think that this is enough to classify him into a steriotypical catigory which we call a Fantastic director. I say he is good, but not great. But he has many movies he has under his belt that i love to watch such as True Lies The Terminator and it's sequals and of course the abbyss, which was a major contribution into the world of CGI. James Camron is good. But not great
