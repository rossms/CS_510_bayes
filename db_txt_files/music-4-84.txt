Doesn't quite make the 5 category.....a few missteps (I never was a fan of Sidewinder Sleeps Tonite and Ignoreland). But the two songs that close this record--Nightswimming and Find the River--you could not ask for two more breathtaking pieces of music. I love those songs, and the hits are not that bad either, although killed a little from overexposure (Everybody Hurts, Man on the Moon, Drive). Star Me Kitten is a perverse delight as well.
