I really enjoyed my 2 trips to this restaurant. The first was for Cinco de Mayo and I had this awsome frozen margarita/sangria swirl. They come in 2 sizes- large and mega huge- so be careful if you are the designated driver. The second time I had the beef fajita with black pepper. It was very good. Not authentic mexican, but the chips and salsa weren't bad.
