I actually enjoy the taste of Grape Nuts much more than sweeter cereals. They have substance and, like oatmeal, also stick with you longer than the average air-filled cereal. If they remind you of that old SNL skit about Quarry cereal - just try leaving the milk on them about 2 minutes before eating them and you will find that they tend to soften up a bit. Also good with milk and heated in the microwave a few seconds.
