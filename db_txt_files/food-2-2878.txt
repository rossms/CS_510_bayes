I am a milk chocolate conoisseur. Godiva milk chocolates (not their dark) are so overrated. They have a hazlenut taste to them, which imparts a certain flavor to all their milk chocolate based products. The BEST milk chocolate I have ever tasted, ironically, would be a product from Greece called 'LACTA'. Absolutely creamy and tasty beyond belief!
