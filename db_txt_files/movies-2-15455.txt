My first mistake in going to see this movie was paying attention to all the buzz and expecting it to be some amazing Academy Award worthy flik (which it isn't). Second mistake (to no fault of my own) was thinking it was some light-hearted coming of age tale. Don't let the previews deceive you. The underlying story lines that involve incest and abortion are quite disturbing. Its a too bad that Homer thought he was better than the orphanage because the movie would have been much better had he just stuck around and played with all the cute kids.
