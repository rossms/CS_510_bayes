This team has great fans. Players who will blossom into dangerous forces, like Okafor and May. And then they have the money to get a big scorer to help them out. They are upbeat and cheerful around there. The main drawback for the 'Cats is that they are way too young. Get a veteran on the team. A good veteran, not some washed up fool. Teach the youngsters. Now you've got the winning team. I definitely feel like they'll get it together and be the hottest team out there in a couple of years.
