World Series records are good but somewhat padded because the Yankees basically dominated the rest of the American league during Yogi's career. But Yogi was a classic ballplayer. . .and the funniest. My favorite quote- a reporter asked Yogi what went wrong when the Yanks lost a World Series he shook his head and replied: We made too many wrong mistakes.
