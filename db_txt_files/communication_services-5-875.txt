Ratings are one thing. It has been proven that most people who share their comments is only when they have bad experiences. I have been with Rogers, Fido, Bell and Telus Mobility. Each company has something to offer. I am currently with Telus Mobility and I appreciate the service and equipement. Client care services are up to standards and in most situations are excellent. To those who can only complain, get a life!
