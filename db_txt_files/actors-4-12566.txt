Julia Stiles is one of the up and coming actresses. The first time I saw her was in 10 Things I Hate About You. She was really pretty and played the part really well. She was tough, funny, witty and intelligent. Since then, I have seen more of her in magazine interviews and on MTV interviews. She seems very down to earth. She is in the new movie State of Main and then the movie coming out soon called, Save the Last Dance. I look forward to seeing what she has to offer but she is off to a good start.
