1st of all the product itself is awesome which I would give a 5/5 for the taste and sizes. However, what makes me not give a 5/5 overall is that when I go to some inefficient burger kings and they serve you cold stuff and/or treat you like a homeboy (for example: ya?, Coke?, $6.55!..... (10minutes) Next-ya?,coke?,$6.55!.....). I think that they have a great product, but eventhough it is hard, they should work on their service (like all other franshises).
