George Bush will be remembered forever in American history; not because of the controversy that surroundes his military service, the temporary economic decline, or his inability to pronounce certain words. George Bush will be remembered for leading his country in a time of need, standing strong against the evil in Iraq, and resisting the temptation to make love to his intern in the oval office.
