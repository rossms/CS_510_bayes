BT is quickly becoming one of my favorites. I cannot fault the guy for wanting to try a little variety. For most music artists it is bound to happen. There are a couple of songs on the album i just can't get into, but the rest of the cd is pretty awesome. I like Dreaming, Godspeed, and although i didn't like it at first, Never gonna Come Back Down has kind of grown on me. I think its the funky lyrics....English girls with ghetto names....That just boggles my mind.Anyhoo, i do play the cd more often than i should, so i give it 4 stars.
