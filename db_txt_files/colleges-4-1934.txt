Very good school with a fast-paced urban atmosphere. There's not much in the way of a campus, so people looking for a place that has trees and a quad should look elsewhere. Great accessibility to Boston and a top-notch nightlife scene. Because it's located in the heart of the city, there are a lot of employment and internship possibilities. Finally, the hockey team is incredible and provides bragging rights in a perennial fashion with the Beanpot tournament.
