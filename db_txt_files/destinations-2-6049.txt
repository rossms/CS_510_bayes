AZ is a hot and dry place to live- Prescott is high enough for snow and a less extreme climate. A state growing this fast needs an adequate water supply and decent infrastructure to support this kind of frantic growth- it has neither. A hot climate growing hotter in years to come with no water- a recipe for disaster- good luck.
