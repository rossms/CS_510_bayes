This movie was VERY good for it's time and has a good soundtrack, the problem is that it may not be able to stand the test of time. Many of the stars were the flavor of the month, and were never regarded as serious actors (e.g. the two Coreys .), and other characters have either floundered in their careers or disappeared entirely. Problem is that the vampire-teen angst genre just won't hold up over the long term, (i.e. when teens are going Goth anymore). It was hip, cool, and funny, but it was also very 80's. I enjoyed it then, and I enjoy it now, but don't know if I will later.
