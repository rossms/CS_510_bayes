Great movie with some good dancing. I liked the plotline about a 17 year old and her family at a vacation resort. baby meets Johnny a dance instructor. Alot of good music. Jennifer Grey and Patrick Swayze were both good as the leads. I was surprised to see how good of a dancer Parick Swayze was.An enjoyable movie.
