This is a great board game. It's incredibly easy to learn, so you don't have to spend a lot of time teaching new people to play, but there is still a lot of strategy that you can come up with, similar to checkers. I remember the ad for this game when it came out as being A minute to learn, a lifetime to master, which is a pretty true slogan.
