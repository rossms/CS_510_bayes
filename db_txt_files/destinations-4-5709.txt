I lived here for a few years. It's trite but true--Minnesotans really are some of the nicest people around. I think their warmth almost makes up for the frigid weather 6-8 months of the year. Winter can be unbearable, but there's always something going on to make it more livable (car races on the frozen St. Croix River, for one). The Twin Cities is one of the cleanest metro areas on earth, and I like those blonde-haired, blue-eyed women of Scandinavian descent.
