we moved from courtice to oshawa on august 28/04. we moved with the oshawa branch of two small men,and found the men to be completely professional and courteous. they did everything we asked and more. If our family ever moves again, you betcha,I will be calling these guys. I only wish I could have tipped the men more. thanks again bernie and angela
