i just quit tim horton's in sault ste. marie ontario. it is the worst run business i have ever seen the employees are streated like crap because management thinks they are god and we should bow down to them. so if you have a serveer from tim horton's in a bad mood it is because they are tired of being treated like slaves and need a new job but have not found one yet.
