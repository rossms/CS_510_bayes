I have always rooted for the Wolverines (since they are the school in their conference who can beat the Buckeyes)...However losing to the Crying Irish and eeeking out a win at home against a perenial power, such as the San Diego State Aztecs give me a break. They are lucky to have been ranked as high as they were to start the season or they wouldn't even be in the top 25...Go Trojans (USC) that's the University of Southern California not the university of South Carolina and Granny Faust (Lou Holtz). Michigan if you want to be in the Rose Bowl this year I suggest you BUY your tickets now.
