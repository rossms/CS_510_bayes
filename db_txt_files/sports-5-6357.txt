Like a lot of people, I hate Duke while still respecting Coach K and the program. Say whatever you want, over the past ten years no college basketball team in the country has been more impressive than the Blue Devils. And their tournament record is insane. Here they are again in the 2001 Final Four, making a run at another championship. But magellan is absolutely right - year in and year out, there's something obnoxious about the demeanor of the Duke players that makes it impossible to like them. Coach K must have a weak spot for arrogant, snotty pretty boys.
