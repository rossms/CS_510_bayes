If you enjoyed The Sound of Music, Salzburg will have so much to show you. What's nice about Salzburg is that it is near Hitler's Eagles Nest, Herrenchiemsee Castle and Munich. You can do a lot of things in a short amount of time in and around Salzburg. It's a little like walking into the past. The historic district is very quaint.
