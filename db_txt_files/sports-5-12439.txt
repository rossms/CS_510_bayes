Everybody knows Florida St. is the toughest team to beat in college football next to Nebraska. I like them because the opponents they face have no chance. Bobby Bowden as a coach is great and he knows how to bring the talent out in people and pump fear into other teams' hearts. Which gives him an advantage over other teams.
