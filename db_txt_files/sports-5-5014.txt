The best vision of any college player, while dealing with maybe the toughest circumstances of any college player...he had to stay in the dorms on road trips because he wasn't allowed in hotels! Despite all of this he averaged over 33 a game for his collegiate career. Pistol Pete was good but I think the Big O had more factors to overcome to be great...and he did not have great teammates around him in college either.
