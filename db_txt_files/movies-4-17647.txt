Perhaps this was the first talkie film gold7714om ever saw and was therefore shocked to find out it was in Spanish and didn't understand any of it and that is why he/she describes it as dismal . I however disagree. I found it to be very entertaining and the amazing thing is when you see this film and other films by the Almodovar (the director) is how Antonio Banderas is actually a decent actor. In spanish films he actually comes across okay. However, I do agree with elsi729om that his wife is indeed a Hag
