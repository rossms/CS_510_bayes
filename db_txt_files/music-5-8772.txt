Let me get this out of the way. I in no way like Linkin Park. Well, until this song and video came out. This is the moodiest, loveliest, and most visually stimulating video to come out in a while. I love the use of the cold blues and blacks along with moving backdrop. Although the story within the video is a little hard to desern, it makes up for that with sheer effects which usually does not work but in the case of this video, does. Very slick and stylish. It conveys the mood very well.
