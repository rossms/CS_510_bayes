My December and Points Of Authority Remix are the best songs on this album. Its about time My December was included as they only had it on Hybrid Theory EP previously and that was a bit** to get hold of. My December is the original song. Points Of Authority is better than the original. However, i would not recommend getting this album for 2 songs, as the rest of this album is crap. All the songs are remixed terribly your best bet is getting the original, bypassing this one and getting meteora and collision course.
