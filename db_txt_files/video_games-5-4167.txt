NHL 2000 is truly the apex of computer hockey games. It has incredible graphics, immersive sound, enjoyable play-by-play, and with the patch, very challenging and realistic AI. All that, and a player editor that allows you to graft a picture of yourself onto a created player..allowing you to center for your favorite NHL team! It's easy to do, and it looks pretty darn good too. I really can't recommend this game highly enough. Trust me, you'll be impressed.
