A very underrated coach. His team competes year in and year out in one of the toughest conferences. The big rap against him is that he people see him as having more talent than anyone else, yet unable to do anything big with it. But, if you look at the NBA, how many superstar Syracuse grads have their been? Derrick Coleman? John Wallace? Look at Lawrence Moten.... One of Syracuse's all time leading scorers and as far as I know, he has never stuck with an NBA team. The facts speak for themselves - Boeheim takes good but not great talent and turns out a decent team year in and year out.
