What I find amazing about Lloyd Carr is that he let another quarterback beat him. You would think that after last year's disaster losing 3 out of 4 of your most important games because of a quarterbacks' ability, some adjustments would have been made this year. I believe that Carr is really a good guy but it is time for him to move into the office. The game is passed him by and his teams are no longer able to compete with speed. I believe this will be his last season.
