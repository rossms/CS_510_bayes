Always had a thing for her since I was child. She hasn't really put out any sensational performances but I thought she was really good in Married to the Mob. She did an great job in that. I hope she keeps doing well in the future. Nice thing about her, she is an easy bet that you are going to see a decent or good movie with average to above average acting.
