Seeing this movie about a pimp made me feel pimped, of about $8. Why did I listen to the critics and their rave reviews? why? A poor pimp decides to self-improve...so he becomes a rapper (!)...ahhhhhh! Totally predictable and not much to it. Obscenities, mysogynistic lyrics, cellulite, Lord's name in vain...with no redeeming value. I'd tell you the ending but you could probably guess it. Music kinda catchy, but not overwhelming, and lyrics stupid.
