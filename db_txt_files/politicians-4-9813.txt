He really wasn't a bad president at all. He was just a little weak. He couldn't have raised taxes without the support of the democrat controlled house and senate. I've been reading some info that says he was basically forced to do by the house and senate. He should never have lost to Clinton but of course the economy had to play a role. I also read something about the economy starting to improve the last year of his presidency. I hope his son does avenge him because if he's anything like his father and Reagan we'll be allright if he gets elected.
