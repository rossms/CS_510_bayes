They have very affordable very nice jewelry. Not platinum or anything I do not think, but they have sterling and gold through mail order and online. I have usedthem for a long time, and we are now using a ring from them as my wedding ring!! It has 8 CZ for diamond look, and we paid $40. I get complimented daily. It's completely not real diamonds! THey are a wonderful company and make no false claims.
