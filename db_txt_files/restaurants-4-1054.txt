I guess I'm in the minority here, but my eyes light up whenever I see an A&W during lunch hour. I think they are much better than the McDonalds and Burger Kings that litter the landscape. Plus the carhops are a great alternative to dining in. The coney style hot dogs, while not the best, are pretty good for a chain restaurant.
