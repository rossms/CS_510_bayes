The cities along the American border suck. But Puebla, Morelia, Quer taro, Guanajuato, Zacatecas, San Miguel de Allende, Taxco and Oaxaca are full of nice architecture ,history and tradition. Not everybody has a taste for Mexico City, but I find it superb. The archaeological sites are unique and the beaches are great.People are friendly
