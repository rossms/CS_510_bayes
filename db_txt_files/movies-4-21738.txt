I am a ver big lord of the rings fan. I read the book, many times, i saw all three movies, i wish that the had drawn it out into more movies. I think that the characters were well potrayed the action was great the weapons and scenery were breathtaking. My only problems were that strayed to far from the book at times, they never really showed what happened to sauraman, and they should have added the proper ending to the movie with the hobbits going back to the shire and having to reclaim it. In short it was excellent movie but in think they rushed the last movie of the three
