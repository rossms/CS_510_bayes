Excellent University! I transferred there from NYU, since I wanted a campus life and intellectual environment, and spent some of the best years of my life there. The professors were very engaging and top-notch, class size ratios were good, and the grading scales very fair. Seton Hall is considered a top University in the 'tri-state area', and probably one of the top 3 in the state of New Jersey after Princeton and Rutgers. SHU has garnered much respect over the years, and rightly so. I met some great people there as well. You won't regret being a student (and alumnus) at SHU!
