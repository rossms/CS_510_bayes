Who knew? Not me. This past weekend my mom and I went to a big Eddie Bauer store because she likes to shop there, which is exactly what I thought of Eddie Bauer, mom store but I was shocked to see their updated styles. The men's stuff still seems a little dad like but the women's stuff is really nice. They have really changed their image. I got some great stuff on sale. 3 shirts for $45. Really great deal.
