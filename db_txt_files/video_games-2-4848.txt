I really didnt like this game, story was boring as hell, the new warthogs and ghosts werent worth a damn, the guns werent as useful as in the original, the duel wield was useless, and they held hardly any ammu.After beating it two days after I rented it, I started playing Halo 1 and actually having fun. the only reason I gave it a 2 is because split screen was slightly better. Not Recommened.
