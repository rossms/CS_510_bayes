McCain is a real man and would make a good president. He is not a corporate puppet draft dodger like this disgrace W. I only hope he leaves the Republican party and becomes an Independent. Campaign Finance reform would give control of our elected servants back to the people. This is the last thing Republicans and most Democ-Rats want. W is a liar and a moron; how republicans could choose W over a war hero like McCain is beyond me. Repubs told us don't vote for a draft dodger like Clinton, but what did they do: voted for a tail between his legs National rich -boy Guard draft dodger W.
