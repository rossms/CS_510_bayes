This is the best Mario Party ever! there are 70 new mini games in it and they're fun. There are 2 new characters in this game Waluigi, and Daisy. and there are new board games in it. there are things from the 1st and 2nd MP like the Bowser space. and there is also a duel board where you can play against a computer player or your friend. This is the best game to play with your friends ever. it's better than the first two games. rent it or get it now. I reccomend this game to any partiers who like to play video games.
