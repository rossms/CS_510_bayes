I'm a Davidson student and think it is a wonderful college. Academics are so challenging that, although we work our butts off, the rewarding feeling after a semester leaves you proud and glad you pushed through it all. The reputation for being the college with the greatest work-load is no lie - you won't find many people who aren't swamped with work. Our un-official motto is work hard, party hard. Davidson students go all out in every way - academics, sports, organizations and clubs, partying....we give 100% to everything we do. It's a great place to be.
