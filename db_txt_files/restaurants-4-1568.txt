In Australia, the way KFC cooks it's chicken is less disgusting than the way McDonald's make its burgers. KFC's chicken tastes much better than McDonald's 'beef' and they're more likely to be served hot. KFC is overpriced and the burgers look fairly small, but KFC is almost always clean. I prefer KFC to McDonalds.
