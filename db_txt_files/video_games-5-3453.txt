Along with FF-X, my favourite game. Brilliantly structured characters with immaculate FMV sequences which seem almost impossible for such a system to accommodate. Wonderul score. I thouroughly enjoyed playing this game just to see what happened next. The ending still brings tears to my eyes. Perfection!
