On Christmas morning, the two best things Santa could leave in my stocking were 1) that big box of Crayola crayons, and 2) one of those big folding boxes of wild cherry LifeSavers. I distinctly remember running down the stairs on Christmas morning and almost turning a backflip when I saw those two things sitting next to each other in my stocking. And, while I never seem to buy LifeSavers anymore, I'll never turn someone down when they offer me a Wint-o-Green or Pep-o-Mint.
