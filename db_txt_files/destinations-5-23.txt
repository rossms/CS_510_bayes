Nairobi has all that a big city has to offer, from the wealthiest surbubs you can ever find in Africa to the poorest slums. I lived in Nairobi for a while and I honestly don't think it's as bad as most people tend to view it. Quite modern if you ask me, with tons of friendly people. Kenya is a great country to visit.
