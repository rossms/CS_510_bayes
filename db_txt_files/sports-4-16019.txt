Haven't seen him play too often with the Lions, but judging by what I saw with Texas and some of the numbers he had, he's probably the real deal. That juggling one-hand catch early in the season doesn't hurt his rating. On a side note: I'm not entirely sure which Roy Williams, since I could not find the Free Safety Williams anywhere, so I'll just put him in here too. Great tackler, but needs to learn how to cover somebody. Way to go Roy, hopefully you ruined the Eagles chances in the Super Bowl.
