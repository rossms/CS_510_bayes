This comment is for everyone who submitted a negative comment on Jesse Jackson. It is apparent to me that the people who submitted negative comments are not or have never read the BIBLE. Not one of us is RIGHTEOUS. We do not have the right to judge Jesse Jackson. Being a Christian, I am aware that we all make mistakes and GOD is the only one that can judge us. We all have done things that we are not proud of. Jesse is human just like the rest of us. For those of us that love CHRIST, we must love our fellow man the same way (unconditionally). Who says reverends are perfect.....
