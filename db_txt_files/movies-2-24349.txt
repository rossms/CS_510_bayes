The first two were great. This one is ruined by pushing Blade into the background. Wesley Snipes was really angry about them adding two other "sidekicks". Blade doesn't need sidekicks, the name of the movie is BLADE. Unfortunately Wesleys Snipes unhappiness shows on camera, he doesnt do much and he looks pretty bored. I heard he spent most of his time in his trailer smoking weed and they used a body double and cgi for many scenes.
