how can anyone not give him a 5. Like him or not, nobody can deny what he has done as a player and he is the undisputed player of the era, arguably the greatest of all time. Sure, he may be a jerk, but at least he's not a phony and it has nothing to do with his abilities and about the thing to honor the players the day after the world series loss, 20 other players didn't show up either, so don't play him. He gets it done when it matters too
