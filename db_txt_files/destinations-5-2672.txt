Chicago combines the amenities of a big city - great architecture, shopping, sports, public transportation, restaurants, theater, music, and art - with a surprising amount of the amenities of a small town - it's drivable, walkable, livable, and has acres and acres of green parks set along a stunningly pretty lakefront. The winters are bad, sure, but the activities just keep right on going. The crime rate is dropping, and there's a sense of energy here as the city continues to gentrify. Chicago may very well be the overall best city in the United States.
