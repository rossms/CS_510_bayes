Far superior to Nightmare Before Christmas (which I thought plain stunk). Corpse Bride is based on an old Russian fable and is visually refreshing, funny at parts, and a good way to fritter away a few hours. Though it focuses on the macabre, there was nothing particularly graphic or objectional for my children. If you like Burton, you'll definitely like this.
