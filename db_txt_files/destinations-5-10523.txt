Flat out the best cigarette I have ever smoked. Well, at least in the last 10 years. I used to be able to get, I think it's Gitanes, the wide french cigs (the type in Die Hard). Those are a real treat. But, Izmir Stingers. Very rich. Very strong. But they go stale quickly, so you might want to smoke the tin all at once rather than saving them for special times. If you like Turkish Royal and Filters, these will knock your socks off. I never rate anything five stars, but this, I'll make an exception.
