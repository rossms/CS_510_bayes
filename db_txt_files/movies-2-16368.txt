I'm glad I didn't have to spend any money on this one (I got a promotional tape)...the first part is not bad, but everything is spoilt by Helen Hunt's poor acting (did that woman really win an Oscar, sheeeesh!!!) and by a shocking, stupid, overemotional ending. I give it 2 stars instead of one because Kevin Spacey is an Actor with a capital A, as usual.
