I love this team - sure they aren't Final Four material (but they did make it to the Sweet 16 last year). The thing is that Miami had no basketball program a little over ten years ago and now they go to the Topurnament every year. Soon they'll have an on-campus stadium and things will really rock. Also they have some great young recruits - keep your eye on them!
