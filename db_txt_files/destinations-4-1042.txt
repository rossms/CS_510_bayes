This is one of the countries I am considering moving to if George W. Bush is re-elected. It'll be tough being away from my family and friends, but oh, well, you do what you have to do. At least I'll be able to speak the language, and Australia has a lot of novel animals like koala bears and kangaroos. I don't know much about the people there but they seem to be a lot like Americans, but with quirky accents.
