I thought Hattie McDaniel was the best actress in this film playing Mammy. Mammy, the black slave, keeps Scarlet, the white girl, under control and makes sure her white family never misbehaves. That's what I like about this film is that it gives the slaves of the south a portrayal of them as human beings.
