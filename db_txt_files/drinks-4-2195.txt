This herbal tea reminds me of apple cider with cinnamon (though with a lighter flavor and more crisp finish). It does contain apple and cinnamon, as well as pear juice, peppermint, lemongrass, rosehips, orange peel, lemon juice, and cane sugar. It has no caffeine, and 160 calories per 14 oz bottle (almost as sweet as soda). Very lively, refreshing taste!
