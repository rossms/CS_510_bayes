My family and I had a very moving experience at The Great Blacks In Wax Museum! The wax figures really bring our history to life. The icing on the cake was the outstanding giftshop. It offered a great selection of great afrocentric gift items (greeting cards, calendars, toys, music, etc.). In addition, the books, DVDs and other educational merchandise will help my family continue learning from our visit.
