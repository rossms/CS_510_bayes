Nick's a great post-player. He's got crazy moves downlow in the paint. He's got soft hands has incredible control of the ball. I think he'll do well in the NBA because of his experience. He's played w/ some NBA players in the summer cause of USA basketball I think if he uses that experience as a tool he'll be one of the most dominant rookie players in the NBA.
