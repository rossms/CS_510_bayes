Johnson proved that he was a good coach at 1-AA Georgia Southern, but he is proving that he is great at Navy. Recruiting at a service academy is a hard thing to do, but Johnson has done a good job of bringing in players that fit with his system and with the mission of the Naval Academy. Navy had a great bowl win this season, and is likely to continue their success in the future. If there is any doubt to how good Paul Johnson is doing as a coach, take a look at what Army has been through lately.
