This book fills two roles: action adventure and social commentary. The action serves to illustrate the concept of citizenship as an earned privelige. I heartily agree with the thesis postulated that 'one does not value what is given, only what is earned- the dearer the cost, the more one tends to value it'. Verhoven tried to use this concept as comedy relief in the movie and fell right on his egg-sucking-dog-liberal face. Mechanized Infintry ain't Robocop you commie goon!
