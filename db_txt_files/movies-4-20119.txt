The promoters for the Blair Witch Project turned a potentially good movie into a laughing joke. We spent the entire time anticipating a extremely scary part and then got disappointed because it never came, distracting us from the brilliance of the movie itself. You have to realize that the movie required attention, in the right mindframe it was a really good movie.
