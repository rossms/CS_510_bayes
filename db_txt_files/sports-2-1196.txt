Dude stikes out every 3-4 AB, carries a .277 AVG and has gone from 64-49-40-35 HR. The Cubs should be a better team without him and I expect him to crest the 150 K range with the O's. The pitchers will go right after him and he'll end up with less than 35 jacks. This guy would NEVER been mentioned if it weren't for roids.
