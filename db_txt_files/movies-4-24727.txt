Many people who have seen this film are purely disgusted by the fact that this is a piece of Cheese . Not so, it is simply an Indiana Jones type thriller starring a female. Granted she is built well, but don't knock the movie just cause you don't like her. The acting is good, the adventure is fine, the cars and scenery are great. The only real dissapointing parts of this movie were Jon Voight and when the film ended.
