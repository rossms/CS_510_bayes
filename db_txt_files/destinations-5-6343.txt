Ohio, its truly heart of it all. OK, I am biased, I have lived in Ohio my whole life (Toledo), and I truly find it to be one of my favorite states still. Cleveland, Columbus, and Cincinnati are all interesting in their own ways. While I will admit, there is a lot of farmland in this great state, if there werent any, no one in America would be eating as good as if they had them, so be grateful they are there. There are many great things about Ohio, and the people that dont agree, it would help if you opened your eyes, and actually looked around sometime....
