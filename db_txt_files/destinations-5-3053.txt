One of my favorite cities, even the tourist schlock. A cosmopolitan, exuberant place. I'm always surprised by how cold it is, even in August, and I never seem to dress warm enough. For those reviewers rating solely on the sexual preference of some the inhabitants, I am truly sorry. I'm straight, and I've found many a blue collar hetero hangout every time I've been in town. What's your problem.
