Reading the comments of Shroomwoman, I was thinking about changing my mind about the movie, because her comments rang true. But I have to say, I must have been in-the-mood because I liked the movie and found it funny. One does not have to be attracted by the looks of Jack Nicholson to appreciate the humor in the viagra scenes and the recovering patients attempt to climb the stairs before attempting the greater goal. I did wonder, however, what the stunningly beautiful Amanda Peet saw in him. Nicholson did a tremendous job, as did Diane Keaton.
