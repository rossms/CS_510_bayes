Monschau is a must see town in the Ardennes region. I was there a couple of times in the 1970's (admittedly, a long time ago), but I doubt that it has changed much since then. This was the town that Hitler specifically forbade the Germans to attack during the Battle of the Bulge, because it was such an architectural treasure. It is extremely picturesque - half-timbered houses, a river running through the town, flowers everywhere in season, quaint narrow streets. It's something not to miss. This is my favorite town in Germany (better than Oberammergau or Garmisch).
