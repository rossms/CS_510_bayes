Mike Ikes are my favorite candy. I love looking at the smiling faces of the two characters on the colorful box. The best part about Mike Ike candy is the firm outside and chewy center. I never get bored eating them because in each box there is a ton of variety. Mike Ike candy is colorful and eye appealing.
