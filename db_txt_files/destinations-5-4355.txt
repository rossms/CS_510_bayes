No one is supposed to admit to liking LA, but I don't care, I love it. Lot's of eye candy. ;) Malibu and Santa Monica are absolutely gorgeous. Weather is perfect. Everyone seems happy. Optimistic. Like living at Disneyland. I think a lot of people don't like it because it represents the American stereotype: no culture, self-absorbed, large rift between rich and poor, fast-food everywhere and ignorant to tha fact that every other city is bitching about them. A different type of snoberry than NY, and NY is louder and more obnoxious. But most people are kind-hearted and friendly in LA despite the sterotypes.
