I thought this movie was cool and interesting, and not at all what I expected. I went in expecting to see a biography of John Malkovich the actor, and was happily surprised by what I got. The storyline is downright odd; a loser puppeteer (John Cusack) discovers a portal into John Malkovich's brain which allows people to see the world through Malkovich's eyes for 15 minute spells. If this isn't weird enough, Cusack's wife (Cameron Diaz) uses Malkovich's body to have a lesbian affair with a co-worker of Cusack (who Cusack also lusts after). Not your typical movie...
