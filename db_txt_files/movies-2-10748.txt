I tried this out as a rental. Good thing because I only wasted about two dollars. It turned out to be stupid and predictable. A waste of some good actors talent. As a matter of a fact the only reason I rented this was because I liked some of the actors who were in it. this is along the lines of Mad Mad world. and Cannonball run. A who's who of stars. a race to win the big prize. too bad, it just is not funny.
