I have been a Netflix subscriber nearly since its inception. I was impressed at first, and I'm even more impressed after all of this time. Any DVD/Video rental service can provide the current 'hottest', most popular films. But Netflix has a huge selection of foreign and classic old films that is unparalleled. I believe that Netflix has even begun to produce DVDs of some foreign films that, although not released in this country on US Regional format, have a demand for a discriminating audience. Hooray for Netflix!!
