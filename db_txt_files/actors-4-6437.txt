Here is an incredibly talented actor who is doing work way under his potential. All you ever see this guy in is teeny bopper, don't take me seriously junk. He is however, one of the most real, believable, truthful young actors working in film today. When I listen to his lines I am shocked by their cheezyness, but even more shocked by his ability to say them in such a way they don't seem cheezy. The only reason I am not giving him five stars is because i am waiting to see him in something that matches his potential.
