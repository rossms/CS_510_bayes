I honestly don't know what it is that makes The Shining such a scary and somewhat eerie movie. I don't think it's Jack Nicholson screaming ..Here's Johnny.. or his devilish expressions. I think its definitely less to do with the visual and more to do with the mind The film plays with our imagination to see how far it has to dig to reveal our hidden scare factors such as abandonment, seeing and hearing things that we think are there, people who can tell who we are before we've even opened our mouths.
