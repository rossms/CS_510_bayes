This is THE BEST GAME EVER MADE! Why is Gran Turismo 2 above it. Though FF8 is good the storyline is no where near rivaling FF7's! Cloud is my hero! I'll bet he could kick anyone's ASS! The graphics on the game are good and the soundtrack I've been looking for for years! From the Pissed off people to the love story. This game cannot be ranked with other games. It is a GOD compared to them!
