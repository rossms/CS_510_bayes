Salt Lake City is one of many unique cities in the country. The mountains are spectacular and the nearby skiing is awesome. The city felt more clean and for the most part, there were friendly people there. I could raise my children there, Utah has one of the lower crime rates of the U.S. in violet crimes, murders, robbery, aggravated assults. There are strip clubs and bars for the adults, but the laws are more strict.
