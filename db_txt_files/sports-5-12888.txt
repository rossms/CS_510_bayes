Anyone who has the guts to tell me that Auburn, 10-0 and 7-0 in the SEC, shouldn't be allowed a place in the 2005 Orange Bowl can come over and kiss by big behind. Auburn has beaten not to mention dominated on all the games they have played in and out of the SEC. We have beaten LSU, Tennessee, and Georgia who were all at the time RANKED IN THE TOP TEN!!! Opposed to the nobody teams that Oklahoma and USC play. WAR EAGLE
