Hershey has such a stranglehold on the chocolate market, I do not understand why they can't seem to make a better product. Their chocolate has a very indistinct flavor. From the chocolate syrup for icecream to their Hershey chocolate bars, everything they make tastes the same! Their Hershey's kisses are perhaps my favorite of the lot...but I tend to only eat them when they are given to me as a gift. I never actually go out and buy them for myself.
