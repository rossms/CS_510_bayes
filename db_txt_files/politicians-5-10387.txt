To be fair, I'll concede he probably didn't deserve to be accepted at Yale based on his grades and SAT's. But he can make smart decisions, just as long as he is given good intelligience from his administration. The economy isn't his fault either -- it is Clinton's. I will keep electing him because I am a Texan and everybody else needs to follow his Christian example. Support our troops!
