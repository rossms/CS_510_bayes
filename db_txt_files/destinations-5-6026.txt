I have lived in AZ for 28 years and I love it.Phoenix is a craphole, but there are other beautiful places to live like Cave Creek . The Sonoran Desert has a unique and much to be appreciated landscape. It is hot, but we dont have hurricanes or earthquakes. The heat only lasts for about 5 to 6 months and the rest of the time it is perfect. I worked outside for 7 years and one summer pregnant, so quit complaining.
