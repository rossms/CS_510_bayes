I will be getting my 2003 Town Country this week. This is my 3rd one and I cannont think of a better vehicle in town or on long trips. We take 4 or 5 trips from Georgia to Mass every year and the Chrysler handles well and does not leave me tired after 8 hours of driving. The LXI is great for hauling stuff and I am also able to pull my pontoon boat on weekends to the lift. While I have no negative comments, I would like to see nicer leather seats and a few more interior things like floor storage, etc. BTW the back can haul a 4X8 whatever flat !
