Foxwoods has become a nice casino. It was one of the first built on an Indian reservation when it opened and has grown significantly since then. I was amazed by how much bigger it had gotten. I happened to go the night it opened and then returned for the first time a couple of years ago and it was if it wasn't even the same place. There were restaurants, hotels, and many more gambling tables. It's also only a couple of hours from both Boston and NYC making it easily accessable.
