Of all the electronic chain stores Good Guys will at least hire and continually train the sales staff. Want to know why to buy from commisioned sales? Buy something here and a like item at Best Buy. Try to return the item at each. BEST has NO customer service. The only bad marks that Good Guys gets is that it bullies it's sales staff with sales quotas which can cause some sales people to use high pressure to keep their job.
