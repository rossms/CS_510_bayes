I used to live in MA and went to CT a lot. Some nice small towns in the east part of the state but overall, this state is not very exciting. Hartford is and always will be a DUMP, end of story. People are rude and stuck up here, everything closes early, too expensive etc. Nice to visit in the Fall for the leaf peepers but other than that, not much else, i never would live n CT.
