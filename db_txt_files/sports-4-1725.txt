They are a hard luck team in a tough division. Lowe is having a bad ERA year and they can't score any runs for inconsistently heatlthy Pedro. Best hitting in the game, and now have a closer in Byun Yun Kim. If they make it to the offseason, they aren't going nowhere, because they will either play the Athletics (pitching could shut them down) of White Sox, who they could beat. But they have to have pitching to carry them the distance.
