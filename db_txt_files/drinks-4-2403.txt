A nice consistent cup of tea and very pretty packaging as well. They also offer a very wide selection of teas from Black Teas, to Herbals, to flavored teas so there is something for just about everyone. They are a little pricey though but I guess if you compare it to a pound of coffee and how many cups you get from that it really isn't that expensive at all.
