Tom Cruise is a pretty amazing actor. He is incredibly versatile (Risky Business, to Lestat in Interview with the Vampire). He seems to choose roles that are challenging and he conquers them and makes them his own. I thought he was great in Rain man and Magnolia is another one of his shining moments. He already has an excellent resume under his belt and I am hoping for many more stellar performances to come.
