Recently visited the coat department at Lord and taylor as I was shopping in the designer coat area, I had the pleasure of meeting a women by the name of Laurie. As I was looking through the coats, she came over and said 'I have the perfect coat for you'. Of course I though she was crazy, but she brought me over a great Cinzia Rocca cashmere coat.(Which fit to perfection). Not only was the assortment great but the help was even better. Two thumbs up to Lord and Taylor.Will always come back...Thanks Laurie.
