I think it is really too bad that I have to criticize a female leader. I think she could have been a great role model for future female leaders but this has not come true. Quite the opposite actually: she supported Pinochet and only got around to being a right wing fundamentalist. Thank the lord she is a goner and in spite of her own words the mummy will not return!
