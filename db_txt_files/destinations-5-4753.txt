A beautiful place. The mountains around the city are not only great to look at, but fun to climb. The people of Salt Lake City take pride in their lawns. The town is known for great ice cream parlors. And it's a place with a personality all its own. Do I agree with Mormonism? NO!!!! But it's still a great place to visit. We used to go there for our family reunions.
