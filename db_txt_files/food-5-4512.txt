Definitely a very tasty and unique cheese..do people eat it unbaked? I have never tried it..it is great baked, topped with fruit (raspberries) and puff pastry..or toss some brown sugar, butter, honey on top of it, wrap it in a pastry of your choice and bake, yum, yum, a quick, easy, affordable hors d oerve that will wow your guests..
