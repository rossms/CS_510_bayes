Sure he's big...but very timid and somewhat weak. The last Houston game against LA had Yao becoming Shaq's bitch. I'm sure that Shaq is quite a force to contend with...but to cower every time Shaq throws down the ball...and to cower when Kobe or Horry dunk the ball?? That's something I would expect from the likes of Shawn Bradley...not Yao. But he's young and I expect he will be excellent in a few years.
