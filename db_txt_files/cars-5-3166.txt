I drive a 98 4Runner and it is amazing for reliability, fuel mileage is poor. I will be installing a Airaid Helix coil to improve mileage and power. While serving in kabul as a Soldier I had seen these vehicles at work as a military light service vehicle and the abuse that they would take from soldiers and keep on trucking. This is what reinforced my decision to purchase this fine vehicle. My 4Runner has 175000 Km on it and Zero breakdowns. If you want a reliable vehicle buy a 4Runner. Money well spent
