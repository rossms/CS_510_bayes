The Ford Mustang is the last of its class. Comparing a Mustang to a import Japanese is probably the dumbest thing Ive seen. This a REAL sports car, unlike those 90hp VTEC engines. The Camaro was better, but its been canceled so the Mustange is in a class by itself. The V6 isn't that great, I'd go for the V8. If you have the money, Anaconda and SVT models are the best buys, with as much as 350hp. Lost a star for average reliability, but its not terrible like everyone thinks.
