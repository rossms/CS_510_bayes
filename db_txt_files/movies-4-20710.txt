i would really give this movie a 4.5, The actors are all good. Yul Brynner is wonderful as the king as well as Deborah Kerr. Most of the songs are good except for a couple that are boring. the movie is about a teacher who goes to Siam to teach the kings children.It is about the relationship they have.She is strong willed and they argue, It shows how the king grows to care for her.
