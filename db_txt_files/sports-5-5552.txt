Go ahead Ray. You have given us more than we can possibly ask for. You did not have to stay even two years so we appreciate al,l you have done. Do not worry about us. We will have a down year, probably like 18 and 12 or something, but we'll be great again in 06-07. We are champs so F it. Go increase our NBA dominance. I just hope the Bobcats know who people wanna pay to see, you know? Thanks Ray.
