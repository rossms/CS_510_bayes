Kind of like a Reeses peanut butter cup cookie style.We like the taste of this cookie with it's peanut butter middle and surrounded by chocolate. They are good from the freezer too. As I mentioned in Samoa's the thing I do not like is we get so few cookies. I am always willing to but Girl scout cookies and compared to other fundraisers $3.00 is not so bad for a box. I guess since there is a limited time to buy these cookies we could get a bit more in the box.
