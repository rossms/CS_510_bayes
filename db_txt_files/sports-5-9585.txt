Wow - I can't remember an NBA team that is more fun to watch than the 2004-05 Phoenix Suns. They are stacked with ultra athletic scorers who like to run the floor. Stoudemire is an absolute beast, and I don't think that Nash has made a bad decision all year long. These guys are playing basketball the way its meant to be played - if you haven't checked them out yet, I strongly recommend it.
