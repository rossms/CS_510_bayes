This movie was sick! Very disappointing because I like both Will Smith and Martin Lawrence. Lawrence's character was whiny and aggravating. Smith's character was violent and aggressive. A shame, because Will Smith looked great! BUT, the violence was too much; body parts in a barrel, a guy getting shot in the eyeball, dead bodies flying out of a funeral van and getting run over in the street, and an already dead bad guy getting blown to bits by a land mine. The little bit of humor couldn't save this movie due to the blood and guts.
