The only safe choice for a sub-compact. The sub-compact class is made up of cars that are around the $10k starting price. Some of the only are choices are the Kia Rio and the Hyundai Accent, both of which are garbage. For a $12k, the Echo is one good car. They can go up to 150,000 miles with no major problems, pretty damn good. Don't know why Toyota put a new face on it for 03- it looks even uglier now.
