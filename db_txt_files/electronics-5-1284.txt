this is a phenomenal piece of equipment. i researched for weeks trying to find a player that was easy to use and good for the gym. honestly, a little kid could use this, i figured it out without even opening the instruction book. it's light, and cute...the only complaint i have is that it eats batteries, so make sure to get the accessory kit with the rechargeable ones (it also has a docking station that can be hooked up to your stereo!) i couldn't have asked for more. if you're considering this product, get it. you won't be disappointed.
