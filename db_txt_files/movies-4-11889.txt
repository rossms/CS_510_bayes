saw this over the weekend---and while it's not uproariously funny-it is quite entertaining and humorous in a backstabbing vulger sort of way. it's worth watching just to see Robin Williams return somewhat to form for the edgier comedy he had been known for before fame/hollywood neutered him into perma-Patch Adams. also Edward Norton is fantastic as a low grade motivational cartoonish well....rhino who gets rooked into the center of things.
