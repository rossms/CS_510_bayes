So much fun, it is more an experience than just a place to eat. You must go in a group! There is a room devoted just to the Pope, which has pictures everywhere and a cast head on the table. There is a special kitchen table so you can eat where the food is prepared and are introduced to everyone that enters the place during the tour. The menus are on the wall, there is something gaudy and great in every spot you look. Southern Italian Food at it's best, Oh and the name means Joe's Basement.
