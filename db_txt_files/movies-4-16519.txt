i find this movie mildly enjoyable and i like watching this movie mostly cause of the banter between the main characters. but yes many of the complaints against it i'd have to agree with. they could've given the characters a lot more stuff to say and do or something, fleshed-out just about everything a little more. i think tommy lee jones did a great job considering all the problems. but clint eastwood's acting, though he is a legend, i think puts him in the same boat with costner.
