I love Haagen-Dazs ice cream. Coming out with the new Desserts Extraordinaire (Strawberry CheesCake, Blueberry CheeseCake, etc...) was a great idea. I use to eat this flavor at a franchise in one of New York's malls. They stop selling it and I prayed that one day it would be available in the supermarket. Now it is! Haagen-Dazs has the best tasted ice cream... I would not eat any other brand.
