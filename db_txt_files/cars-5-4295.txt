I'm on my 3rd Caravan, I've had a 1990, a 1999 and now a 2002 Grand Caravan and have had no problems with any of them. I've test-driven others before each purchase but keep coming back to the Caravan for price, safety and reliability. From a safety aspect the Caravan gives me more elbow room, we sit further away from the side windows and the doors feel much heavier and solid than the lighter doors on the Montana/Venture.
