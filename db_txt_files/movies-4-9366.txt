This was a pretty decent movie. Though it was very silly around the edges it still made the point that you can t judge a book by its cover (or a bimbo by her blondeness). Reese Witherspoon does an excellent job giving the audience a healthy serving of medium sized laughs and a few good zingers and all without the requisite side of cynicism. If you re in the mood for something similar to Romy and Michelle or, as Shroomwoman already pointed out - Clueless , you may want to rent Legally Blonde the next time you visit your video store.
