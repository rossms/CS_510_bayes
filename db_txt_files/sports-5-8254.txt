The only flaw that Shaq used to have was that he couldn't shoot free throws if his life depended on it. That factor has changed since he joined the Laker's roster. He( along with Kobe and Phil) is the reason why the Lakers have won 3 straight NBA titles. He will most likely go down as the greatest center of all time. He is physically nuilt for that position.
