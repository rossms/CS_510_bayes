This man impresses me more and more with each passing year. His record speaks for itself and he seems to be a genuinely nice man who has not only his own players well being in mind, but opposing players as well. Without a doubt the best college coach out there right now. This Kentucky fan gives coach Krzyzewski a strong five.
