I used to live here in SF after leaving wonderful NYC and now reside in Atlanta. SF is a great place to live and play. It is a tad expensive for some but is generally worth the price. The city is condensed and therefore sometimes crowded in peak tourist season. The scenery is gorgeous and the people are awesome. This city has great shopping and food as well as culture. I would rate SF 5 stars if it were a bit less expensive. As for the person that said you can't swing a dead cat without hitting a gay person, I suggest you stop swinging cats...especially in San Fransisco.
