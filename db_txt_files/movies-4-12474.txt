I may be prejudicial here, since I love Johnny Depp! He is so quirky and odd in this movie... ( isn't he usually though?)that makes it worth watching. It basically is the typical Willy Wonka story, but done with a few twists and lots better special effects, though I do not mean to dis the original Gene Wilder comedy in any way! It's pretty good for light fare and or family watching!
