Probably the best all around place to go to law school when you consider academics/reputation, the pleasantness of the study body, great Bay Area near SF location, and fantastic sunny weather. The other top schools all have major drawbacks such as extremely unpleasant, ultra-competative students, crappy location/campus, or too large a student body.
