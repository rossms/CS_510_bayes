Special effects are really good (except for the shark which I personally didn't appreciate much). Too slow, especially the first half hour. The storyline is very disapointing : nothing's happening on the boat between all these fishers. It could have been much more exciting (like drinking scenes, real fighting ones, tensions or friendships) as noone really knows what happened between their last transmission and the moment they disappeared. What's the real purpose of having all this characters waiting for them, while they don't express any strong feelings : very flat.
