I have only tried the anejo and reposado. Typically anejos and reposados of the same brand are similar, with the anejo generally being a bit woodsier and smoother. But these are two distinct animals here. The reposado is good, but I find it has a strong dill-like flavor that is a bit disconcerting. The anejo is one of my full-flavored favorites. When placed side-by-side to the reposado, the greenish anejo almost looks like extra-virgin olive oil. Oaky and rich, almost bourbon-like. I'd place this a close second behind my favorite anejos, herradura and Don Julio.
