Excellent and compelling look into the future of our country. Any who found Waco or the Weaver incident disturbing, who wonders why all the new gun laws haven't stopped crime, and wants to know why the 2nd Amendment to the Constitution of the United States of America is important should read this book. John Ross has included a history lesson (Yes, it is a historical fiction, with a LOT of fact) on the how the current gun laws have come into being, and why private firearms ownership is a staple to freedom.
