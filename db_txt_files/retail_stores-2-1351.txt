Usually shopping at Macy's is uneventful, but I recently experienced a disaster with an order through Macys.com. They actually let me order something that wasn't in stock, sent me an email stating that everything was great with my order, and then took over a week to let me know they couldn't find what I had ordered. As much as I shop - over the Internet and in the real world - that is simply not acceptable!
