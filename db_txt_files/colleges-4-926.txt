Ive attending CTU for about 6 mouths now and my overall experience has been fair to good. The books provided are not followed in any of the classes and even the instructors are sometime frustrated with the material that needs to be covered. However most of the instructors and professors are knowledgeable and concerned with providing and good education. Yes, the cost is high; but the convenience of online anywhere learning for me is worth it.
