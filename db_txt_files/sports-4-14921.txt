Another Cowboy who was just part of the successful whole. Probably more important to his teams success than Smith but still benefited from the great offensive line. With the loss of great linemen over time and a few concussions later he should just be thankful he had a chance to win the big game. On basic skill and ability he is better than most but not at the same level of the true greats.
