One of the most under appreciated coaches in the NFL. Excellent talent evaluation. Let Eddie George go, avoiding paying him big money and Chris Brown looks like the real deal. Took risk with McNair and the franchise is set at qb for the next decade. Always has team in contention with defensive schemes that match its talent.
