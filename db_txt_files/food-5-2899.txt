I am commenting here on one of my absolute favorite milk chocolate products in the world, and that is Russell Stover 'Mint Dream'. I am a chocolate conoisseur, having sampled some of the best chocolates the world over. That said, the 'Mint Dream' is 'to die for' if you like mint and milk chocolate. It is basically a whipped mint concoction dipped in milk chocolate and simply out of this world! I make it a habit to stop only at supermarkets or other stores that carry this product. It's that good!
