I've never really liked these snacks. They first came to my local Swedish store last year and since everyone said they were so great I decided to try them out. I was pretty dissapointed. I had expected them to be a more fun version of Cheez Doodles but they only tasted like rice-biscuits with neon orange dust on them. They stuck to my clothes and my fingers. And even 'my' cat wouldn't touch them. If he doesn't like the snacks, somethings wrong with it.
