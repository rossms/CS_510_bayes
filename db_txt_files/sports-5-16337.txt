Terrell Owens is without a doubt the number one receiver in football (and this comes from a Viking Fan)!! Randy Moss and Marvin Harrison are exceptional athletes and receivers, but they have the benefit of good offensive lines, pass catching backs, (the #1 QB in Payton Manning) and good offenses in general. T.O. played on a terrible 49ers team and still had a superstar year. He is an athletic specimen like no other. Move this guy up the list!
