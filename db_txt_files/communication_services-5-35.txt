Problem with most long distance carriers is that their industry is so competitive that their customers are often left fending for themselves, so as a consumer it pays to keep yourself as up-to-date as possible with rate changes. Nevertheless, I've found Sprint to be the best at negotiations when getting the best rates. All carriers have their problems, but Sprint has always ended up the winner in both price and customer service.
