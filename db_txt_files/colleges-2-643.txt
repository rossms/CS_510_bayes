I know it from the 80's. A den of politically correct BS. A discriminatory Affirmative Action program and a lot of professors who were very taken with themselves. My class voted Joel Friedman as the outstanding professor of that year. Personally, I thought he was one of the weakest. Not stupid or unprepared, just a poor instructor.
