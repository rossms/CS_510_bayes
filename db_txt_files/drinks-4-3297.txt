This is a fine gin for a reaonable price. It tastes good and doesn't burn that much when mixed in 7up. To spice up any activity, such as going to the movies, I will fill up a plastic container with shots of this and then dump a can of 7up in there, along with some carnberry juice. You can't even taste the alcohol, and you are messed up by the time you get to the theater (when your friend is driving).
