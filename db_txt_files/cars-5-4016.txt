Had this vehicle for 10 years and it has been the best. Body is a little thin on the sheetmetal, but the frame/drivetrain/structure is bullet-proof! I've seen 4Runner and Pathfinders fail and break where my Trooper has been. V-6 is a bit small but it will get you where you have to go, even pulling a 3500lb travel trailer and kids/dog/canoe. Dependable as everything, paid $11,790 BRAND NEW in 1991 while my friends paid almost twice that for their other SUV's. This vehicle is for some reason highly underrated... I'll never figure out why!
