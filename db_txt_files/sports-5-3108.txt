The unquestioned best player between the Honus Wagner era and the Ruth era. Even Ted Williams called him the best left handed hitter in history. His homerum totals reflect the fact that he played in the dead ball era and, he thought home runs were all show. He proved he could hit them one day in a double header after being challenged by a reporter, by hitting four in the two games. Also, still second in career hits and third in steals!
