I'm using this as my browser currently, and loving it. It's very similar in feel to using Microsoft's Internet Explorer browser, only FireFox is much less vulnerable to hackers and spyware. You'll still have to periodically re-enable IE for certain Microsoft updates, but this is certainly worth the free download.
