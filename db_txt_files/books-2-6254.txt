The title's a tad racist, Don't you think? What if this book was named Stupid Jewish Men or Stupid Black Men ? None of us, including myself, would have even bothered to pick it up! Let's admit it, The book is good, but the title is offensive. I bet if it was named Stupid Arabs or Retarded Conservatives , We would have all protested it. But since Mr. Moore is white,It seems to be okay to make fun of your own race.
