Absolute pit. . .high school with ashtrays. . .I guess there is something good and democratic about a univeristy that is affordable and anyone can go to, but it is considered an academic lightweight. Terrible parking and zero campus culture. . .although it is near downtown Cleveland (see my other rating) makes this place somewhat appealing for nightlife. At least the students aren't full of themselves.
