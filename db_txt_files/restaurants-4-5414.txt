they have good breakfasts, and the menu choices are ok, but you have to order a dinner bar to get more for the money, the prices are higher than ryans and usa steaks. The food is pretty good, but I haven't ate dinner there in a very long time, but I did have the breakfast bar the day i went to cedar point. I burned up that food quick form all the rides and stuff there. but it was good and the eggs were cold though, could at least keep them warm or keep seriving them fresh, fresh eggs are the best and anyone caould agree. oh well good overall and good price.
