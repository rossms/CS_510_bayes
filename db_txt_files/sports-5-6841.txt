Darko was a big mistake...but what if you picked mello? Would Tayshaun be as good as he is today. There is still time for Darko to grow. Everything Joe has done has been good. Signing Rip to a long term contract...getting sheed...and ultimately winning the championship. There is not a better GM in the game today. Some people said he would slide...but if the Pistons win half of their remaining games it will be another 50 win season. The Pistons don't need to win 65 games a year to be good. They have already proved that. They will win another championship.
