I do not understand why the media, the Democratic party, and most of all Gore and his supporters are not stating the obvious. Gore has won the popular vote and the state that is in controversy is unsurprisingly goverened by George W. Bush's brother. Also the fact that the ballot was very confusing, coincidence, I think not. I believe the American people are smart enough to see the truth and should demand that something be done to correct this unfortunate situation.
