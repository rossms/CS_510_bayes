An utterly breathtaking place on Earth. This natural wonder must be seen to be believed, from the majestic mountains, to the awesome geologic formations, to the amazing forests and redwoods. I recommend early Spring as a great time to visit, while the waters are flowing strong and the crowds haven't all yet converged.
