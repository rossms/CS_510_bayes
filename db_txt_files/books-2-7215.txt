The first book gets 4 stars in my book, the second was pretty boring and I couldn't make myself finish the third. The concept is very well conceived: an alien race has mysteriously sent a spacecraft into our solar system, what's it here for; are we in danger? The investigation yields more questions than answers. The second book dealt mostly with contrived political maneuvering, and the part of the third book I read seemed focused on a moral dilemma sprouting from the social ineptitude of some geniuses (although their intelligence was fairly well written).
