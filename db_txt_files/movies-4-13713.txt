They should have let the boy be a sissy stage actor. But seriously, a good but not great movie about the drama involved in being a teenager. Seize the day, go after that girl you like, pursue your unorthodox career goals, live your life - and god forbid if your parents are not supportive. It is also the story of what can happen to the adult who fights the power and sides with the kids versus the adults. Definitely worth seeing, but definitely not one of the all-time classics.
