Another astonishing breakthrough album from the labelable band TOOL. This band will never sell out. Never go soft. TOOL has created their own worl of sound and this is another masterpeice. Maynard uses his vocals more on this album than ever before which is a very nice change. TOOL is one of the most consistantly brilliant bands in music today. I look forward to the future of this truely genius group of musicians.
