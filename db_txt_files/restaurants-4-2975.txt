Well, well, well... I must say that the quality of the ice creme here is lacking compared to Baskin Robins. However, they do have a wonderful little treat to make up for the lower-quality ice creme--sorbet! I am a big fan of the lemon sorbet they sell, and the other sorbet flavors can be good too (depending on your taste preference on what flavors you prefer).
