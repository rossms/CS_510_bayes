Forget The Worm's antics and forget the hair-coloring. The fact was that he was one of the fiercest rebounders of all-time and one of the greatest defensive players ever. He couldn't hit a jumper. However, despite his lankiness, his job was the hardest. Rebounding is the hardest thing to do in the NBA. It's harder than blocking a shot and it's harder than sinking shots from half-court. He was a winner and every team he played on, they won.
