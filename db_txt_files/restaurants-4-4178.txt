Don't be hating on the SouthWestern Eggrolls just 'cause you can't make them yourself. I start with those, move on to a nice NY strip with loaded mashed taters (smashed with the skins on and smothered in cheeze and bacon bits), and finish it off with a seemingly bottomless Blue Pacific (blue curacau margurita). Apologies for my spelling, but I like the place and the food. :)
