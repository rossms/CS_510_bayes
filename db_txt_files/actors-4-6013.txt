i didn't really think much of tom cruise until i saw jerry maguire. and i was surprisingly impressed. and a little while later i caught cocktail on cinemax and liked him in that too. it's those toned down movies where he gives off this whole vibe of vulnerability and sweetness lying beneath his surface cool that help break his image of too-coolness. he's really one-of-a-kind, i feel, as he seems to pick his roles with great care. either that or his personality lends itself well to those roles of shallow guys who really wanna be good people.
