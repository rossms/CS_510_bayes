i tried a couple of their soups, and they are nothing like the commercials say. sure, they have big chunks, but if there's only 2 potato chunks in the whole can of potato soup, they better be some really big chunks! they taste ok (the ones that i've had) but are definitely not worth the price. after i ate my bowl of soup, i had to go eat a sandwich just to feel like i had eaten something.....and i don't eat that much!
