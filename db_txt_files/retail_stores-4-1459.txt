I used to work there, they were OK with me. The prices are good. Sometimes, however, they engage in shaddy end-shelf pricing practices, meaning they would put high priced items next to sale priced items making it real easy to pick up the expensive product by accident thinking you got the sale priced item. Krogers does the same thing.
