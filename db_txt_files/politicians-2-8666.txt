Wilson was an idealist at heart, but many of the problems of the 20th Century could be traced back to him. His league of nations stripped Germany of all of its pride which eventually lead to the rise of the 3rd Reich. Him remaining in office after suffering a parilizing stroke was an incredible irresponsibility, especially at such a critical time as after World War 1. Like most liberals, his efforts were unrealistic and did not come to be.
