i just love edinburgh. yes i am scottish. the architecture is wonderful. go down the royal mile and stop in some of the little stores. be there for the edinburgh festival - a fascinating and fun time to be there, especially for the parade at the end and the fireworks in front of the castle god i'm homesick
