I have always enjoyed the coffee at Starbucks, but unfortunately they charge way too much for it. It isn't that great. I would much rather go to 7-Eleven or the Dunkin' Donuts for my coffee, but occasionally I will stop in at the Starbucks for the awesome smell of coffee that invades you when you walk in.....
