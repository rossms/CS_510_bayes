Though I congratulate people who can afford to shop in this one of the most pretentious stores in the epicenter of ostentation 5th Ave- I still don't understand why someone would spend more for equal product. I purchased a suit here and was impressed with the service but no more so than I've been at other places of less value. I can do without the Saks bags I'm more about function.
