Peanut Butter Cap'n Crunch is my all time favorite cereal, always has been, alwasys will be. When we got to choose our cereal at the Grocery Store, I would always head for the orange box with the Cap'n on it. I now find myself trying to persuade my kids to throw it in the cart. It is also excellent dry, which is a key culinary feature of cereals. Pop 3 or 4 in your mouth and let the lovely peanut butter taste melt in your mouth.
