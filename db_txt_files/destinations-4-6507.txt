 A big state with a lot of different personalities. Austin is a great city. I'd like to go there again. San Antonio is also a fine city. Dallas and Houston are kind of big and spread out with their share of problems. The Deep Western part of the state is pretty interesting and enjoyable. I love the open desert land. And of course as a wrestling fan Texas is where the Von Erichs ruled. Terry Funk still lives in Amarillo and Dusty Rhodes was born in Austin. Dig it baby!
