I don't think that some people here understand Shaq, or basketball at all. I more or less agree with bruns, but not completely. Shaq is probably the most dominant player in the league today and teams honestly are forced to focus their defense around him to hold him to under 30, and still fail sometimes. Now that he is on the Heat and away from Kobe, it shows who was the most important to that franchise. Shaq = instant success.
