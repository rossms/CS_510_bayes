This airline is only getting two stars because of their safety standard, both times I flew with this airline I always felt safe. But overall, this airline is bad. Rude flight attendants, horrid food (if you get any), no entertainment, and the seats are uncomfortable. I will never fly with this airline again, even if they do have cheap tickets...no thanks.
