Great motivator, decent recruiter, and mediocre at play calling and the X's and O's of football. BUT...he has more heart and pride for this state and team than any other coach in the country. His good nature and winning attitude are enough to rate this guy as one of the best in NCAA Football today. GO HOGS !!!
