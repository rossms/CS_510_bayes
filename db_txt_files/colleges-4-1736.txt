Wake Forest is one of the little known jewels of education. The school is well funded, the student body is small but large enough for a relatively healthy social life, and the curriculum is competitive. Even with its small size, Wake Forest even manages to field competitive football teams on occasion, something that can't be said for Duke (for instance).
