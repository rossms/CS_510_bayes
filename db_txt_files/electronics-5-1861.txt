I held out on getting an XBox until recently. I hadn't played the system much at all until then. Being the PS2 fanboy that I am, I had relied on my limited experience with the system to form my opinion. Of course, I slammed it. Now that I've sat down and played Morrowind, KOTOR, Fable, etc., I can honestly say that the XBOX easily nudges out the PS2 as the better system. Lots has been said about the controller, but after using it for awhile, it's hard to go back to the PS2 controller. It feels flimsy in comparison. I feel like I cheated myself for not buying one sooner.
