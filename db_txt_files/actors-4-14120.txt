I know you guy's think she's just another bad actress with a pretty face. Well she is, sort of (minus the bad part). She is definately going to come and go like other Beverly Hills 90210 stars. Actually she already had gone. I will give her three stars for her unforgettable work in the hip teen thriller and one of my favorite teen slasher movies, Urban Legends. She gets a half a star for having the decency not to star in the unbarable flop to Urban Legend except for a cameo (the high point in the movie). She gets her last half star just for that pretty face I mentioned before.
