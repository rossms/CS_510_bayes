I actually found this movie to be quite charming. The humor was consistent and the storyline rather cute. The lead actor (forgive me, I don't know his name) was surprisingly good and one of the best attributes of the film. Elisha Cuthbert still looked as pretty as ever but this film did nothing to prove any acting talent. This movie was definitely a pleasant surprise.
