I attended a rival school of Harvard but have spent some time in good old Cambridge. . .I am fascinated by a few other reviews here. Yes, there is grade inflation at the undergraduate level. Yes, there is a level of pretentiousness. . .but I experienced more of that at the undergraduate level. Harvard graduate schools and students are pretty worthwhile- attitude or not. I think Harvard's strength is in the graduate schools, those undergrads kind of get in the way. . .
