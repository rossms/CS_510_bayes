I am on Abby Redicks basketball team. I love her whole family and JJ doesnt deserve to be hated. he isnt cocky or anything, he is just very good at basketball and his sister is DEFINATLY following in his footsteps. i dont know why people say all this crap about JJ. he isnt bad! and neither is abby- the most HILARIOUS and funnest person in the world! and i look forward to being on her team next year!
