Cal Berkeley in my opinion is a good school as far as academics and sports. I love Berkeley because I am from there and I visited the campus a couple of times when I lived out there. The people are nice and friendly. It is very open as far as variety goes, and the city is very nice. It's not too expensive to live out there either.
