Elway may not have had the best stats known to man, but he didn't have an offense built around him either. He lacked a defensive unit thoughout the nineties and still managed to make over 40 fourth quarter wins and 7 fourth quarter ties. He was consistant and led his team to 14 winning seasons in 16 years in the NFL. And what about his leadership commitment to one team. Few players can say that they played for the same team for their entire career, let alone a 16 year career. Players aren't all about stats, especially quarterbacks, they are supposed to lead the team along with making plays.
