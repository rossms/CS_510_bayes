Greatest 3rd baseman ever. . .yes, Brooks Robinson had the better glove but Schmidt wins because of his bat. 500+ Home Runs and he drove in more RBI's than anyone in the entire decade of the 1980's. Too many gold gloves to count. . .and he did this on the concrete floor of the Vet being booed by the toughest fans in America. I love the Phils, but Philadelphia should come to the realization that we never really deserved Schmidt but we got him. . .it was a privilidge to watch his entire career.
