I don't really like the beaches in the area around Crandon Park. The beach further down Key Biscayne in Cape Florida is much better. Crandon Park has kind of rocky beaches and it's usually crowded on hot weekends. It has a great view of the Miami skyline though, but for relaxing, other beaches in the area are better.
