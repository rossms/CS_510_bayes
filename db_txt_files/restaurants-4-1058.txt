when i was little just down the street was an original a&w where you pull up and they'd come out to the car and we always got those little baby root beer mugs. now that was cool. now times has changed and its been everything from a run down video store that got for selling x-rated videos which happens to be illegal in utah unless it cable version and now its a discount cigarette store. i think better off when it was a&w
