WOW! This is the one game on Playstation 2 that can compete with HALO. An interesting plot, a geomod that allows you change the environment in realtime, and a very fun multiplayer option. I've spent hours playing multiplayer with friends, it's quick paced and gives you the option of bots; something unheard of in HALO. Now the game has gone to the greatest hits status and is a GREAT buy for 20 bucks.
