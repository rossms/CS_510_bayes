I have to give Tony Dungy five stars. He is the class act of the NFL and would be an asset to any team he coached. In Tampa, he built the foundation that Jon Gruden topped off. He is still the heart and soul of the Buccaneers. Would that there would be more coaches like him, who are admirable men on and OFF the field.
