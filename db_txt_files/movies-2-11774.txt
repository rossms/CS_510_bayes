If you're expecting political commentary, you'll be disappointed; there's not much. Though the puppeteering was excellent, and the movie had its moments, Team America wasn't that great. A specialized (well, kind of) group goes around fighting terrorism around the world (and destroying national treasures while they're at it). The story circles mostly around gay jokes and a really bad love story. It's supposed to be cheesy, and it's supposed to be stupid, but even taking that into account, it just wasn't all that entertaining.
