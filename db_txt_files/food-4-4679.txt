I think of it as cheddar s softer, more conservative cousin. American is an all-purpose cheese that is creamy enough that it melts well for grilled cheese sandwiches and just mildly sharp enough to compliment a bologna sandwich (with a little mayo and hot sauce, mmmm). All in all it s okay, but too run of the mill to get very excited about.
