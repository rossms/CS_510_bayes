Great Food and Service. Pretty waitresses! Good steaks and fries! Three downsides 1. The wait to get in is sometimes too long. 2. They play country music which I hate. 3. They need to stop hiring so many college age kids to work there and start hiring more young adults my age (25-35 years of age) to work there.
