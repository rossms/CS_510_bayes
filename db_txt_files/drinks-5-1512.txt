I have to give it a 5 even though there is nothing special about it. There is nothing like a cold bud longneck when you're thirsty. You can put down a lot of them, and still feel pretty good. Also, unlike many of the tastier micro beers, Bud does not wreak havoc on my stomach the day after. Steady, consistent, and available almost anywhere, this beer is a foundation of American culture.
