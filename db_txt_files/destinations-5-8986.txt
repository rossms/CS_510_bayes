I have chewed skoal for about 8 years. I saw your product on sale and gave it a try. Not only is it MUCH cheaper then skoal but it taste better. I have changed over about a dozen of my friends. Just wanted to tell you keep making a great product at the right cost. (I pay aroun 1.75 a can to skoal 4.50)
