The movie has grown on me over time. Its true that this movie came out as Ben Stiller was putting himself in every comedy movie to come out, but Jack Black and Christopher Walken make this a good comedy. The premise is stupid, but it is entertaining if you want to laugh. Certainly not a great movie, but worth watching if it pops up on TV.
