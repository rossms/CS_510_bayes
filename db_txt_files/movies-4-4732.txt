This is a good family movie. Especially if you are a dog lover. It takes place in the 1940s during world war two. A young boy named Willie gets a dog for his birthday. the dog helps the lonely boy make friends.It has some cute scenes. It is a nice story about a boy and his dog. Frankie Muniz is fine as Willie.and the dog is cute. Not a stand out movie but good for the family.
