I am from Minnesota (thank god for the 1987, 1991 Twins. The Vikings every year do this (find a new way to lose). Losing on the final pass last year. In 1998 have the best regular season than any team in history and can't even get to the Super Bowl. I want to see a Super Bowl win for the Vikings, but the odds are better right now of finding a spaceship in my back yard.
