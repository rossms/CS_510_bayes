ok, i really didnt know how to rate this movie. see, im a cheerleader. this is the kinda movie for cheerleaders because u understand it more and know how they feel like near competition. but i would understand if alot of people that are'nt into cheerleading wouldnt like this. the only thing that makes me bad about movies like this, is how they always make the cheerleaders snobby. well yea, once in a while we'll get into our snobby preppy mood but its not like that every second. well i liked the end of the movie. they still were happy with 2nd place which made me happy :)
