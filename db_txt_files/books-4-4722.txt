I right now am about 90% through this voluminous work. I have to say that it is fairly simple to follow, but a good chunk of the novel is very dry and essentially unnecessary. It seems to be about 420 pages so far in that very few things have happened. All I can say is that there better be one hell of a climax, otherwise I will definitely be disappointed when the book ends. Dickens does a good job of symbolism through characterization with Pip, Jaggers, Wemmick, Miss Havisham, and Estella. Overall a good book now.
