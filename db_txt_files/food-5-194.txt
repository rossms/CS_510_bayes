Life is one of my all time favorite cereals. It is sweet but still contains some nutritional value. It is good as a snack, dry and it is good when it is soggy. Life is also a great mixer too. You can mix it with any cereal and it is so good. Life with Golden Grahams....so good...Not to mention Mikey. He was an icon of the 80's.
