I got the amplifier and antennae on Ebay for $100. The reception is great. I've made a few long trips since I had it hooked up and now I never have to scan to find stations. Even in the mountains with rain all the stations come in perfectly. They have alot of good music sports channels. They're comedy station could be better. It's mostly gay comedians. I have nothing against gay people, but I don't want to hear their gay jokes for half an hour. Altogether, I'd still give it a five though.
