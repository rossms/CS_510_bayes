This was my first choice college. It would have allowed me to stay close to home, and be in that ivy league click. I instead went to UR and, ended up just fine. It was a little wierd being a townie and schoolie at the same time (seeing as I am from Rochester, still lived in the dorms though lol) But according to a previous poster, I wouldn't have made it in Cornell, because I am just a big hick from Upstate New York.
