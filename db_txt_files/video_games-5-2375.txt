This game was amazing. Unlike any fighting game on the market, this four way fighter is a gem. The best part was multiplayer action and the moves were not difficult to master. In addition, this game required actual skills to become the Smash Brothers master. The sound, controls, graphics, and fun were all there, making this game a solid gold.
