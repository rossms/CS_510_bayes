The new Panini's are great, everyone in my town is rushing out to buy them. Now all of the stores in our area have none left. Everyone hopes they get them in soon. The are the best things and filling too. It's amazing how with that little tray they go on that the bread comes out crunchy....All of the flavors are excellant. I'm actually going out today to every grocery store in my area, even ones that are a little further away to try to find the infamos PANINI. And to make it even better they are only 6 WW points. Thanks Lean Cuisine. Please hurry and ship our orders!!!
