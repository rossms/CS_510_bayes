Good acting, bad politics. I saw this Baldwin blowhard on Letterman way back in the Clinton Inquisition days. He was suggesting that we get a lynch party together to go down & burn the Republican witches who were leading the Clinton witch hunt. What a hypocrite. Then there's the fact that Bush is the President and Baldwin is still paying his taxes as a US citizen. Did I mention that this guy was a hypocrite? But...I'm going to change my rating to 4-Good based soleley on, The first prize is a Cadillac, second prize is a set of steak knives, third prize is you're fired. Coffee is for closers!
