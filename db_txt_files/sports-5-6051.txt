Randy Foye had a terrific junior year for Villanova. He topped it off by exhibiting his skills in the post season where he averaged over twenty points, and finished with 28 points against the National Champion North Carolina Tarheels. Randy's ability to take his man off the dribble is second to none; more than one defender has had his ankles broken by this 6'4" dynamo. With a superlative senior season underway, and a potential Final Four on the horizon, Foye has the next level within his sights.
