The great thing about GTE's service is their reception is 100% excellent. In every area I went (including bldgs., malls, etc.) I had clear reception that never cut out. The poor thing about GTE is they don't offer the best in cell phone choices, and I had a problem with billing just a few times. Usually the service reps are good with that. I think GTE's one of the best to choose based on the reception.
