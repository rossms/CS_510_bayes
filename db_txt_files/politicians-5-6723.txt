I am a white man who opposes our upcoming racist war in Iraq, Bush's tax gift to the rich, and the erosion of our civil rights and the racial profiling of Arab-Americans. Who am I supposed to support for President? The only candidate with the courage to oppose the republicans on all of these issues is Al Sharpton. I salute him for his courage and hope he gets the nomination.
