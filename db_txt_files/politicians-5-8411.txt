He was the greatest President of the 20th century. People who didn't like him are only mad because they weren't smart enough to vote for him. Please stop looking at the small picture and look at the big picture. The Soviet Union collapsed, the wall fell, and the world is better because of it. Stop being so selfish. He didn't do this, he didn't do that. Wake up! Stop looking to others, stop blaming others. Your life is what you make of it. If it sucks, its cause you SUCK. GOD bless Ronal Reagan. God bless America!!
