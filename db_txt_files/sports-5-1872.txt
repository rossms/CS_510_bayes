God bless America. The New York Yankees, the greatest team in the world. God love 'em. The most successful team in baseball and in all American sports. I have been a fan of this team since I was 9 years old (1977). Reggie, Mickey, Whitey, Babe, Joltin' Joe, Thurman, Yogi, Jeter, Bernie, Paul O'Neill, the Iron Horse - Lou Gehrig. All those names plus their great managers like Miller Huggins, Joe McCarthy, Casey Stengel, Ralph Houk, Billy Martin, Bob Lemon, Buck Showalter and now Joe Torre say it all. The greatest team on earth. GO YANKEES!! 26 World Championships, 39 American League Pennants, 'Nuff said.
