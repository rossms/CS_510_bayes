This is clearly the time of the parable of the fig tree whereby the nation of Israel is torn between two leaders, one good fig and one bad fig. I wish to remind all who can read - to read with understanding what the lord God of Israel has planned in our immediate future, and to stay working in the field when the rest of the world whores after the spurious messiah who will arrive as nations close in around Israel. It is time beloved. Let us watch and wait patiently this decade for after the 5 months of the false one we will rejoice in song - the song of Moses and Emanuel will reign forever. Amen.
