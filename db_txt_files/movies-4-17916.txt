The Ezorcist was a pretty good movie. It wasn't scary (except for the spiderwalk thing,phew) Its definitly not a masterpiece. It has its moments that I wanted to go sleep cause most of the parts were really boring.It could have been better if they got rid of all the boring talking parts that last for like,an hour in total.First there's a creepy part in the movie,then they start talking. Its not a very smooth,fast paced movie but I recommend this movie.
