Outstanding. 5 ordinary people used their own funds to find this treasure and create their own museum. A tribute to them as much as to their find The spirit of adventure continues to exist in the USA. I recommend this to everyone. All privately done. No public or corporate money went into this. A great undertaking, an excellent story and a great museum.
