Peyton Manning is a special player. He is a born leader who has been groomed to be an NFL QB since he was a kid. He works incredibly hard, is intelligent, and big and strong. Sure, his arm strength isn't great, but neither was Joe Montana's. He can get the ball where it needs to be, whether it is to James out of the backfield, over the middle to Dilger, or deep to Harrison. And, 99% of the time, he will make the right decision. At the end of his career, after a couple of Super Bowl rings, he will be among the all-time greats.
