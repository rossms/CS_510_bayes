A very overrated team year in and year out. I'm surprised that the team hasn't played better this season. At least .500 ball. They always seem to have an effective offensive line and pretty good wideouts. As for Kerry Collins I believe he has underachieved and has been inconsistent since he has been in the Pros. I expect better numbers from him but the problem with this team stems from poor team chemistry and possibly coaching/management
