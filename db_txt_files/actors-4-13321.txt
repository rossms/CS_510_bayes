Parker Posey is beautiful in that cute 'bitch-factor' way. I like the way her face is constructed. Deep set eyes that seem to hold a disapproving squint all the time, and her lips are pursed a lot as if in question to someone's honesty. Her body is sexy in an athletic way and I think that she has cute charm like Sandra Bullock, yet different because it's Parker Posey. She reminds me of a girl named Heather I use to know, and I bet that she looks similar to a lot of people. She has that, I'm the naughty girl next door ambiance about her. I think she's sweet.
