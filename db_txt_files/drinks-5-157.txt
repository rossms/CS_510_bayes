A wonderful, crisp beer. The Belgians really now how to brew a good beer. When I drink Canadian beer now I can't help but think of that Simpsons episode where the Germans by the power plant and Homer offers to buy one of them a beer at Moe's. The German's reply Ha, ha. Thank you, no. I fear your beer takes like SVILL to me. Am I right in saying only a SVINE would drink this beer? I drank a Molson Canadian for the first time in a while not so long ago, it was sour and fizzy like soda pop. Keeps going like this we'll match the Yanks with that yellowish water they drink down there.
