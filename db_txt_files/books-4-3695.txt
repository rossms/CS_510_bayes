A true classic in every sense of the word. Themes of love, death, sex, patricide, and brotherhood run throughout the novel. I really enjoy Dostoevsky because of his use of psychology (which wasn't well developed in his time) to show how and what the behavior of the characters too. It really bums me out when Ivan feels he is to blame for his fathers death when really, it's his fathers bastard.
