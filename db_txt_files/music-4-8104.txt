This video is good because of it's originality. Most videos today all involve the same motifs. Lots of flashy cars, hot girls, and dancing. This video steered clear of those common themes and went for something different. Also I can't think of any other concepts to fit the song. The only reason some people might not appreciate it, is due to shallowness and lack of artistic appreciation.
