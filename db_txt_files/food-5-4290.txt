When I first heard of chips made from Sweet Potatoes I thought - YUCK-O! Though I have recently discovered that sweet potatoes really aren t bad baked with a touch of butter, I never liked them much with brown sugar, marshmallows, etc. But these chips are another thing entirely and nothing like the classic white potato chips either. They come in a couple of flavors but I like the ones spiced with cumin, cilantro, and cayenne pepper. Oddly, this is something that has both taste and is relatively good for you. Beats baked (white) potato chips by a mile.
