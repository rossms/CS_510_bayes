I hate this rating page, they should really separate the bourbons and whiskeys - there is a difference. This is my personal favorite of the whiskey's. The irish love their whiskey, and this is the preferred irish whiskey. A bit tastier than american whiskey's and perhaps a bit stronger in flavor. A good straight wiskey to drink.
