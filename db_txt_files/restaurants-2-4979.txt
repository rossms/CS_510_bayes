I am sorry I wanted to put one star but since Chili's is the absolute worst food I have tasted in my life other than from my grandmothers house I had to give it two stars for just plain BAD! This stuff tastes like a classier version of Chef Boyardee. Yuck. I make pasta 10 times better than this and I'm not even an italian. Pretty pathetic. Who gives a crap about their breadsticks? If I wanted to be filled up w/breadsticks I would have went to a bakery. Not even worth my time or money.
