Wow, what a call by Munson back in September. Yesterday's performance was the most impressive Giants performance since their first Super Bowl year and maybe one of their most impressive in their history. Back when Fassel made his guarentee, I thought he was losing it and that he was coaching the final five games of his Giants career. Instead, with a smothering defense and dangerous offense, he has them on their way to Tampa. Absolutely amazing.
