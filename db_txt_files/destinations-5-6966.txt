I was lucky enough to get to stay for 2 weeks while attending college. It is magical, we found this place with a view and we would sit here everynight and just look over the city. Just thinking of how it was 2000 years ago. Don't fall into the tourist traps, do your own thing and explore. Look for off the path restaurants and they are no more expensive than anything here in the USA.
