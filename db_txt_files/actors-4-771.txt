For someone who didn't start acting until 30 years into his showbiz career, Richard Farnsworth did very well for himself in his later years. Like Angel_7, I too first noticed him in the Anne of Green Gables series and thought he did a wonderful job in his role. The last thing I saw him in was The Straight Story which, as a movie, left something to be desired. But Farnsworth, as usual, did well with what he had to deal with in this way too long and plodding epic . All in all he serves as a great example of all the untapped talent out there.
