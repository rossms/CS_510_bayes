Judging from other reviews, I must have missed something the couple of times I visited Prague and walked across the Charles Bridge. It's nice, but it is really just an ordinary bridge when it's snowing and sleeting (my first visit). It's too crowded during the tourist season (second visit). The bridge itself is OK; scenery around it is nice, views are nice, but not, I think, as spectacular as others have described it. It's all in the eyes of the beholder, so maybe my eyes need to be refocused.
