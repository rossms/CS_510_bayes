OMG after reading these rating, I fianlly see the kind of people who goes and see's his movies...young girls. Re-read some of the things you girls wrote....shut up..come on girls. We are talking about his acting not about you and him getting together and who he is married too. He is a good actor for the roles he plays in, he is a goofy person in real life so that is what makes me good in the roles he choices and they are the goofy roles. He is good at that. Be nice girls
