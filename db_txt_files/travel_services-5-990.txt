I have used Two Small Men With Big Hearts 3 times in the past few years and have had an enjoyable move all three times. The office staff is informative and friendly, and the movers were a riot. I wont go as far as to say they are perfect, there were a few ups and downs, but on one move the quote they gave me was higher than the actual bill. It was nice to save money on a day that I thought was going to cost a fortune. I would definatly use them again and highly recomend them. Betty Sue Pritchard
