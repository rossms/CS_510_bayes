Great bathroom reading material! It's hard to believe that most of these things actually happened (I say most because some have, in later books, have stated that some of the stories were proven false, but nonetheless they're still entertaining). For those who don't know what this book is: It's a collection of news clips and stories of individuals who have removed themselves from the gene pool by causing their own demise through foolish actions and decisions, or at least have seriously injured themselves to earn them a runner-up status. You can find this book in the humor section of most book stores.
