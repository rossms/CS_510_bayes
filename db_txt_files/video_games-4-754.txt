Our family likes to play trivial pursuit on occasion. We have different sets to play at the same time such as family,silver screen the regular set and we use the Disney cards with Trival pursuit as well. We make up our own rules so it does not take as long {hey we are not geniuses} the questions are fun some plain old trivia and others can be educational. A fun family night game.
