This store is great! For fall 2005, they sell some of the best fitting lowrise jeans around, I tried comparable jeans in Express, Old Navy and Gap, and honestly, NY & Co had the best fitting ones out of all of them! Also, they have great work clothes. If you sing up to be on their mailing list, they send you coupons at least once a month, so it's definitely worth checking them out!
