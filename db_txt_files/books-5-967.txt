Definitely the best book in the series yet, and my current favorite. I couldn't put it down until I had read the last page. The death of my favorite character had me pulling my hair out, and my heart wrenched during the scene in Dumbledore's office at the end of the book. Augh. It was so good. I can't even describe it.
