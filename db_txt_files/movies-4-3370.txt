The movie did not live up to the hype, but it was still good. Almost all the stars received cheers when they appeared on-screen. The use of Matrix-style effects was a plus. The story could of used some work though. The martial arts was typical Jet Li, kick ass. The leading lady Aaliyah looked very good.
