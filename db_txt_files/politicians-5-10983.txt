whatever happened to politicians who had minds of their own. Oh, you mean like John Kerry who flip-flopped on every issue? Or do you mean Daschle who was manipulated by his party? Democrats are losers because they don't have minds of their own. LOL! Thune is great. It is nice to see someone with morals in DC.
