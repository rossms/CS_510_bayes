I admit it, this movie was creepy. Sure the hype was annoying, but this movie was original and creative, not to mention profitable. In a time when horror movies seem to feel the urge to show every last gut coming from a stomach wound, it was refreshing to see a movie that relied on the anticipation of horror to scare the audience.
