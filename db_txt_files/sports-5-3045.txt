Injuries more than booze cut down his career. He wrecked his knee when he caught his spikes in the chickenwire outfield fence in Cleveland and after that could barely hobble about with a terrible limp. Until then, he was about as good as they come, right up there with Mays, a great hitter, blazingly fast base runner, and above average fielder. I think he had more raw talent than any player I have ever seen.
