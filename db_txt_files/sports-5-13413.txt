Is the epitome of one who has learned from earlier miscues in Cleveland. It took a lot of balls in '01 to go with some kid named Brady over the established franchise guy when Bledsoe was ready to go. Going with his gut rather than the guy making all the money established him as a guy who is interested more in winning and chemistry than paychecks and who makes what.
