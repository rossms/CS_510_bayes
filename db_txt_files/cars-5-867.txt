Unstabe, meaning not for whimps! In 96 the xp was the most powerful machine out there! Still outdoes many newer other makes. I loved my xp and would seriously consider purchasing another! I found it rather easy to work on, fix and was all around loads of fun! Warning sticker on machine reads something like this Warning: this watercraft will exceed the preformance of any other watercraft you may have used, use extreem caution!
