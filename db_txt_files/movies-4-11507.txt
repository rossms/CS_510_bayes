Far superior to its predacessor, American Pie 2 really was an enjoyable movie that had me laughing my tail off from start to finish. I think that this film did better at developing the characters than the first one did. We began to understand Jim's (Jason Biggs) struggles and problems, which made for great comedy. A very good movie. What was that??? ... I just shoved a trumpet in your a$$ .
