The only thing I can say about Nassau is the beautiful ocean around it. But otherwise it is a dump, there is nothing to see here but a bunch of shops selling cheap garbage to cruise passengers and tourists. If you go to the Bahamas, go to one of the Out Islands like Eluthra, don't even bother with Nassau.
