I have to agree with every single person who has rated GC. They are not the best band in the world by far, but they still are good. People however should not like GC just because they think a memebr is cute. And as far as them being punk in some ways they are and in some they aren't. For instance being punk means you don't care what other people think and GC doesn't care about what other people think. However they are not punk because they are such a sell out. If you go into a hot topic store it is over run by GC merchandise. There are even lunch boxes! Well peace out''
