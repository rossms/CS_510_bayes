Man, I've been addicted to these things recently. I normally don't eat a lot of cookies, but for whatever reason I've been downing Vienna Fingers morning, noon, and night. You know you're in trouble when you're following your morning cereal with two cookies. They're sweet without being over the top, and I can't seem to get enough of them.
