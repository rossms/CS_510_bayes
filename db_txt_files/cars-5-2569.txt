The Mclaren F1 is the best production car ever made. You people cannot step to that. I noticed two morons that rated this car a 1... to them... you obviously know nothing about cars. Especially the 2nd comment, the Mclaren was not made for 1/4 mile races idiot. Ever seen Le Mans racing? I cannot believe the stupidity of people like you in the world.
