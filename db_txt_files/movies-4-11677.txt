While I'm not a big fan of either Ben Stiller or Drew Barrymore, I did enjoy this film quite a bit. Playing a young couple manipulated and driven insane by their tenant, Stiller and Barrymore work off each other quite well, creating many hilarious moments. Eileen Essel who plays the old lady who causes all the trouble just shines. A surprisingly good movie.
