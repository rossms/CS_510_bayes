A great place to visit, if you are a Maryland native or a tourist. Always clean, informative guides and so many interesting things to check out. The entire Aquarium is so soothing to me. It is always a hit with kids too. Not too expensive for admission..a must see if you are strolling around the Inner Harbor for the day.
