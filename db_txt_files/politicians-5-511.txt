I love that so many people can make so many baseless attacks on an international hero. It's amazing that people equate leftism with terrorism, especially since Al-Qaeda is incredibly right-wing just for a different religion. This man ended apparteid in South Africa, anyone who disagrees that that was a good thing is a cold-blooded rascist. I respect him EVEN MORE for going against Bush and his idiotic attempt to divert attention from his failing domestic policies. Just so people know this is what a rational reasoned opinion looks like.
