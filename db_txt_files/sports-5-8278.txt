An absolutely unstoppable force. This year, he has been the most complete player in the game and should win the MVP. Some folks say that all he does his jam, but why not take the highest percentage shot if it is always available. The only knock on him is his FT shooting and it may cost the Lakers down the stretch, but that doesn't diminish his incredible ability.
