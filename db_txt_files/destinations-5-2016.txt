Country with excellent people who PEACFULLY protect their rights under the rain and snow. AND they will win!!! Still, Ukraine it is not only corruption and revolution. It is very beautiful country where you can find everything: sea and sub-tropical climate in Crimea; hiking, rafting or skiing in Carpathian mountains; wonderful architecture and culture in cities like Kyiv, Lviv or Kamianets-Podilskyy
