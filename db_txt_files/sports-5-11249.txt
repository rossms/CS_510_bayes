This guy has amazing energy and gets his players to follow, Kansas City sucked and had an offense first system. Texas on the other hand had good football players and Greg taught them how to play. Texas went from top 60 total defense to top 15 in one year. and how many super bowl defenses did he have in Denver. Doesn't D win superbowls?
