it was fun and nice to find this refreshing drink in a place i was taken to. my wife always needs to visit taco bell when we visit the States. for me it was a nice meeting with a new flavour of mountain dew. a dew fan already, this made it extra acceptable to join my wife on her drive threw experiences at this restaurant. a shame that it is not sold outside of this place. (or is it?...)
