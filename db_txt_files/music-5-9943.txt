I love On the 6 by Jennifer Lopez. The fact that she has a mix of all diffent types of music in one CD is really awesome, because it has a little bit of hip-hop, salsa, romantic and latin house/pop which is off the hook. I have already bought two more because my other ones started skipping from playing them too much!
