Thank god for cable! This movie always seems to be on during those rainy weekends. I've watched it a hundred times and will likely keep going. Tom Cruise is handsome as ever in this movie. The story is sweet and I dare say has enough guy stuff in it to make it more than a chick flick. The soundtrack is so perfect, every time I hear one of the songs I can picture exactly what went on in the movie when it played. I agree -- it sure was sad when Goose died.
