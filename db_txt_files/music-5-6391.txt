The surprise album of the year. I know Alice Cooper is a rock legend and all, but I didn't realize how much juice the guy has left. This album is flat out incredible and he sounds great on the album, with excellent scary thought provoking lyrics. This is a very good stocking stuffer for any rock fan. I can't get over how good it is.
