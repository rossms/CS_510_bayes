Standing for Intelligent Television, the Intellivision game platform was introduced in 1979 by Mattel Electronics to compete with the Atari 2600. The platform retailed for around $300 and featured a 16 bit chip and better graphics than the Atari system. The problem I had with the Intellivision was that the controls were too cumbersome and complex with their spinning disk design. They just were not very ergonomic, and the game selection was lower than with the Atari.
