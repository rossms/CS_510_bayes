Cheesecake Factory Cheesecakes lack a creaminess and a flavor I desire. They serve far too much whipped cream with the slices, and the slices are relatively small for the price. I was however, impressed with the knowledgeable and hard-working staff. The Entrees were fantastic!! I have special dietary needs, and they were most eager to meet my needs. Also, they are one of the few places that serve Illy coffee and espresso, which is, in my opinion, some of the best coffee available. Definately deserves a 30% tip in my opinion.
