Golden Corral is most definately one of my favorite restraunts. I used to go there at least twice a week when I lived in Kentucky (I miss doing that now). For a low price, there is a huge selection of various foods. Their fried chicken is excellent, as are their all-you-can-eat steak and shrimp deals. I very much enjoy their Macaroni and Cheese for some reason. This place is awesome, espescially the newer, larger restraunts.
