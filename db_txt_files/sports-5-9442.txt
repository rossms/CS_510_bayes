look. all i have to say, is SPEEDY IS DA MAN. He is awsome. The only reason he isnt starting is because of his injuries. but i believe that he has way more potential that tony parker. tony didnt even play in the fourth quarter of game six. hahaha. tony blows, speedy rox. o, and by the way carson, you are going to owe me ten bucks. hahaha
