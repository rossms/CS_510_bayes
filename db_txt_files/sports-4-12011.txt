Tennessee was very good under Manning. As an individual player he is great but his overall impact on his team and their seasons negates 1 star. He played well in some big games but more often he was a major factor in the big losses. All criticism of his inability to win the big game is deserved. The Heisman vote certainly appears to have been more anti-Manning than pro defensive player as some contend.
