He's not a great actor, however he is an endearing and charmimg one. Its really interesting to watch his progress over the ten seasons of Friends. He started off very unsure and a little awkward, but as the show went on, he became comfortable and really in tune with the comedy. Even though his off-television efforts have been dismal, he'll always have a place in the TV hall of fame for Joey.
