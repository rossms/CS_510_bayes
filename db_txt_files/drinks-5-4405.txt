This is my new favourite scotch and the one that made me a convert to malt whisky. For those curious about single-malts, start with either Glenlivet or Glenfiddich. Drink it neat or with a little ice, but this one's not for mixing. Glenlivet is smoother than Glenfiddich but has a tad less character. I look forward to trying other single-malts.
