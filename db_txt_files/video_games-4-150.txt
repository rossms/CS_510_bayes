Doom II came out nearly two years after the original classic, closely followed by a whole host of FPS games using the Doom engine (Heretic, Rise of the Triads, Hexen) - naturally we expected that same WOW factor when we first sat in front of Doom. It was more of the same thing but beleive me, this wasn't a let down - on the contrary, we wanted more of the same thing but as a bonus we got better graphics, bigger guns, scarier enemys and larger levels. I gave Doom II a 4 because though it gave us what we thought we wanted, what we really needed was Quake and that was soon to follow.
