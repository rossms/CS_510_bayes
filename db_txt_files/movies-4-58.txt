For sheer spirit-lifting entertainment, you can't do better than this film, by director Steven Spielberg and writer-producer George Lucas. Harrison Ford stars as Indiana Jones, the roughest, toughest, and most unpredictable hero to grace the silver screen, who risks life and limb against a set of the nastiest villains you've ever seen. It's all to save the world - what else? Rated PG for violence and gore. 1981; 115 min. -V.M.G., Mick Martin Marsha Porter
