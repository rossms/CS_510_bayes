I could probably save a few dollars a month by researching price plans and tracking my usage, but the time it would take isn't worth the money I'd save. AT T does the job, and the 7 cents all the time rate is cheap enough for me. Plus, since long distance is becoming increasingly commoditized, it shouldn't be long before prices approach 0 cents and we don't have to see all those stupid commercials any more.
