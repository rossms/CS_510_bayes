Funnier than I expected. The characters were likeable, if a little bit too stereotypical (the smart guy, the partier, the nice guy, the nerd), and the plot was surprisingly clever. My only complaint was that Tom Green didn't show up enough in the movie - in fact he doesn't even go on the road trip. The snake feeding scenes were hysterical.
