Let's face it... I'm from the East Bay, and going to a UC (maybe Cal) I'm a little partial to the Golden Bears. Their defense and special teams lost a good player in Delthia O'Neal, but they have a stellar defense led by Andre Wadsworth. All they need is a little more offense and they will be a force to be reckoned with in the PAC-10.
