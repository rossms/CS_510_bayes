I'll give him a two because he has done some good things in his community and he has not deterred from his beliefs, no matter how dumb they are. This man pays too much attention to race and is a false prophet as someone else said- he simply wants to emulate Martin Luther King, Jr., which I'm sorry to say, nobody can do. This guy has a severe addiction to cameras and microphones.
