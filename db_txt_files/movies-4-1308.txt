Part 2 is good. It's classic QT But too much of a let down after the hyper kinectic/non stop action of Part 1.The climactic showdown between The Bride & Bill was over before it could even begin.After dispatching Her previous targets with lengthy,stylized almost ballet like movements I expected a SHOWDOWN.My God they didn't even get out of their chairs!!!!
