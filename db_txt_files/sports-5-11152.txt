Don't judge this man until you know him. I do, he's wonderful. You know, I thought I hated Rick Neuhiesel, but when I met--even though I was wearing Duck gear, he was very nice to me and I made a friend out of an enemy!!!! Try meeting this man, and he will be quite an inspiration to you, and you'll want to be a good person like him!
