My favorite team - a group of really tough guys with a lot of heart. They don't always look the best doing it, but they usually find a way to win; as far as entertainment value goes they are high because they usually play close games. The heart of the team is now Steve McNair who is along with Brett Favre the toughest quarterback I have ever seen.
