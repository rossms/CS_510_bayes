I grew up in Ann Arbor...But I go to State..why? well number of reasons because of location on my part but also because the college town is really designed for a college and nothing more..Ann Arbor has the university in the middle of a fairly large city..And I was around UM students all the time..not exactly the type of atmosphere you want to have while going to college..
