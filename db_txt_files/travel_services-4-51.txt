I agree that Continental has improved a lot over the years. Especially compared to Northwest which is what I usually take. Northwest has gotten really stingy with their food, which is why I was surprised that Continental kept giving us plenty of food. It wasn't half bad, either, as far as airline food goes. And my trip went pretty smoothly.
