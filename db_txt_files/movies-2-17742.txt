You know, it's just not that good. My father built up Halloween so much during my life, that I expected it to be good. In reality, it's just a low budget horror flick. I was completely disappointed with Jamie Lee Curtis, and she was the only actor in the movie. Extremely formulaic bad predictable horror.
