I enjoyed reading this book. Lots of brain teasers when it comes to codes used throughout the book. For sheer entertainment, it was more than worth the time it took to read it. The book is controversial because it assails a lot of traditional Catholic beliefs (what the book at the outset claims to be facts are claptrap, fiction, and fantasy). Unfortunately, a lot of people have bought into the veracity of the book, and have taken it to be gospel, so to speak, rather than the fiction it is.
