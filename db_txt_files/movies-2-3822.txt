i was unimpressed by the fight scenes-- they were all too unrealistic, but that seems to be what's hot right now. the plot was pretty lame. the acting was decent, but not great. i would not recommend it to anyone-- the only reason i didn't leave the theatre feeling like i had wasted my money was because i was being treated to dinner and a movie. but then again, i think i knew from the previews what to expect. save your time-- the previews show all the good parts, and in much less time!!!
