I have had my 1988 Toyota Camry for nearly 7 years. It has over 210K miles and has been absolutely flawless mechanically. It provides good gas mileage due to being a 4-cylinder. My only repairs are regular maintenance (tires, brakes and such...). I will continue to purchase Toyota products in the future. Sure, they are more expensive than their competitors, but you get what you pay for.
