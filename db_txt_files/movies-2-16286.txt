I had huge expectations when I rented that movie. But what did I see? There was nothing but blood in the movie. It was so brutal, there was no way I was able to finish watching it. That was a disturbing movie and I don't want to see it again. I understand they wanted to go into a different direction, but that was way too much for me.
