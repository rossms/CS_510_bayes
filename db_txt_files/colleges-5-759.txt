I have had nothing but a wonderful experience with Capella University. I am currently working toward my mastes in Human Services and have had mostly wonderful instructors. I will admit that if you are not a self motivated learner then perhaps an online institution is not for you. However, I would think that someone motivated enough to go for their masters degree would have to be self motivated. As an employer I think hiring someone so self motivated would be a bonus. Overall, I would have to question anyone who has given Capella a negative score.
