Souljacker's cool. It's one of those albums where just about every track follows a theme - the theme in this case is the disillusioned, angst ridden, going on on postal, kid. I think Buss Stop Boxer is the stand out track "... I don't miss where I come from, but each night I dream about being back home.... then I wake up in the morning, too tired of being alone... so I get up and go downtown... and pick me out a little piece of ground... where i can prove something to the world....don't look at me... (i'm the bus stop boxer)"
