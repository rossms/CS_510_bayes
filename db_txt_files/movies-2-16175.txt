Bad movie for one reason: you can't cast a feminine male as a lead. Leo DiCrappio fails in this role as he's failed in every other male role with the minor exception of Gilbert Grape, which fit his mental capacity very well. DiCaprio is a pansy-boy who can't act to save his life and certainly doesn't belong in a Scorcese film. If there was such a thing as stock in directors, Scorcese just dropped 100 points.
