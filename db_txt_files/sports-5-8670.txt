Alright, listen up!! Chris Webber is one of the best players in the NBA for a few reasons. No one mentions that he was the NBA rebounding king a few years ago. In his last healthy season, he was the most dominating player in the NBA averaging 27+ ppg, over 11 rebs per game. His strength is only rivaled by Shaquille Malone and Ben Wallace. Everyone knows he's one of the best passers in the league, not just for a big man. He once put the ball around the back of a defender then threw an assist! He WILL be All-NBA this season barring an injury.
