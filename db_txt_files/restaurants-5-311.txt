Burger perfection. In-N-Out Burger absolutely has THE best fast food burgers in the country. They never freeze their meat, so freshness is guaranteed. The lettuce is taken right off the head of lettuce just before making the burger, the tomatoes are always juicy and ripe, and the special sauce is outstanding. Put all of that on a lightly toasted bun, and you have the best fast food burger there is. In-N-Out is so good -- and people love it so much -- that it has developed a cult-like following, and several web sites exist just to talk about their burgers and the ingredients.
