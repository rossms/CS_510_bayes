This album brought the voice of Protest against the government and the status quo to mainstream music, and it did this with a power and fury that grabbed the attention of the press, politicians, and young people everywhere. This lyrically intelligent album features a powerful rhythm section, a brilliant guitarist (Tom Morello) and the powerful, angry, insisting voice of Zach Delarocha. Their sound is amazing, their message compelling.
