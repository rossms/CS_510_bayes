I was really confused by this movie. i couldn't tell if it was meant to be an obnoxious children's flick and just the dumbest comedy I've ever had the inopportunity of watching. There was zero amount of plot and entertainment value. A cast of hasbeens and a computer-animated kangaroo...it left me scratching my head because who would honestly make such idiocy knowingly?
