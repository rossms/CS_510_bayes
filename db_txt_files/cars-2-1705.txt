6 recalls so far. This is a piece of very poorly engineering by Ford of North America. They should work on quality control! This car is fantastic in Europe with very feel quality issues. Until Ford of North America can deal with it's obvious quality issues (lack of any quality) all of us should avoid buying this car. Resale value will be terrible. It's a shame, the car rides and handles very well. The ZTEC (can we say Honda) motors are very fun to drive, stay away from the gutless base engine.
