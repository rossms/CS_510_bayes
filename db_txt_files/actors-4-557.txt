I'm a big fan of character actors and I consider Lon Chaney to be the first. Watching silent films I think is an acquired taste. To be able to act with just your face and your body takes incredible talent and Chaney was a master at it. He also understood the camera. The original Phantom of the Opera is still the best. Other films include Laugh Clown Laugh, The Unknown, London After Midnight, The Road to Mandalay, The Unholy Three, and The Hunchback of Notre Dame.
