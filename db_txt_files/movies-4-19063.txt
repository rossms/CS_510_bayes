Not to long ago my friends and i cheated death but not in the same hollywoodized way as depicted in Final Destination where the victom actually witnesses their demize. But still i thought back to this movie and i was glad that it was... just a movie. I loved the first one and i loved it's sequal. These are awsome movies to watch but a certain croud of people most likely would not enjoy the final destinaton series.
