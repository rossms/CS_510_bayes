I think I just like the whole idea of amusement parks since I have not come across one that I really did not like as of yet. Had another fraternity formal in college at Williamsburg , VA and went to Busch Gardens the following day. Now the nice thing about this place is that they have a huge Beer Garden (being owned by Anheuiser Busch) and that was kind of a fun thing ot do the day after a big formal party. After the beer garden , we went to the park and went on all of the rides and it was a really fun time. I would say that this park was not as nice as the Busch Gardens in Tampa, FL, but not by much.
