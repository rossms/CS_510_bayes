Definately the best in the series so far. It really gets to your emotions - the death, Umbridge and Dumbledore at different times all pulled my heartstrings (for good or bad). Great new characters are introduced. My only complaint is that there seems to be a lack of plot. It could be retitled 'Harry's fifth yr of high school where suddenly all that raging teenage angst kicks in and he gets angry at everyone'. I was expecting a huge war between Dunbledore co. and Voldemort. Instead there was hardly any mentioning of 'war' until the very end. Hopefully the sixth book won't be such an anti-climax.
