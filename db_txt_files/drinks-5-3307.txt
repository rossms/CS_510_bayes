Brit girl in the States looking for a decent cider to cool me on hot summer days, and sorry but the American stuff just doesn't cut the mustard. Tried Hornsby's but it tastes like apple juice, way too sweet. Thankfully I found some K, which I've never even seen in England before, and it's perfect. Not too sweet, not too dry, just a nice smooth taste in an attractive bottle. Must find some when back in England!
