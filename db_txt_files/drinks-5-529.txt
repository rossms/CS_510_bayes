A original and unique west coast style developed by this brewery - great and unique taste. This beer uses a lager yeast at the higher ale temperatures during fermentation - creating a unique ale/lager hybrid. Superb for that occasional special treat, strong flavor but exceptionally smooth. Also they have by far the best tour of any brewery I've been - mainly because you get to taste all of there great brews - and they are all exceptional.
