Just an absolutely terrible film from top to bottom. Pacino's acting salvages a bit, but come on. No name production, corny music, predictable outcomes. All the 'gangsters' applaud it as the story of a guy coming from nothing and rising to the top, but watch Rocky if that's what you're after. It's really an annoying movie.
