With their recent rebranding of their other department store brands, I guess we're all going to be shopping at Macy's now - the Starbucks of department stores. Is this a good thing? For the most part, I think so...there's a good mix of merchandise and some good values. Some departments can be a real mess, though. The freestanding stores (especially the west coast flagship in SF) are in better shape than some of the mall locations, which are barely a step up from Target.
