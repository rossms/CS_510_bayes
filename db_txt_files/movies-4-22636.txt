I went in there not expecting much - how can real life compare to the fantastical world of comics. The movie was nice for an introduction to the world of xmen but I thought they could have had a worse villian than Magneto - like Apocolypse. Also Rogue is my fav character because of all her attitude, unfortunately in the movie she is just a little girl
