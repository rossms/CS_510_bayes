When James Jeffords of Vermont switched his party affiliation from Republican to Independent the Democrats heaped praises on him calling him among other things Courageous. Yet when Zell Miller, who remains a Democrat, questions the decline of values from within his party (and by doing so is informing them why they have been losing elections) those same Democrats call him a traitor. So let me make sure that I understand this: When a Republican changes his party he is courageous. When a Democrat questions the decline of values within his own party then he is a traitor. Okay, I got it now.
