The latest Sony Discman lines are very excellent. They feature a very cool, silver design. The bass is very excellent, and exceeds the bass output of any portable CD player that I've used. Also, using the Sony rechargeable battery allows the battery to be recharged while in the CD player, which is very conenient.
