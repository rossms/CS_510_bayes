The inside the complex, Tower of London, is really interesting and historic. One gets to see the Crown Jewels, and that is a great spectacle in itself. However, Tower of London is far away from other attractions in London. The cost to get into the Tower is astronomical, that is why I gave it a good, not a great rating.
