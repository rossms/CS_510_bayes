Good: 1. Chocolate tour-At the end of the tour, they give you free chocolate bars. 2. Hershey 3D-They had a vibrating chair, snowflakes, and bubbles. It was a fun show. 3. Teen Tails-A musical about a teenage werewolf. 4. Their unique Ferris wheel. 5. You can feed ducks or rent a paddleboat Bad: The Parrotville band-This band was so boring that everyone tried to leave early. I could not keep my eyes open.
