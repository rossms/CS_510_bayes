Duke was awful before Coach K got there. He built one of the greatest dynasties the game has ever seen from scratch. He has an impeccable eye for talent, and makes his players want to play basketball. Watching Duke games, you get the feeling that his players have the same respect for him as he does for them. Always gracious in victory and defeat. One of the greatest coaches of our generation in any sport.
