No one and I mean no one, could move like Barry. He had the heart of a Lion. He played 10 years for a sub-par team and only had a few injuries and hardly ever missed a game. He was worth the price of admission alone. Barry was truly electrifying. The only regret I have(other than him not winning a Super Bowl) is that my oldest son didn't get the chance to see him play.
