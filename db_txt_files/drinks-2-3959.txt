milky and horrid tasting junk that tries to come across as healthy, hip, and a good addition to athletic behavior. you always see kids in the Sunny Delight commericals carrying bikes and downing this stuff like it's liquid energy. also what's w/the Hip name, Sunny D. that's dumb. at least KFC had a reason to change their name.
