A great centre that still have much to prove. For a guy who's 76, he has great spin moves and passing ability. I just cant believe that he's already at top level at such a young age. He just need to increase his upperbody strength and be more aggressive down low. He will be a monster in the league within a few years, second to none compared to Shaq as his experience goes and as he learns how to fully use his body.
