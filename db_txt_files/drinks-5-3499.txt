I think a Margarita is a versatile drink. It can be very elegant and a great accompaniment to a delicious Mexican meal or it can be as informal as punch with friends watching a football game with chips and dip. I don t see Margaritas as a fruity drink on the contrary it s bitter (which is what I love about it) with that wonderful line of salt surrounding the glass. Margaritas are feminine enough for women to enjoy them without being self-conscious about drinking tequila and masculine enough for men to enjoy because it s a pretty straightforward drink. I prefer mine on the rocks.
