Honeycomb is my favorite cereal of all time. It is simple, has a great honey toasted taste, and has no artificial junk in it. It isn't a heavy cereal with tons of ingredients in it, so if you aren't too hungry in the morning but feel like eating anyways to start your day off right, Honeycomb is perfect. It is a good snack too.
