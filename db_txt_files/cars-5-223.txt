I recently purchased my Rincon because I wanted a quad that could handle any terrain, but looked sporty enough in a crowd, without looking dull and old like some of the utility bikes on the market. This ATV is a great crossover bike that will play like a sport quad, but will go where all others only dream of. The power is more than you will ever need, so hold on tight because it will pull your arm sockets out!
