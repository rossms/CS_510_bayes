I've been to this place only once or twice in my life, but found it distasteful each time. Maybe my experience was adversely colored by my childhood memories of Palisades Park, but it seemed I spent 80% of my time waiting on line in the hot sun. I don't remember the rides I did go on as anything spectacular, and everything was way, WAY overpriced. I don't know how the passage of time has affected things, but I can't imagine its gotten any better. Also, I despise the TV commercial with that repellent old man.
