My new car was rear ended by a women who had Progressive Insurance. Progressive accepted their client is at fault and convinced me that they will take care of the damage. I agreed to them based on their promise to use original factory parts. Instead they replaced the damaged one with after market bumper and a lousy paint job by their approved body shop. The bumper does not match with company bumper and it did not even fit properly. Progressive compromised with passenger safety. Beware of their concierge service. They are to save each and every penny. They promise good and deliver worst...
