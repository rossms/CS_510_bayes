Best economy, took care of the poor not the rich, kept us out of war, everyone if they were honest would say that he was better off when President Clinton was in office than when President Reagan and President Bush were in office.

THERE HAS TO BE SOMETHING FOR EVERYONE NOT JUST THE RICH. THE FUTURE OF THIS COUNTRY DEPENDS ON THE WORKING CLASS. WHEN WILL THE REPUBLICIANS LEARN THAT
