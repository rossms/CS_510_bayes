I'm actually in the process of researching for a new car now and appreciate Burned in AZ's comment. For a number of reasons I'll probably buy a hybrid, but would advise Burned in the future to avoid buying Satan's car from now on. I looked at the Sienna and it seemed overpriced . . . until I read Burned's comment. Suddenly, there's not enough money in the world for me to buy that car.
