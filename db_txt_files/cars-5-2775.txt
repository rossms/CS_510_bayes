The Toyota Celica is one of the best cars on the road certainly one of the longest lasting. I am proud to say that at over 80,000 miles this car has been trouble-free with only scheduled maintance required my Celica is running as strong as ever. As far as performance: the car handles curves like it on rails, the powerful accelerations is enough to give you a bit of an adrenaline rush which will surely put a smile on your face. These are beautiful cars from the inside out.
