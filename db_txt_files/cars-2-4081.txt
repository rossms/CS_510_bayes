What's the point of the new Olds Bravada anyways? It makes no sense. Oldsmobile is on its deathbed and I'm sure there aren't many people out there wanting to buy a vehicle from a dying brand. GM should have rebadged the Bravada and sold it as a Buick. Anyways, it was a valiant effort to keep Olds afloat by repositioning it as an import alternative. Too bad it didn't work out.
