OK, I've got a soft spot for US Air. They were the only airline to offer a real discount when my mother was dying and we had to make an unplanned rush across country. Still, they have good planes and legroom (at least on their cross country Airbus) and decent service. Just remember to bring your own food unless you like enforced dieting.
