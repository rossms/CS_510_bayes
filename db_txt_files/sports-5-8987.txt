A steal and future all-star. Wonders of wonders, I love Tayshaun! The Pistons should sign this guy forever, and to as much money as possible! His enthusiasm, range, defensive abilities (block on Reggie the other night) and speed make him a monster. He is the perfect basketball player, in my mind. Five stars.
