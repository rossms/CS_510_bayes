Gap jeans are the only ones I wear, because they fit me well. They have enough styles that if one doesn't work for you, it seems unlikely that another won't. I think it's great that they've started expanding to include bright colors and fun prints in their lines. If you want basic and boring, go to J.C. Penny. And yeah, it's cookie cutter- how many things do you own that are actually one of a kind? If you need clothes to make you stand out, I'm sorry.
