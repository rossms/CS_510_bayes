I took my parents to Ruth's Chris in Orlando for their 55th wedding anniversary. I could not have made a better choice. My experience was outstanding, as was the food and service. The steaks were superb as was everything else that was ordered. Even the coffee seemed to be a several cuts above the average blend. When they heard that it was my parents anniversary, without asking for any verification, they gave them dessert on the house. They were treated like royalty. It was worth every penny.
