All of yous out there, i'll keep this short because i'm about to go pick up my 95'Toyota Supra from the body kit man because i just modded it up and looks better than any car on the market today. Stuff all of you that think against the Supra. As a matter of fact if you cut my skin open, guess what would come out? TOYOTA SUPRA!!!!
