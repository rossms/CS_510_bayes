Picked her as a future muffin during her FLIPPER days, and that uncanny call will be further justified after SIN CITY comes out. Will the Oscar elude her? Perhaps. But in the meantime, she'll keep popping up in better rolls that'll either lead somewhere, or make the powers-that-be keep scratching their balding heads as to what to do with her. Almost painfully sexy, which'll probably hold her back. Might break away Jen Connelly-style, but'll take a wicked-smart agent to pull it off.
