previously a great actor, but let's look at his recent films: the horror flick, the disney pirate ship flick, finding neverland(which is pure sap), a remake of willie wonka, and then a sequel to the disney pirate flick. Johnny, whatever happened to flicks like Donnie Brasco, Blow, Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas, Ed Wood?
