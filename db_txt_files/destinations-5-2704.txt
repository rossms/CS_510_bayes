Chicago is one of the best cities to live in, as planners have done a great job of preserving the waterfront and building parks. My one complaint with the city is the amount of segregation: the yuppie ex-frat suburbanites and the wannabe alterna nose-ring-wearing spoiled brats live on the north side, the minorities and working class live on the south and west sides. (Chicago's motto should be: Neglecting the South Side for 100 years).
