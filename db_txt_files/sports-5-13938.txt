barry sanders is the greatest running back of all time and if he didnt retire he would have shattered that rushing record now held by emmit smith. Ill never forget it the whirlwind move the spin the complete stopping on a dime and reversing direction the man was completely unbelievable and i love him to death although mainly in his career i was a little boy there will never be another running back like BARRY JAMES SANDERS
