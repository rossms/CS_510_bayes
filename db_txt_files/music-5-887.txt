I love the c.d.When I first saw the video and heard the song Sourgirl, I just knew I had to buy the c.d.I know the guys of STP have been here for just about forever.But where I live it's like STP free zone.I first heard Sourgirl and I knew this band rocks!When I bought No.4 it was such a new fresh delicious sound to my ears.If your looking for something different and music that rocks it has to be STP and their album No.4.To me Sourgirl was a song from Mars but an exlennt one.{Sorry about the spelling}
