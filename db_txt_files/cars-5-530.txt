I have owned a total of 37 motorcycles over the past 24 years (Japanese,British and German), I liked most and hated a couple. I have owned my 93 FXR Convertible for 6 years. It is absolutely the best bike I have ever owned it handles well and doesn't feel like a huge bike. It can be ready to tour in 5 minutes by attaching the windshield and bags.I really liked my BMW's(R90S,R100GS,R80RT,R69)but believe it or not the FXR is more comfortable after getting rid of the Buckhorn bars for shorter flatter Sportster bars. Many bikes have come and gone but the FXR is a keeper.
