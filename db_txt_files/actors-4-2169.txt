Robin Williams is definitely a dynamic actor. He always took on funny roles until his recent ones in Insomnia and One Hour Photo . He is a good comedian (I love his Live On Broadway appearance) but sometimes he can be so vulgar that it isn't funny anymore. If he didn't cuss so much onstage, it wouldn't be so distracting and would lend a lot more to his crazy attitude and hilarious impressions.
