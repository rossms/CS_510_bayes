Overall, a pleasant experience. They seem to have 98% of what I need and the stores are light and airy. The staff is knowledgeable, helpful, and friendly. There's always a "good morning!" as you walk by. Had a very bad experience with a special order. The manufacturer's fault, not Lowes. But they worked hard and kept at it until I was 100% satisfied.
