I was a critic when Reid was named the Eagles head coach. I wondered why the Eagles management chose a coach from the exact same system that Ray Rhodes had come from after he had failed to get the job done. But in the space of two years Coach Reid took a team without a running back, with perhaps the league's worst wide receivers, and with a young unproven quarterback and led them to an 11-5 season and within one game of the NFC championships. His accomplishments thus far are nothing short of remarkable.
