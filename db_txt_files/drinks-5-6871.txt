Very, very smooth taste to it with no need for salt or lemon to help it go down. Like drinking water, but you must be careful because it has different effects than water since it produces spinning rooms. Very strong and girls would like it 'cause it tastes a lot better than cheaper tequilas. The price is a little steep sometimes.
