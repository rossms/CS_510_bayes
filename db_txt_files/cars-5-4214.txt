The 2000 MPV is smaller than most minivans, but it has accommodated every situation we've thrown at it beautifully. The handling and power are ample to tackle mountain roads, and the ride is very smooth. My favorite things are its unique features: Rear seat that folds flat to the floor, side-by-slide captain's chair, and middle row windows that roll down. 7 months and counting...I am still impressed with this vehicle.
