Kilmer, a great actor who has submitted some awe inspiring performances including my favorite -- Doc Holliday in Tombstone. The only way he could be improved would be to take some lessons from Tom Hanks and/or Kevin Spacey in script selection. Kilmer has had only a few projects in his career that have taken full advantage of his enormous talent artistry.
