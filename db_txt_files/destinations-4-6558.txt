The fact that that stupid redneck Dumbya came out of Wayest Tayex-uhs as he says it, has lowered my opinion of Texas a little, but I musn't judge it by it's people. Most Texans are very nice, and it is a pretty state. Four stars is what it deserves, 'cause it's not quite as good as my home (Georgia).
