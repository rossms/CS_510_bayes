Kobe Bryant is good, but he belongs in the NOBA, the National One-on-one Basketball Association. He likes to pretend that nobody else on his team can shoot. I wouldn't mind being on his team, if I were a monkey and couldn't put the ball above my head, but knowing all human beings, they'd like their share of the limelight also. There's no question that he can play, he just needs to snap out of his coma and realize that there are other people on his team.
