Quite possibly the best football coach of all time. No coach gets more out of less. Makes average ballplayers play at all pro levels. Knows how to handle superstars egos. Manages them better than anyone. See: LT, Keyshawn...etc. Makes players, coaches and fans believe. Oh, and he wins where-ever he goes (3 superbowl trips, two victories). Teams almost never out-coached or out-prepared. Drawbacks include leaving franchises on a whim and gestapo like restrictions on coaches when it comes to the media, but there isn't one downtrodden franchise that wouldn't welcome him with open arms.
