At his best, in Junior Bonner The Wild Bunch and Straw Dogs he is superb. Unfortunately he seemed to have difficulty with studio executives and much of his work suffered from mediocre to awful pre-release editing. He was more than capable of turning out pieces of dreck on his own however, so I can't go more than 4 stars now matter how much I like him.
