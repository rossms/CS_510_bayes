Surge is a hit with me and my friends. We can knock back a six pack in no time flat. It reminds me of Mountain Dew with its taste and color, but it's different. The taste is smooth and sweet, and is easy to swallow when you're really thirsty. The great thing about Surge is it's an alternative to citrus like sodas and it's sweet and smooth.
