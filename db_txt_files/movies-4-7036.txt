I got a big kick out of Ferris Bueller's Day Off. Since I'm the goody-two-shoes type who gets into trouble for just thinking about straying from the straight and narrow, it was great fun to watch Ferris pull off playing hooky for a day. His interactions with adults were hilarious, especially the situations with his parents and the idiotic Dean Rooney (who's on a mission to expose Ferris' shenanigans). If you're feeling nostalgic and are in the mood for a light comedy, this movie is a good choice.
