Disneyland, the original Disneyland, is more than a theme park -- it's a return for childhood for those of us who grew up watching Walt Disney on Sunday nights. I've been to Disneyland once, as an adult, and when I walked through the main gate and looked up Main Street and the castle, it was like returning to an old familiar place, visited many times with Walt Disney.
