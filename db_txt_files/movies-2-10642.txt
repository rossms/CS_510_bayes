I,like many others, were very intrigued and excited to see this film. But, were disappointed. I actually grew to dislike the 2 main girl characters in the movie. They were rude and unappreciative of anything. And not in a funny cynical sarcastic way, which I guess we were supposed to think that's what it was. Steve Buscemi was the highlight though, as usual.
