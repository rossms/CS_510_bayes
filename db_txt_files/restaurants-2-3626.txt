Place opened in my city a couple years ago, and we went the first week. They got our order wrong, but so what, it was ok. We didn't complain. Then we got a letter in the mail that said there were so many mistakes the first couple weeks they wanted to offer their customers a free pizza. So we ordered again...wrong again (this time they were out of one of the toppings, which they let me know when I showed up to pick it up). So we're not going back. Food is ok, lots of crust options to choose from, but nothing special.
