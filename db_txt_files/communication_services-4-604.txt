Despite other people saying they have big problems, METRO PCS has been great for me. It works as well as ATT in the SF Bay Area, has a pretty good free calling area 831, 916, 707 etc, and best of all, no outrageous monthly bill if you talk too much. They also have GREAT rates on domestic LD (5 cents a min and less) and foreign calls.I can call Europe cheaper on Metro than any other service I can find. DON'T buy the Kyocera phones, get the Nokia models. Kyocera (2 tries) was terrible, wouldnt charge while talking.
