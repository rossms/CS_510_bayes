I have visited almost all of the Presidential Libraries around the country, and I have found that Jimmah Carter's presidency is presented the best in his presidential library. The historical information is well presented and history comes alive when you come here (even though the Carter presidency did not accomplish much besides the Israeli-Egyptian peace accords-which is presented amply in the museum). Try to walk around the surrounding gardens, they're nice.
