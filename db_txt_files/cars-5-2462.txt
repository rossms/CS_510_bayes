after working on the MKIII and MKIV's for several years, i believe that these cars are the all mighty god of Import cars. ive worked on several Nissan TT's also. but the only car that stands a chance against the supra is the Skyline in ability to reach 1200HP. Yeah, you can go out and spend $300,000 on a Lamborghini but for half the price you can get a sweet looking supra and have the 1200HP that you desire. just my .02 cents..
