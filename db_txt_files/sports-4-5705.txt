A very good college player. He made the difference in the tournament and easily was the tournament mvp. However, Felton will be a much better pro then May. May is a little on the slow side and his height has been listed anywhere from 6'7 to 6'9. This won't cut it in the nba playing power forward. A late first round selection at best and I really don't see him as more than a role player in the nba.
