I definitely have something to say about the mustang's. First of all because I own one, and I am not a hick as some people suggest. Second, my pearl mustang it s an old car that runs so good, I can't complaint. Although, I feel that the mustang it s a little too big, it has a great engine and runs smoothly. My family and I have put good mileage on the car and we never had to take to the mechanic for something serious, only small checks. I rate this car as a reliable car, great for the city or for a long trip.
