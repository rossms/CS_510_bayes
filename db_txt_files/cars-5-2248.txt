I've had my z32 300zx since December of 1999, and there's not a day that goes by where I am not thankful for the car I own. The car is 11 years old, and turns head's more than anything short of a viper. It has timeless goood looks, with an unbelievably comfortable, luxurious interior. The car is reliable, treat it right, and it will be problem free. Be warned, don't let the mod bug hit you, or you'll soon be spending all your $$ on upgrades and body enhancements.
