I have lived here (Grand Haven) my entire life (34 years). There are MUCH better places to live. People like the lake in the summer, but it brings cold, clouds, and gloom. There aren't many days to enjoy it. The winter is ever-lasting, with lake effect snow fall. The women are huge, and the people are not friendly. I travel all over the United States, and realize that Michigan is one of the worst states to live. My wife and I are moving to TN soon.
