I remember this book from a college English class, and the thing we discussed that impressed me the most was the way the author(s) intentionally blurred the lines between the hero Beowulf and the monster Grendel. Sometimes, as you're reading about their fight, you don't know who is who... It pushes you to think about the nature of the relationship between the two, since, without Grendel, there would be no opportunity for Beowulf to become a hero. Kind of hits that Can there be good without evil? question.
