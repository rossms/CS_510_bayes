When I first saw this film,I thought it was great,however on second viewing,not so great.Too long by 20 minutes at least. Excellent beginning,but director Zemeckis then goes overboard.The destruction of the first transporter was a waste of screen time and bogged the film down.I kept thinking get on with it already ...The love interest was an obvious tack on.Jodie Foster was sensational, and was not even nominated for an Oscar.Go figure!.Overall still a good film,that could have been something special.
