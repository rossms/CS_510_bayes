I recently bought one of these phones through ebay for my go phone and i think it has a good speakerfone, a good reliable reception, a nice package. However, the one i bought has a bad batery life and some of the prepackaged ringtones are kinda terrible. My battery life is kinda bad probably because i bought it on ebay but it's just miner.
