Its pretty, but there are so many other places that match it in the natural beauty department and beat it in climate(New Zeland, Chile.. to name a few). The people are okay but dissplaced in attitude like most western states. Oh and BTW, the earthquakes are much much worse than California... just ask anyone living in Anchorage. Its big, underpopulated and exactly as should be educationally expected. Its natural greatness is nothing more than a nod to its remoteness.
