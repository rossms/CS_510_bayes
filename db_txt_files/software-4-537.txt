I'm using Word Perfect Office Suite 2000 - standard edition. I was pleasantly surprised to find that my old inexpensive OEM version was able to be installed on a new Windows XP machine. I though I was going to have spend some big bucks on a newer version. I mostly use the word processing portion of the suite (WordPerfect 9) and like it as much as MS Word 2000 and 2002.
