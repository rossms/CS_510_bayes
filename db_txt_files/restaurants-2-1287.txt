Roast beef , is that what they call it at Arby's? I thought it was lunch meat flavored roast beef. I have had real roast beef before and I have had Arby's why don't they taste the same to me? I guess Arby's is the real thing and the Roast beef I had at the 4 star restaurant was fake. Bottom line Arby's is crap and it isn't good roast beef, I agree it is better than a burger, but is it better than a good restaurant burger? or just a crappy mcdonalds burger that is the question.
