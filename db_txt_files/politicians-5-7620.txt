It is little known that Lincoln, when he came into office, had NO intention of freeing the slaves. He in fact, DIDN'T do that. Take a look at what the Emancipation Proclomation actually is. However, he took a great leap toward achieving that goal, so I must applaud his Abolitionist (whether it was intentionally or not) effort.
