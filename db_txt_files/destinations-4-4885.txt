I spent three days while on a trip down to the Amazon Basin. For some reason the town has caught my fancy. There were many others who stopped overnight but the thought of a nearby volcanic mountai sent the quickly on their way. One of the most pleasant things I saw was a father and his daughter giving their pet goose a soap bath in the outdoor city laundry. Friendly people, lots of foreign visitors, but nevertheless a memborable city that I would enjoy returning to.
