A good movie. It takes place in 1962 and centers around mostly teenagers. Two ready to go off to college the next day.A lot of new stars launched their careers in this movie. i am surprised it was under the drama section. it is really more of a comedy.It is hard to believe this movie was made 30 years ago. there are some funny scenes in American Graffiti.and if you like music from the 50s and early 60s there are some good songs.it is fun to watch just to see Harrison Ford, Richard Dreyfuss, and other actors in the earlier years of their careers.
