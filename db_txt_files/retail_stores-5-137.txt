I love Amazon.com! They were my positive introduction to online shopping. My experience with them has been one of consistently great prices and quick, reliable service. For instance, I sometimes go to technology workshops where you usually get a list of new reference books. I was tempted to buy several from the list once following one of these workshops but suddenly had the bright idea to cross reference the price and availability on Amazon.com. In each case the book was at least 10 to 15% less than it was on my list. The list went in the trash and I went to Amazon.com.
