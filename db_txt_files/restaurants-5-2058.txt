I was a non-Mexican Fast Food person until I visited with my daughter on a college info night in Richardson, TX. I reluctantly had one and then another and a third before I left.The kids were going back for more, too. That was in 1989. Since then, I have been addicted to Taco Bueno. Most of the locations were some other fast food company's leftovers. That was a bummer. Now, they are taking on a fresh look even in the old stores. I used to stay connected hoping they would open one in Henderson, Texas. I wish it would happen soon.
