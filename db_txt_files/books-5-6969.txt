My only complaint with this series is that I read everything he'd written at the time...and then he quit writing them. I enjoyed every book in the series, and many of them are laugh out loud funny, and they just kept getting funnier. Every time I go into a bookstore, I look him up, just in case he's written another one. A great series for young adults, or adults with a well-developed sense of humor. Read one, you'll like it!
