Searching for his potential but will be remembered as a legend one day in the NBA . . . reminds me lots of that other unknown low draft choice out of the University of Pittsburgh--the one that showed sparks of brillance in his sport but never got credit for having the right stuff till the end of his career--Pittsburgh's own Dan Marino. Carl Krauser will do the steel city proud 20 years from now as well.
