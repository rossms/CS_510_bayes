Was put in a tough spot following 9/11, and ultimately decided to join the world in combatting terrorism. There have been several "close call" assassination attempts on him as a result, but his anti-terror stance has not wavered. I think his importance can be measured adequately by the ripple effect that his death or removal from power would have on the War on Terrorism, as a radical regime would likely take hold in his place. With that, we would lose a key ally in a part of the world where they are desperately needed. Highly important and effective given the circumstances.
