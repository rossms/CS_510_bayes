Still good after all these years. Although many of us miss the classic old location on McCullough, the traditional-style Italian dishes have stood the test of time (definitely not nouveau!) I still salivate just thinking about Shrimp Paesano. The only unfortunate thing is the new proximity to golf-clubbing carrying, SUV driving, consuming Republicans nearby at the Quarry. The Riverwalk location is a slightly better choice.
