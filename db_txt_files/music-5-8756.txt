Gorgeous video for a gorgeous song. The video shows clips of the movie Pearl Harbor for which the song is the theme. Some of the clips aren't in the movie, making the video more eye-catching. The style of Faith Hill's hair is beautiful and fits in perfectly with the 1940's-style video. I've only seen this video twice, so I hope that the music stations play it more often. I'm sure people would love it if they got to see it.
