Johnson has shown his magnificent talent on the field time and time again. He has unthinkable speed and agility for a linebacker as well as the uncanny ability to make plays. He already played in Greg Robinson's pro-style defense at Texas, which ought to make the transition to NFL linebacker all that much easier. He is also an outstanding character off of the field. Most of his detractors mention his difficulty taking on blocks (when the blockers can get to him). This is a minor problem that can be coached a solution. Any time you hear a detractor say he's too fast, you know they're reaching.
