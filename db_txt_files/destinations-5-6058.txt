Anyone who has something bad to say about a state is kind of retarded. Everyone has different likes and dislikes about a geographical location. Some of you like the heat and cacti, the other half doesn't . What else is there to Arizona ? Tons, like the best entertainment, sports, clubs, the countries best restaurants... the list goes on. And if you're as fortunate as me, you live in North Scottsdale. Yup, Snotsdale to some, but there is something magical about $30-million homes for sale a mile north of my house.
