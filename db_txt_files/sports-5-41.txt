I firmly believe that A-Rod will break all the batting record in 10 years. And in 15, Albert will break his records. He is an unbelievably patient hitter who will swing at any good pitch and hit it solid. He is even becoming a gold-glove caliber fielder. If he doesn't get injured, he WILL be the best.
