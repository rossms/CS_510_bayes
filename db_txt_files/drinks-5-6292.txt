I love Diet Rite Cola because it is sweetened with Splenda. However, I never find it on sale and frankly I can't always afford it at it's regular price. Therefore I end up buying a regular sweetened cola drink because it is on sale. I prefer the taste of Diet Rite Cola, but as I am on a fixed income, I have to do the best I can with what I have. Thanks for listening.
