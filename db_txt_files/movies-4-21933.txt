I had not yet seen Terminator when this came out, but that wasn't a problem at all. This was vintage Arnold. The action and special effects were first rate and the acting wasn't all that bad. Robert Patrick who played Arnold's nemesis was particularly good. His face remained emotionless as he morphed into people and things. Linda Hamilton got pretty buffed up for the role and she was also quite good. I definitely recommend it.
