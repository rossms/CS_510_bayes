I'm addicted to this game. Just like squirrelmaster69. I even take this game to the washroom with me. It's not my game though. It is my sisters. I am getting one of my own this week thank goodness. Otherwise I would have to take my sisters game and I don't think she would appreciate that much especially since she just got it.
