John Lennon was no Communist. Did he ever do or give a penny to the needy? No. Paul is the charitable one. Lennon and Yoko were fakes and everything they did was for the camera. Imagine no possessions - and this from a couple of millionaires. Communists? You are joking of course! If he had been a genuine caring person I could have had some respect for him, but for all his sermonising, and for all that he may once have been a decent bloke, he had become a humourless, dour phony in his later, Yoko years. Poor sad sap. He could have been so much more.
