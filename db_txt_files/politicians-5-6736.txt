Al Sharpton is the new spokesman against police brutality and has started to pick up where Jesse Jackson left off with Rainbow Push and brings some much needed reforming and progressive spirit to our nation. He should probably become president to improve the welfare state and affirmitive action in our nation. It's amazing to see so many racists that hate Sharpton because he challenges the establishment. I am a Caucasian and I agree with his views.
