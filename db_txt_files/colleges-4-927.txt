I have been a student at CTU for over a year now. I have had a good experience with the school overall, but it does have a few drawbacks. The main drawback is the price. They will bleed your financial aid money completely dry. But for the added convienience of being able to complete school in 15 months and to do so from my own home makes it worthwile to me. Traveling up to the local campus to take classes for four years just really was not going to work out for me! CTU has been a great alternative.
