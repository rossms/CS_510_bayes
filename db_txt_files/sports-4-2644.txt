He's an incredibly intelligent manager, but he loses a star for poor playoff performances('88- losing to a much weaker Dodgers team/'90 Reds WS loss/'96?- up 3-1 on Braves and lost). His ego(pitching to Bonds in key regular season situations) gets him into trouble at times. I couldn't decide between 3 or 4 stars, but his activism for animals made me give him the benefit of the doubt.
