What a joy it was to see them win against the Yanks in the '01 World Series. It tickled me to death to see the Press lose that one...they were all pulling for New York. Besides stopping the Yankees, I also like them because Curt Shilling used to pitch for my favorite team, the Phillies, and never got a World Series ring. I'm glad he has one now.
