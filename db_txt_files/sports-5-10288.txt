Laughed out loud when I saw "Big Red" fan say Frentz sucks. Huskers would kill for Hawkeye's success over past four years, but at least they got some help from officals against Michigan. Sorry Husker, but the real football has moved east on I80 to Iowa City. Winning the Big 12 North?????? Kinda like being valedvictorian of your summer school class-- eh???
