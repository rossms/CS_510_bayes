This is a tough one to rate. I gave it a five for the falls itself but the rest of Niagara really isn't that great. It's kind of like going to Mt. Rushmore, you gotta see it and it's fantastic for it's sheer magnitude and awe but then your left with nothing else to do. At least at Niagara you can hit the bars I guess.
