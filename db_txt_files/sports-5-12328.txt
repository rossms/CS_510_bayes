Ohio State football maintains one of the greatest traditions in sports. The rivaly with Michigan is unsurpassed. OSU fields one of the top teams in the nation every year even though the media has a tendancy to hate the Buckeyes. What was up with the broadcaster at the Michigan game wearing maize and blue??? Anyways, everyone not in Ohio, not just Columbus, lives and breathes OSU football. The Buckeyes are the best!
