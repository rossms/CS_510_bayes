As far as fast food goes, Burger King is one of the best (next to Wendy's). The burgers actually taste like beef, the lettuce, tomatoes and onion are actually fresh and I have always gotten hot food. They also have the best chicken sandwiches and chicken tenders (appears to be actual pieces of chicken unlike Mickey D's McNuggets which are the spam of the chicken world). Cheap, hot, tasty fast food.
