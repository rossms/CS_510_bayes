Overrated, not even the best pitcher in his day. Never really had a standout season except for his strikeouts. Sometimes he would rather strike a lot of batters out than worry about winning the game, and that made him rely on his curveball to much. Randy Johnson is a better strikout pitcher, and his record (324-292) is crap.
