Impressive the last 4 years. Not as intimidating as Oklahoma fans want people to believe. When not facing top programs they dominate. Against the programs that can recruit and have similar talent they are often outplayed or outcoached. Not the great team some believe and only one national championship since Stoops arrived proves that. The loss last year to LSU also hurt Oklahoma pride since it exposed the fact they are not the only team in college football that understands great defense.
