I think she's a very good and brave actress. A rare commodity. There aren't too many actresses willing to play undignified parts, but she is one. And Titanic is an especially good movie, because not only does it have great special effects, it has good acting too. Thanks, Kate. But she does seem to zone out for a second or two sometimes.
