Western Colorado is spectacular - there may be no prettier town than Ouray, deep in the mountains, and Colorado has one of the nicest large cities in the country - Denver. My only concern about Colorado is that the front range - the area from Ft. Collins to Denver to Colorado Springs - is developing a lot of sprawl. I don't want to see this city area become another Los Angeles. The eastern part of the state is also very flat and uninspiring - people tend to forget about that part of Colorado. But for pure scenery and gorgeous setting in two-thirds of the state, Colorado is hard to beat.
