Great school, hard core education, but this university tries to act like a private university as of late. If you want to go to a school where you'll get luxury and hot chicks, DON'T COME HERE. If you want to prepare yourself for grad school however, this will get you in line for it. If you want to go to a university that William and Mary aspires to model after, just go 50 miles west to the University of Richmond, which is essentially a W&M with money.
