You haven't seen redwoods until you go to the Redwood National Park. The trees are hugmonous. It is a damp forest with tons of redwoods, ferns, soft trails to hike on. There is so much to do. The weather is perfect in the summer time. It is hot in the day, cool in the night. Camping, hiking, and bike riding. Just a great place to go. The drive is nice too.
