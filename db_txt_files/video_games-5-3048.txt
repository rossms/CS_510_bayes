I cannot believe some of you arer calling it bad. Hironobu Sakaguchi's masterpiece shold be, and is, admired by all gaming companies as they aspire to achieve this. The characters are very well varied and the system is great. Superb graphics and an absolutely great score. I love Final Fantasy, and can't wait for the next.
