This novel disappoints me. I've liked the writings of Sinclair Lewis since I was in high school (even if he did have a negative outlook on just about everything). I've read Elmer Gantry, Main Street, and Arrowsmith, all of them more than once. But whenever I try to read Babbitt, I have to give up before I'm half done. The plot just never seems to go anywhere.
