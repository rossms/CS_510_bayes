This was a great film when it came out (or at least that is what's said) and it still is. It's so surrealistic and lighthearted, like all Beatles movies. However, it actually has a plot unlike Magical Mystery Tour. Plus the style of the cartooning is so psydelic. Not to mention it has some of my favorite Beatles songs.
