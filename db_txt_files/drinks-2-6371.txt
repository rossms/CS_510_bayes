I like the regular Vanilla Coke, all because it tastes just like the Vanilla drink by Jones, and it's cheaper then buying it too. BUT diet vanilla coke, I won't even drink it. Coke is something I drink once in a blue moon and really, if people think that diet anything is going to help, your wrong. Personally, I don't like the new Diet Vanilla coke, there is a different taste to it.
