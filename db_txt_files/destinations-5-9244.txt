When I first saw Banff, I remember thinking that it was so gorgeous that it couldn't be real. Everything about the place reminded me of images on a postcard. The mountains, the trees, Lake Louise... I have done a lot of traveling around North America, and I can safely say that Banff was the most scenic place I have ever seen. By far.
