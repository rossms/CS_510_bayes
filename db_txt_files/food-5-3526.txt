Samoas are my favorite Girl Scout cookies. I always have to buy more than one box and then I eat them too fast, and have to wait a whole 'nother year before I can buy more! But I guess that's what makes them a special treat. The combination of chocolate, coconut, and caramel is just right. My mouth is watering just thinking about them!
