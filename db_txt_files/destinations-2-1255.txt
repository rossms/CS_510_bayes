Mexico is more bad than it is good. They have no clue how to control the border(actually we dont really know if they care or not, they really dont care if illegal Mexicans cross the borders). They said that they are our friends and support the war on terrorism- I havent seen them done anything to help us in the war. If they said that the dont support the war is one thing, and I would respect it, but if you say you support the war and will help us then I would expect you to live up to your words. Fox(Mexican President) is a good President for Mexico but he hasent lived up to his words.
