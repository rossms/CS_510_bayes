Maine is certainly one of the best states in the union. I loved it so much I moved here! Think Seattle 25 years ago before they were overrun with people. Portland retains it's old port beauty with it's turn of the century brick buildings and cobble stone streets. Living in Portland affords you all the ammenities of city living with the ocean and mountains all around and Boston is only 1 1/2 hours away. A great place to raise a family!
