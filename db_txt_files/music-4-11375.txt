I love this CD because Westlife have a unique sound. When I first heard 'Swear it again' (their first single) I thought it was great, but I thought they sounded like Boyzone. However, in this album they prove that they are unique. Shane, expecially, has an amazing voice. The sentimnet behind the songs are pure and sweet, if not a little repetitive. I love romantic songs, but they could include another theme to optimise the range of songs. The best songs were 'Flying without wings' 'Moments' 'More than words' and 'I miss you' (which has an Irish sound to it!) Overall, a great CD!
