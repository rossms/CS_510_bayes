This is good pasta sauce, the tomato basil is very tastey, and so is the Alfredo sauce they make. I am not sure about the other flavors, they have several flavors which is nice. Can be a bit pricey, but does go on sale, so if you stock up, you have plenty of stuff to serve over quick cooked pasta when there is nothing else in the house to eat, and you will feel like you are dining at a fancy restaurant!
