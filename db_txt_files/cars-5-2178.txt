z doesn't have as much potential as supra.. no way.. but still i've seen 700wheel hp z's pull of 9's very very fast cars.. any 6 cylinder and i6; z, supra, skyline i would take no doubt.. oh yea skyline might be faster in 1/4 mile but top end it has absolutely no no chance.. rwd=less hploss=more top end
