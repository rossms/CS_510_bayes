They don't call it the "happiest place in the world" for nothing! Sure there are alot of problems, but the essence of the pueblo is good. One of our best artists described the island to me as "we may be small on the outside, yet we are grand in the inside". Let's all of us that love Puerto Rico do whatever we can to resolve the bad parts, and polish the good. Maybe the next generation will get an even better deal!
