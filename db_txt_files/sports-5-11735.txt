Anyone not giving Sanders a 5 didn't watch NCAA football in 1988. Weak schedule ? OU, Nebraska, Colorado... yeah right! No Marcus Allen, you're right! Allen's line 2467 yd, 5.6 avg, 23 TDs: Sanders' 2628 yd, 7.6 yd avg, 39 TDs AGAINST teams that played defense, NOT the PAC-10. His retirement left MUCH to be desired, but when one has accomplished all he had, playing for a bunch of losers, in front of a bunch of losers gets, old. If only today's athletes had half as much class.
