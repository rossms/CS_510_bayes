I test drove a few of the other mini-utes, but the Escape had the most interior room, best handling, and best options for the price. Plus, no spare tire hanging off the back that greatly reduces repair costs if some guy runs into the back of you. I love the V6, 3500lb towing, leather, 6 disk CD changer, and moon roof. Yes, it had a rough start with bugs but the recent ones are not exhibiting any of those earlier problems. This is the perfect suv for someone not wanting a large Explorer or a tinny RAV. Great gas milage too (4x4 XLT 20-24mpg).
