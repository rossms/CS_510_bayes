We had to rent the version Badder Santa because the video store did not have any Bad Santas on dVD.I regret it. The BAdder Santa was very vulgar. Now I do not mind swear words but when it is MF every other word amongst others that are pretty bad, it gets old and tiresome. Most of the characters were not very likable.some were downright mean. The one thing i did like was the boy who hung around Santa was so lonely and neglected, at the end he got to have someone who was there for him and cared for him. Otherwise this was a bad movie.
