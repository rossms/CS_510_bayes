He'll be 40 in October, and he's still the most dominating pitcher in baseball; he'll throw that wicked slider right at you, that high-90's four-seamer, he'll even change speeds on you with a low-90's two-seam fastball that he'll cut in on righties, a decent slurve, and a splitter. He's so unpredictable, it's scary. He'll bust you with a fastball inside to keep you honest, and then freeze you with that filthy slider. He'll throw that slider now on any count; that's his out pitch. It's almost unfair; he's not slowing down with age, he's improving.
