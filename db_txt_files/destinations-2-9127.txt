As the other comment noted, Kyoto is a must see city in Japan. It was not bombed by the Allies during World War II so much of the original structures from that period and before are preserved. Nevertheless, the Imperial Palace (again as noted in the other comment) is a disappointment. Frankly, I cannot remember anything about it.
