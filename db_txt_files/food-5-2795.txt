I can't see or taste the difference vs. normal Reese's Peanut Butter Cups. Upon visual inspection, these don't seem to have significantly more chocolate than I'm used to. The taste of the chocolate might be a bit more creamy, but that's about it. On the ingredients, the only difference seems to be that the positions of milk fat & lactose has been swapped (they're contiguous, so that doesn't necessarily constitute a big change). Still, they're certainly no worse than a normal Reese's. So, a 5 it is.
