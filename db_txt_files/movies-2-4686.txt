I have a family member who is infatuated with all Disney animated features, so I see them all. This was not one of Disney's best. It's a silly story about a creature (Stitch) that is created by a mad scientist. The creature comes to Earth and is taken in as apet by young Hawaiian girl (Lilo) and her sister. (Credits to Disney for making a featured girl who looks like a regular person) It's the story of people from some other planet trying to get Stitch back and the problems that Stitch causes to Lilo's sister. STUPID!
