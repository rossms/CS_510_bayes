An interesting book that seemed to drag on a little too long. His Manning character with his high tech mansion in Seattle was very unoriginal, and looked like he just copied an article written about Bill Gates' house. That made his writing seem uncreative. Although the story was good, and pertinent to privacy and security issues going on today.
