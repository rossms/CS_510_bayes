My mouth waters just thinking about the food here! A fellow model, who is originally from Sweden, and I went here...we got the best service one could expect! Inga had the Carpaccio Tenderloin, while I had the Ahi Tuna. we both loved our appetizers. I went for the veal chops...gosh, the milk-fed veal is tender as advertised. Inga loved her filet. We actually shared our entrees...it was just soooo good. The last time I had tried the fresh lobster (you pick one from the tank!) All their food is good...it is a great dining experience!!
