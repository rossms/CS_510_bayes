O.K. So, I hear a LOT of people say that they would vote for Nader, but they dont want bush in the house. I feel that if each of you actually voted Nader, rather than sell yourself short and vote the lesser of 2 evils, that Nader would actually win! Sure its a close 'race', but thats what elections are about. We need to figure out, for ourselves, who we think is best and vote for them. Dont let your vote go to waste on a person you dont feel full passion for! VOTE YOUR CONSCIOUS!!! DONT BE BOUGHT!!! ITS YOUR COUNTRY TOO!!!
