they say when you reach the pearly gates, your worthiness is not measured by the thickness of your wallet. I also tend to believe that coaches will not be measured just by their won/lose ratio but more attention paid to class and character and Stan Heath is A+ in those fields plus his deep concern and attention to his players not only for their improvement in their sport skills but more so their education and life in general.One very nice hard working man that will undoubtedly get a higher calling sooner rather than later.
