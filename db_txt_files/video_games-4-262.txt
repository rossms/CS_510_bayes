This series or installment in the Mortal Kombat series is good. Mortal Kombat 4 so far is the best one in the series. I like how the graphics look in this game. The game play is not hard if you are familiar with the other Mortal Kombat games. But the best thing about this game is the fatalities. That's the reason why people play the game. To see the fatalities.
