i think this was the best of the star trek movies. perhaps it helped that the cast had aged a bit, making them a little more believable. i think perhaps that's also why the plot was written the way it was - with less action and a better story. a good old conspiracy with subtle lessons about racism n stuff. i thought it was very well written.
