JJ Redick is a great player. He is a 6'4 shooting guard that is constantly being guarded by the countrys best athletes that are all 6'6 or better and he still averages 15 points per game in the ACC. It doesnt get any better than that. He is also a deadly weapon from the outside, and if Duke has the lead going into the final minute you better start the bus because he will not miss from the free throw line.
