 Night of the Living Dead remains my favourite movie of the Dead trilogy directed by George A. Romero which also includes Dawn of the Dead and Day of the Dead . As the movie was shot on a shoe string budget, special effects are lacking and the few that are present remain laughable and unconvincing. But that's what NOLD is all about -creepy, cheesy fun. Also, the conclusion of the film is not the happy ending that some would expect. Anyhow, its fun to watch this movie at night or during a thunderstorm and I would definitely recommend it to any fan of scary movies out there.
