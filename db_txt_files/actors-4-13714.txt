She is obviously a very beautiful young woman. I saw her in American Beauty and she did very well with veteran actor and actress Kevin Spacey and Annette Bening. Even though she took her cloths off in this movie and maybe in other movies too, I would advise her not too go any further. She will lose a lot of respect from her fans. She may get more money, but it wouldn't be worth it. I hope the best for her.
