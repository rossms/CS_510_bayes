I love the Western half of Colorado. Great four wheeling in the Rockies. Stopping in the old mining towns. I never miss a chance to head up the Creste Butte. I of my favorite trails up in Colorado is the Imogine Trail, from Telluride to Ouray. Beautiful view, check out the old mines. Just be sure your 4x4's engine is ready for the high alttitudes(14,000 ft+).
