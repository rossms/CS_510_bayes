Unfortunately he was not allowed to fulfill his potential, but he cetainly was the most inspiring President we have ever had. He was able to motivate young people into public service and he was the only president to make me proud to be an American! He started the ball rolling with civil rights, unfortunately his life was cut way too short. Only those of us who were around to see him in action know what is really like to be inspired by a president.That kind of leadership is sadly absent in politics, today!
