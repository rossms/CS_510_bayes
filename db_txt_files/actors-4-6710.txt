I became an instant fan of Carnivale. I saw Nick and tried to place him, then was told he was the boy in Man Without a Face. He was wonderful in that role. Recently he played John Connor in Terminator 3. It was interesting that he was in this role. You see many sides of Nick in T3 and Carnivale. I think he will be a force to reckon with once he finds his acting wings.
