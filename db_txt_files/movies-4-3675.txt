Collateral Damage was quite surprisingly good. It provided an interesting look at how the druglords of South America operate, and echoed the growing anti-American sentiments in that region. Like any good Arnold flick, this film had some good action scenes (the best action scene of course was the end). Furthermore, it had a somewhat shocking and explosive ending. Overall, Collateral Damage was a great rebound for Arnold following the somewhat disappointing 6th Day, and is a decent action flick.
