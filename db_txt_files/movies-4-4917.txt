A good family movie. An almost 40 year old man meets himself as an eight year old. Bruce Willis is good as the 40 year old who has ended up a rather nasty person.the little boy is cute. Rusty helps Russ to change himself into a better person. NOt perfect but a pretty good movie for the family to watch.
