This is on scary team. As a Sixers fan, I'm glad to have seen the last of the Hornets this year. The front line is monstrous and absolutely dominates the glass - Traylor, Brown, Moiso, McGloire - these guys battle down low on every single posession. The Hornets also have two legitimate stars in Davis and Mashburn... did anyone see Mashburn's third quarter last night? It was some of the sickest shooting that I've ever seen. If Mashburn doesn't fracture his finger in game 1, I don't think the Sixers pull this series out.
