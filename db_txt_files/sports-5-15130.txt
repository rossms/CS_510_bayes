Love his competitiveness.....have to drag the man kicking and screaming off of the field. Off the charts on the toughness meter (just ask the Giants about trying to stop him with a separated shoulder). Won't quit. Used talent, skill and huge offensive line at Dallas to eventually break Walter's rushing record (yes that did mean something Barry), not to mention 3 rings. True champion playing on guts and desire for a third rate team because he just won't give up the game he loves. Ricky Williams and Barry Sanders could learn alot from this guy!
