Indiana was a great graduate business school. IU offered the academic rigor I needed with fantastic employment opportunities. The curriculum was a balanced mixture of case and lecture delivered by high-caliber staff. I also was able to teach an undergraduate class to defray some of my tuition costs and develop my resume. IU was effective for my business school needs and I graduated with 5 attractive job offers. I use things I learned in my IU MBA every day at work.
