I managed a high volume Churchs Chicken for 15 years. Quality of food and service is determined entirely by management. Quality management was abundant prior to the original company being sold to AFC Enterprises. The original Churchs' operating concept was QUALITY PEOPLE, PRODUCTS, SERVICE, and APPEARANCE. That concept died when AFC took over. Ask any Churchs restaurant manager today to define a thermal barrier. He/she would be clueless.
