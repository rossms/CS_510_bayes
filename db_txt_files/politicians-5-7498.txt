Leader Frist is a man of conscience and character that is committed to public service. He has proven to be a good majority leader, navigating the boisterous tides of the Senate. Before becoming leader, he orchestrated the GOP's regaining of power in the Senate after the Jim Jeffords switch threw the majority to the Democrats. Senator Frist is regarded by most to be in the top tier of candidates for president in 2008.
