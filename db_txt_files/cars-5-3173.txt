just bought 03 4runner. it is great in many ways:..... GOOD: roomy, comfortable, good gas for an SUV, auto temp controler, stereo system, water bottle holders, trash bag holder, looks, power, cool option if you can afford it, you can go offroad with just 2x4..... BAD: no make-ups mirrors for the ladies. hard shock absorber, kinda pricy but much better than other SUVs at that price..... cars i turn down before i bought the 4runner: nissan frontier crewcab, nissan extera, toyota tocoma, honda element, toyota highlander,
