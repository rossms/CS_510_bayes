One of the best looking cars in its class. Sleek and fast. Excellent and legendary history. Came into its one the moment it came off the factory floor. Give up very little to the Supra in termas of some speed and handleing but looks way better in its design and execution. The Supra loks plain compared to this car. Sure its a little faster but, plain non-the-less. Looking forward to next years version which should further blur the line between great looks (the Z) and bland plainess (the Supra)!
