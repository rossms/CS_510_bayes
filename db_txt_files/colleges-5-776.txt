The key to online learning is how much YOU as the learner put into it. Like any class (land-based or otherwise), if you do the bare minimum to get by...you will get a sub-standard education. I am in the MS in O and M program and it is NO cake walk!!!! The people who feel that the education is worthless are not putting the proper effort forward.
