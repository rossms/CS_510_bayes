Again, I was surprised to enjoy Child's Play 2, and since it's a sequel you'd be expecting less then the original, but I got a bit more considering it's a sequel. Chucky was burnt to a crisp by the detective and Andy's mother, but now he's back, and scarier then ever. The toy company has transferred his soul back into the doll, and he is causing havoc to Andy and his foster parents and sister.
