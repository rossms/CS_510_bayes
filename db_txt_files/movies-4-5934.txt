Interesting, entertaining and still creepy after all these years. Boris Karloff is now legendary as the monster. I find it interesting that even though the makeup job done on him was done over a hundred years after the novel was written, it is now taken for granted by everyone that that's the way Frankenstein looks. Dwight Frye is a perfect Fritz. Colin Clive doesn't get as much recognition as he should as the perfect Dr. Frankenstein. Well if I could discover just one of these things...I wouldn't care if they did think I was crazy. And Henry Frankenstein's sarcastic father is hilarious!
