This is a damn fine whisky, I don't care what anyone says. It is a classic, it is very orignal, nothing taste like it. I can take a bottle of Jack carry it around with me all day and drink it right out of the bottle and feel like an Alcholic, good feeling to have and even better when it gets you all mean and fired up, make Jack taste that much better. Men drink Jack Danials, leave the Crown Royal to the Blacks.
