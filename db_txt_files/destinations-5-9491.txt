Amazing museum. One day is not enough, but you're sure to find something interesting for everybody. I loved walking around in an Egyptian pyramid. Where else can you be totally immersed in an ancient time? In other museums you have boring displays behind glass, here you can feel like you are in the Egyptian tomb.
