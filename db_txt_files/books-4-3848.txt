This book captures the sense of isolation and outcast that I was feeling at the time in my life when I read it. An excellent portrayal of a utopian society, but it at the same time raises questions about whose idea of utopia it is, all very relative. A drugged, numb exsistence vs. a sense of inclusion. An excellent read.
