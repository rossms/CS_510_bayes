I drive about 60,000 miles per year. I've owned 6 Celicas, a Supra and a 4Runner (and just bought a vintage Supra). Every single one of them had over 300,000 miles on them when I Sold them in running condition, except the '89 with the 3S-FE engine. (The 4Runner has 309,000 with the 22-R engine and I'm still driving it). The Supras are nothing but Celicas on steroids and are a blast to drive! If you want a car that's fun and dependable and the best looking thing around, go Celica! (Or, you could settle for an inferior Mustang or Camaro if you don't want quality.)
