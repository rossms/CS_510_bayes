Excuse me why is Britney wearing poufy shirts and trying to act so virginal. Plus, what is with that hot guy who has a huge pop-out six pack that looks so horrible!!!! This movie wasn't something I would watch again, and I would not have paid ten dollars to go see it! The only good part of the whole movie was when some guy sneezed and the whole theatre started cracking up. It was soo bad, random people started yelling out, This sucks!! The best actress in the movie was the girl who thought she was all that. Oh, and if you're reading this Britney, cool hillbilly accent. Have fun doing your cousin.
