Amsterdam must have the friendliest atmosphere of any capital city in the world. It's a 'must visit'. Try the Boom Chicago comedy show on the Leidseplein. The comedy and food are great. The Leidseplein has a large selection of bars, clubs, restaurants and 'coffee shops'. The single traveller may find it less threatening than the red light district. Although everyone must visit the red light district at least once even if only in daylight.
