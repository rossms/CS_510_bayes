Tecate is pne of the best beers out of a can. Squeeze a lime wedge down in there and make sure it is icey cold and enjoy a nice refreshing pop. I know that in Mexico, Tectae is looked down upon, but they do not know what they are talking about. Give me a case of this in a super cooler on a hot summer day with some ladies around the pool and I would be a happy little boy.
