In the first game (Syphon Filter) I was able to kill an unlimited number of guys. But in Syphon Filter 2, there were a set amount. The game's speed wasn't fast enough to keep me occupied for long. You see, for me I must have a kind of game that makes my brain hurt otherwise it feels to me that it's not a challenge. My brain tells me that it wasn't really attractive enough for me to even care. But the fact of the matter was, and is, that the fun was really good while it lasted.
