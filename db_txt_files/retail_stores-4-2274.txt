I love the food, selection & prices. Especially the frozen white corn, French green beens & Bambino baby cheese pizzas. Also try the cinnamon yogurt from Italy in the glass containers. DO NOT buy ANY of their brand of cheeses, and inspect bread before buying. I absolutely agree that it often molds before expiration date. I just bought their whipped cream cheese and it has a mold UNDERNEATH the protective plastic and I never even opened it. Today is 7/22 and it expires 8/1. I've had the same luck with their block cheeses. Stay away! Very annoying.
