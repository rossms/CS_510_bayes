After reading this book it will change the way you eat FOREVER. A well detailed book backed with case studies. The scariest thing is that Schlosser actually challenged the fast food restaurants he named in his book to proove that what he was saying was false in a court of law. Company directors at Macdonald's had read his book and they didn't sue, makes you think when MacDonald's sued green peace faster than a bullet for slander back in 1993.
