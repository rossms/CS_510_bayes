I'm from here,but it's not a place I'd choose to move. But if you're here on vacation,Baker's Keyboard Lounge (at Eight Mile and Livernois) is the oldest ongoing jazz club in the world and I'd also recommend the Greektown(which isn't that Greek anymore-but which is where one of the city's three casino's is located) and Mexicantown-which may be the only part of town within city limits to have improved;also-you can take the tunnel bus across the Detroit River to Windsor,Ontario Canada.
