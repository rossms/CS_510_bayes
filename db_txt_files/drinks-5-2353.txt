Christian Brothers Brandy is a smooth almost fruity brandy which a hint of smokey flavor. It s great taste I think is somewhat contributed to by the fact it is aged in oak barrels and made in small batches. It is rather pricey, I paid almost ten dollars for the bottle I bought, but to me it s well worth it.
