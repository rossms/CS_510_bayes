this is my favorite store.... one thing they do that i absolutle hate is the rack flipping for tshirts in which you can hardly see them because there so tightly packed in there... i dont really like some of the prices but there the same prices as at any department store if you exclude sales and mark downs... and i mean i hate the whole buy 2 to get the deal thing like 2 jeans for 55 bux or 1 pair for 40 i meean why would you pay 40bux for jeans when you could get another for 15 but id ya know rather just pay 27.50 or 30... but yea cool store with friendly people
