When I first saw all my friends reading this book, I thought it would probably be a boring book. But after my teacher and a good friend who never recommended anything unless it is so outstanding that he have to told me I have to read this book. I was like 'okay, I will read it'. I was also dying of curiosity to see why so many people I know love this book so much. I had immediately understood when I finished the first chapter. But the rest of the book is just as fun and exciting.
