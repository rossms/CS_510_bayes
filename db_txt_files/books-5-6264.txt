A very interesting book to read. It is a fine introduction to the world of philosophy. If nothing else, it will make you think. Mr. Pirsig writes with a unique style and makes the most complex ideas easily understood. You may also want to read Ron Di Santo and Tom Steele's GUIDEBOOK TO ZEN AND THE ART OF MOTORCYLE MAINTENCE, a great companion piece to Mr. PIrsigs work. Pirsigs other book, LILA is entertaining, but somehow just fails to measure up to the original.
