Dee Brown is a pretty good player. I think that some people do overrate him though. All I hear anymore is that Dee should have been the player of the year and that he should have entered the draft so long ago. Look at what happened tonite though....he didn't show up big and Carolina won the championship....go to hell carolina. Duke'll getcha next year.......
