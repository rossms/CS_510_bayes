He's hung on for too long and that is gonna mess with how he's remembered. Whether SOMEBODY wants to talk about it or not, he led the league in Interceptions last year with 29. Make sure you include that in your stat fest and also remember that the next highest total was 17. His legacy at this point will be that of a great QB who should have hung it up sooner.
