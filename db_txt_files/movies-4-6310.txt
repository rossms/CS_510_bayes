Really a 4.5. A very sweet story about a man who claims to be Santa Claus. Edmund Gwynne is wonderful as the kindly old man who says he is Santa some believe him some do not one thing leads to another and he is put on trial and his lawyer friend must find a way to prove this man is Santa. Natalie Wood was adorable as the 7 yr old whose mother had taught her not to believe in fantasy,and so is Maureen O'Hara as the mom and nonbeliver{at first} I always like to see this at Christmas. A well acted feel good movie. the 1947 version is the best.
