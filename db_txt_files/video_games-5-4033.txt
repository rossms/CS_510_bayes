Although not close to it's brothers on the PS2, XBox, PC, and GameCube, the PSX version still can stand alone as one of the best playstation games ever. Addictive, fun, more engrossing than THPS 1 2, this game is by far the next step in the evolution of the Tony Hawk series and gaming as a whole. I very highly recommend it!
