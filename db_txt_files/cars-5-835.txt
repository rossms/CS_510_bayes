I just got the sorrento at a great bike shop, that said I can tear it up and they will fix it. today it rained in california suprising and iwent up and down a mountain trying my hardest to tear it up, when I had another bike 2 weeks ago made by amx a 600 dollar bike that lasted only 5hrs. through my crazy riding, sorrento I love it.
