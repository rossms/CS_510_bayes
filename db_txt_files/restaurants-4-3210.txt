I have had rather good luck with my local Pappa John's Pizza shop. They supply me with hot fresh product and relatively prompt delivery for a chain shop. About the only pizza better would be made my a couple of mom and pop shops that don't deliver. They are worth walking to some days, mind you. When I'm lazy, Papa John will do in a pinch. :)
