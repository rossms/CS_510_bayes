Daytona is the whitest, hardest beach on the mainland. If you get up before sunup and drive down the beach as morning arrives, you'll never forget it... ever. Take away the crime and the people then clean it up some and you got yourself a vacation spot. Anyway, that's what I said the first time I was there 30 years ago.
