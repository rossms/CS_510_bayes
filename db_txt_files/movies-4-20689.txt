I'm not generally in to musicals, but this is my favorite one. I realize that not everyone appreciates the style of music presented in these types of movies. If you do, it's some of the best of its kind. But even if you don't, the movie is worth seeing for the story. The last part gets really intense. And I tend to become personally attached to those kids each time I see it. It's one of those that is best if you can see it on the big screen.
