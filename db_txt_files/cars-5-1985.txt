I've had an 04 G35 Coupe for several months and have found it to be a great car for me. I don't need space to haul things, I am neither tall nor heavy, I sought a comfortable but not plush vehicle that is stylish, handles very well and is very quick. So it really meets my needs and I love driving it. This is not a car for many folks as it is somewhat limited purpose. I have, and you need, to have other cars to do other things. But, that is true of most sporty vehicles that approach this class, and you will find no better value.
