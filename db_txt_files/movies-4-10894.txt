I dug this movie. I expected Spanglish to be funny and stupid, and found it to be funny and smart. Definitely the best performance that Adam Sandler has given, but it was Tea Leoni that stole the show as the hyper aggressive LA wife. Both daughters were charming in their own way as well. Quick overview: a beautiful Mexican immigrant becomes a maid to a disfunctional LA family. The maid struggles not to have the family rub off too much on her young daughter, and the family struggles to keep it all together.
