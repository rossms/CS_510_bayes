By far, Netflix is the best of the online DVD rental shops and is so much better than dealing with Blockbuster and the rest of those video stores. You never have to worry about late fees, there's a huge selection, and you get free shipping. Plus, with distribution facilities opening up across the U.S., there will be quick delivery to just about everywhere in the country. One thing to keep in mind is that if you don't live in the U.S., you're out of luck.
