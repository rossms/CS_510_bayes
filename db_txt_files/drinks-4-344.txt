Drank my weight in this when i was younger. my uncle worked for the Pittsburgh Brewing Company and they were one of the breweries to manufacture Sam Adams(they no longer do). and my uncle used to give me cases of the mis-labeled brew. loved it. was the first decent beer i drank. but then the aftertaste started to get to me. only have Sammy on a rare occasion now.
