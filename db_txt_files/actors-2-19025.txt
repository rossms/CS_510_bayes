The guy was a few eggs short of a dozen, but he did what he could with a paper thin budget. He made terrible movies, but to this day he is still well known for all of his nonsense and tomfoolery. Worse movies with huge budgets have been made (Battlefield Earth, Tomb Raider) and their are more rediculous plots than that of plan 9 from outer space.
