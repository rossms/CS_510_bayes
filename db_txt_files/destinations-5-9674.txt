It took me about a half pack to get used to there unique flavor, but when I did, I didn't want to put them down. The smoke almost tastes sweet. It somehow reminded me of sweet corn and when I was done smoking it, it left that wonderful Camel taste in my mouth. The turkish royals combine the wonderful camel flavor with a slightly different blend. Try these if you want somthing a little different. They are GREAT
