If you haven't flown Continental RECENTLY, you haven't flown Continental. They just keep getting better and better. Last year, they achieved the BEST on-time performance record of any U.S. airline, as reported by the U.S. Department of Transportation (see www.dot.gov/airconsumer). Their frequent flyer program has been named best in the industry for several consecutive years by the readers of Frequent Flyer magazine. A definite class act among U.S. airlines!
