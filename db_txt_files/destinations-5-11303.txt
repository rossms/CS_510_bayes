Too far to visit often, but when I do I always have fun. I miss a lot of sleep, but there's time for that on the flight back home... Its just unbelievable how much there is to see and do, and not just the gambling (though I do enjoy craps and blackjack!). Flying in at night is an awesome sight, though when I first saw Vegas from the air it looked so much smaller than I imagined. But BOY can they pack a lot of 24 hour fun into a relatively little package!
