Madison was voted the best place to live in America. It's the capital city, has a great University with a great campus, great diverse set of people, it's in a way like a mini-New York. There are people from all over the US and even the world that come here for college and then decide to stay. It's close to Chicago (about 2 hours) and there is always something going on here. There is something for everyone in Madison. If you want to move to Wisconsin, the best place to live would be Madison hands down.
