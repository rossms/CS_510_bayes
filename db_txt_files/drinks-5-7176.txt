I used to have the opinion that this was about the same as Ketel One, but another bartender at my restaurant insisted that Grey Goose is much smoother. So we had a taste test, and threw Skyy, Absolut, and Stoli (our best selling vodka's) in the mix. What we found was that Grey Goose was easily the smoothest going down. Pour a shot of Grey Goose and Ketel One - you will see.
