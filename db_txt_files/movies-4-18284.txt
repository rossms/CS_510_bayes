Fright Night. In the same vein (hehe,pun.) as Lost Boys, a very tounge in cheek approach to vampires and the whole myth in general. A young high school student starts to suspect a vampire has moved in next door. Unfortunatly for him the vampire knows and no one believes him. Not his best friend,his girlfriend or his favorite horror show host. Soon his friend becomes a vampire, his girl is getting jiggy with the bloodsucker and his horror show host is his only hope. Creative and fun little film. Breath of fresh air in an often cliched vampire film world. RCOMMENDED.
