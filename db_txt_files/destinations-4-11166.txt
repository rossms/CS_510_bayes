Ocean City's straight. I spent some time there as a lifeguard and loved it. Sat around all day, partied at night on the beach. The guys had this contest called the Golden Zipper, which this guy Dave won after bringing home over 100 girls that summer. Also Atlantic City and Six Flags are pretty close travel points.
