what's wrong with everyone? this album is the soooo good. it's a good balance between KoRn and Limp Bizkit -i can really relate to the lyrics. i hope the band stays for a while. the lyrics aren't as good as Kurt Cobain's - but no one will ever match his talent. the album is up there with Significant Other, Follow The Leader, In Utero and Nevermind. viva la papa raoch !!!!!
