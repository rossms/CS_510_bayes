Hands down one of the greatest running backs of all time, just looking at his stats for the 2005 season is enough to justify this, not to mention what he has done consistently through his career, all the way back to when he was in Alabama. Anyone who rates him poorly is obviously just jealous that he's not on their team, get over it, give the man the respect he deserves.
