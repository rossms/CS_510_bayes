Killer animation and a killer song. the video is the bomb! They got a pro-animation company to dothe video and the same company did several popular japanese animes and the video kicks some serious butt, if you watch all of daft's vids in a cretian order they tell a story, it;s kinda like a mini series! I think it goes really cool with the music and I love it! I love the song too. It's one of the best current dance jams!!!
