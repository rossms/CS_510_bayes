Apparently unlike the other people who've rated Syria on this website, I've actually been to the country. It's a beautiful and varied place, with amazing Roman, Ommayad crusader ruins. Damascus is just what you'd expect a middle-eastern city to be like - almost out of an Indiana Jones movie. It also has the second most friendly people in the world (after the Jordanians).
