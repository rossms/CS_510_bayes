First of all, I would like to send out a Get Well wish to Michael J. Fox. Fortunately, he has not let his disease get him down totally, as he is returning to his old stomping grounds: animated voices. He did Stuart Little's voice perfectly. His work on Family Ties was pretty good, and his earlier works Teen Wolf and Back to the Future still remain popular even today. Spin City is just not the same without this actor whose promising career was cut way too short. God bless you Michael!
