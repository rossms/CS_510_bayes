Absolutely terrific spot to vacation in the summer. The falls are magnificent and some of the different rides you can do around the falls, like the Maid of The Mist and the Journey Behind The Falls, are exhilirating. There are lots of other attractions in Niagra like the Skylon Tower, The Butterfly Conservatory, and the IMAX theatre. Truly a great spot to go any time of the year.
