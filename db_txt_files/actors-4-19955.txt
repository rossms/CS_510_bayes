With all her films and roles, she just gets better and better. Out of the entire bundle of teen actors and actresses which occupy the movie screen today, she is definately above average. Pkuses (+): She does have range; she plays the good girl hero in Buffy the Vampire Slayer ; The snobby brat in I Know What You Did Last Summer to the conniving B*tch in Cruel Intentions . Minuses (-): She has yet to hit her peak and show all of her true talents, but there is nothing really bad about this actress. She is talented, that is for sure. I hope to see a lot more from this beautiful actress.
