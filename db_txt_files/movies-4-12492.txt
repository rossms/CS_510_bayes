I absolutely LOVED the music and the fact that the actors actually sung for themselves. Even though the Carlotta had to have someone do the singing for her, that woman was still great. It did get a little boring, but of course all movies do once in a great while. The musical scenes were very long but they had astounding mise en scene throughout the entirety of the movie. POTO had such a well built and decorated set. I especially love the Phantom's layer with countless candleabras.
