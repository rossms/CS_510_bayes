Thin Mints and Samoas are running head to head for favorite cookie in our household. Keebler Grasshoppers don't even come close to Thin Mints!!! Girl Scouts is a great organization and the profits from the cookie sales in our council supports not only the troops, but also summer camps, including scholarships for girls!! For $3.00, girls have fun and I get CHOCOLATE!!
