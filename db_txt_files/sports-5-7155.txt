Noone can honestly or sanely argue he's not the greatest of all time. My thoughts are towards the Bulls ownership: what were they thinking disrespecting him and the rest of the players. The owner said if the bulls win the title, keep in mind this was after they had several,they would talk about having everyone back the next year.Why wasen't there outrage over that garbage attitude? I hate to sound mean but I am now glad to see the Bulls in the preverbial cellar.
