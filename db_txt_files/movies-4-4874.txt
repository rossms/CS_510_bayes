I saw this movie in theaters when I was a kid, and loved it...I still kinda do. This is severly underrated by critics. The music, the symbolism, the irony...this should be one of the those classic movies, but critics ignore it. It wasn't perfect though, and I can think of things that could have made it better..in my opinion anyway. Anyway, this should be considered a classic, even though as of this writing, it's only 11 years old. Hoffman was amazing.
