this cd is a cool one. I love the arrangemants on this one. I think the tracks tearing up my heart , I want you back , giddy up and I need love are the coolest dance-flav tracks on this disc,I love the arrangemats and I love all three the same. I also think the track this is promise you is a nice slow jam that is really relaxing and cool. I also like the song I just wanna be with you is a good r-n-b track that's good for the road. I love this disc!!
