pros: good phone, speakerphone is very very loud. the screen is one of the best ive seen on any phone. its huge, and the color saturation is beautiful. menu navigation is easy, but if youre coming from nokia or another company, it takes a little time to get used to, but its a very easy meny system. messaging is easy, email works great, so does wap. camera picture quality is great for a VGA. cons: over time, the phone's software slows down alot. thats my only major complaint. earpeice volume could be louder. other than that, this is a great phone.
