I have been with Verizon for quite a few years now and they have always been helpful.. As a woman being alone and most of the time traveling alone I feel very safe having a phone I know will work where ever I am.. Got a flat one time and the spare was stuck in the trunk could not pry it loose called for help and not once lost my signal..If I had I really don't know what I would have done not many cars were going by and it was late at night...Thanks Verizon for the Great connections...
