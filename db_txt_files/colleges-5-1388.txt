For all of those apprehensive high school seniors (and probably their parents too), I recommend looking no further than UVa for an Ivy League-caliber education that is counterbalanced by a diverse student body of immense talent and ambition, professors who genuinely care, and a social life that serves as a perfect means of diversion from the academic rigors of studying at an upper-echelon university.
