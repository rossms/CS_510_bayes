I had a 1992 Camry....GREAT CAR!! Great Mileage little maintanence. Definitely got my moneys worth. My salesman was right when he pointed to the Hazard button told me, this is one button you will never use on this car. He was right! I just bought a Highlander it rides just as well as my Camry except it's higher. I highly recommend both.
