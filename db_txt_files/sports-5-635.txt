Back when Atlanta had the best rotation in baseball history, Maddux was THE stud of the lineup. He may not have had the most impressive fastball in the league, but no one had more class. He got people out; not necessarily through K's but through chucking balls that were impossible to line drive. I hope that this particular SOB attains the Hall of Fame, or I will lose all faith in baseball altogether.
