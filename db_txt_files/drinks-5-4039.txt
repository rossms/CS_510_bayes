This has got to be one of the best out there. For those Tech N9ne fans in the crowd you CANNOT beat a well made Caribolu (151, Malibu, pineapple juice). That stuff goes down so smooth! New Years Eve I had 8 glasses of that stuff (equiv. to about 40 beers), felt great and had no hangover the next day! Can't beat that.
