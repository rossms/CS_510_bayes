Ford's acting ability and Jones' commanding screen presence combine for a great film in The Fugitive. Dr. Richard Kimble (Ford) is on the run after being falsely accused of murdering his wife. As he searches for the truth and seeks to prove his innocence, U.S. Marshal Sam Gerard is on his tail. Most memorable was Jones' performance as the cold and savvy Gerard, a character that would be revived five years following the release of The Fugitive in U.S. Marshals. Overall, The Fugitive is a good flick with lots of action and a decent plotline that has a limited element of suspense.
