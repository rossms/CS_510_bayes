Agree completely with StanUzbeck (just one correction-most affluent states of India are Punjab and Haryana, which are in North) and MC1966, a great place with fantastic sights, wonderful culture, rich heritage, stong moral and ethical values, generally well informed people, diversity beyond comparison in everything - language, climate and religion, less chances of being mugged in a city. Still, considering its pollution, dirt, disorganization, heat and crowds, not for a casual tourist. Could be a wonderful experience however if you know somebody there.
