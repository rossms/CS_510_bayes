For the longest time, I thought that Kent was not all that good and that his 100 RBI seasons were flukes and due primarily to hitting behind Barry Bonds who seems to always be on base. But this year, I have been convinced otherwise. He is a great hitter. His average is well over .300 and he will once again drive in well over 100 runs. It was great to see the fans rally for him and get him voted in as the starting second baseman at the All-star Game.
