They came in, and really brought the county up to the current tech. Before Edge Wireless, all we had was US Cellular, and the refused to spend any money expanding their network. The holes were many, and the customer service was, that we had no choise, it was either them or noone. Edge has been great, spending the nessary money to build a solid system, and the customer service is the best that I have dealt with.
