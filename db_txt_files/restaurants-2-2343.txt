I never was real big on this place. I mean that battered fish ain't too bad unless you eat a lot of it.....then it's just too greasy and sickening. The LJS in my town went out of business a few years ago....I guess because people around here like real seafood. Anyway I'd rather go eat a pile of boiled shrimp and crawfish than anything from this place any day.
