San Francisco is truly one of the greatest cities in the United States if not the world. The city manages to find a balance between the natural environment (the bay, hills, fog) and the built environment. Coit Tower, the Golden Gate Bridge, and the Transamerica Pyramid are architectural gems. San Francisco's diversity and tolerance is also refreshing. Although its cost of living is excessive, I can only make the argument that you pay for what you great. From its clanging cable cars to its eclectic neighborhoods (Haight, Mission, Castro, etc), San Francisco is all around a great city.
