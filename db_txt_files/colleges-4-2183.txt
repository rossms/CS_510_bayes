I graduated from Cal Poly Pomona in 1990. The education was a great value (tuition $600/yr compared to the $15-$20K/per year at private schools) but the social scene sucked. It is a commuter school with very little going on nearby. Most people commute long distances to the school and they take off as soon as class is over. Also, there is a ghetto on the edge of campus where you can purchase crack cocaine or cheap prostitutes. The best things are the proximity to LA and its 45 minutes from the closest ski slopes.
