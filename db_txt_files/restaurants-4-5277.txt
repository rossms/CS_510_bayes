Fazoli's is good for fast food Italian meals. If you are in a hurry and want a change of pace there are some decent meals. it always comes with breadsticks. and if you stay there you get unlimited breadsticks.{at least the last time we went there you did} It will not be as good as an authentic sit down restaurant. It is not badly priced there and pretty good food.
