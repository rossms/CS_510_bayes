A tough one. Under a different system and on a different team and this guy may not have lasted 5 years in the pros. But the end results are hard to argue with. Made huge plays and always seemed to win any game that mattered. I was never very impressed with his skills but his personality seemed genuine and his achievements are amazing. Strikes me as better suited to be an actor than athlete.
