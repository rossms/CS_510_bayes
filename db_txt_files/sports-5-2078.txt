A lot of players had career years for the Dbacks last year so this years expectations should be tempered a little bit. I dont think the Dbacks can duplicate the 100(100-62)plateu but will come close. Of all the players Travis Lee looks to be the player who couldnt possibly play worse than last year. Expect Bell, Gonzo and Matty to play a little worse or fall back to their norm. Of all the teams in the west it looks like the Dodgers have made the moves to challange Arizona.
