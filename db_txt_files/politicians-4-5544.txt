I respect this man for his accomplishments and initiatives since he took office in 2000. He is a leading advocate in protecting the Social Security System and extending Medicare benefits to provide affordable prescription drug coverage to our elderly citizens. Senator Corzine introduced legislation that directs states to put together plans to deal with the threat of biological or chemical attacks. He also cosponsered legislation providing a two year tax break to victims of the terrorist attacks. He is also against racial profiling. Seems to be a good man who earned his way to the top.
