If you are in the generation that read Graham Greene, you shall really enjoy this movie. It takes place in Viet Nam during the French days. Michael Caine is a broken down British correspondent who has a Vietnamese mistress. A brash American who works for the CIA, we find out, wants to take Caine's mistress back to America. Caine betrays the American, the Quite American, to the Viet Minh, the Communists in the French Days.
