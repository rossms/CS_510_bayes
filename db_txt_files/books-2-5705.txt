Ever since I read Circle of Friends I've been a loyal follower of Maeve Binchy and I was very excited about reading this book. From what was printed on the backside I thought it would be a light, warm and compassionate story but it never quite gets there. Cathy strikes me as a spoiled little girl, Tom as a pushover twit and why Maud and Simon were even introduced is beyond me. This is the first book of hers I've read that takes place somewhere between the 80's/90's, and I must say I enjoy her 40's/50's work. This book had a lot of promise, but failed to keep them.
