Howard Jones won more football national championships at more different universities than any coach in the history of college football. He won at Yale (1909), at Iowa (1921), and at USC (1928, 1931, 1932, and 1939). He is also one of only a handful of college coaches to have his portrait on the cover of Time Magazine (e.g. Knute Rockne, Wallace Wade, Frank Leahy, etc.). Check out what Dan Jenkins had to say about him in his book "Saturday"s America".
