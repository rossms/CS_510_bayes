Probably one of my all time favorite restaurants. The menu is limited but I believe it is because they care about the quality of the food. The spinach and artichoke dip is by far the best there is anywhere. I don't know where gy-rater is from but I live in Memphis and the Houston's here has been around for 20 years and it was never just a steak house.
