Readable and entertaining at times. But it does not compare to Angels & Demons or DaVinci Code. As outstanding a writer as Dan Brown is, after reading a couple of his books, you can almost decipher how the book is going to end halfway through. Like Dr. Langdon, I figured it out quite early and was skimming through the last 100 pages or so. I didn't even bother to read the last 10 pages (If you know Dan Brown, you know what's going to happen, nudge, nudge, wink, wink, hominah, hominah).
