Yeah, Washington sure is nice, with all the architecture and statury and monuments...overlooking crowds of shuffling homeless people and crack dealers. It is a very appropriate American capital - filled with a lot of large phallic monuments and the highest rate of violent crime in the country. I hope this city gets wiped off the face of the planet by some God-sent catastrophe.
