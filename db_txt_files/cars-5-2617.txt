This car is the nicest car I own by far. The exterior is great, the speed is soo nice, and the engine sound is deep and pure. With the 6.0 V12 engine, and 25,000pound sounds system as standard, this is a beast of a car. It completely beats my 575, and the diablo II. I love this car. Its got class and style.
