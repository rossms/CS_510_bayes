I used to love reading these books when I was younger. I would always beg my mom to bring home the latest issue so I can read about the latest adventures of Kristy, Claudia, Stacey, and the rest of the gang in the fictional town of Stoneybrook, Connecticut. I think the girls are good role models for younger girls. The series never seemed to run out of steam, although I personally stopped at around book #60. I highly recommend this series for girls ages 8-13.
