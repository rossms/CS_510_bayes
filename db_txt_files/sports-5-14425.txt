Steve Young HAS to rank up there with the greats. He did have a solid supporting cast around him and he utilized them all well. Steve was a competitor and most importantly a WINNER. He made a difference on the field. Can't say that about A LOT of other QBs. Also he was a helluva politician dealing with personalities like: Rice, Montana, Walsh, Waters, Seifert, and not to mention the media.
