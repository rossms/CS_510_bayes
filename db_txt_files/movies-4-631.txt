One of the best movies about Vietnam (aren't they all?) But this one is different because of the boot-camp segment, which, PB is correct in pointing out, is the BEST part of the movie. Great chararacter development during this segment. But then it does lose something after that. It seems most of the great war movies suffer from agonizing slowdowns at somepoint... but this one is different, it's very much like watching 2 seperate movies, one obviously better than the other. But still a classic! No one better than Kubrick.
