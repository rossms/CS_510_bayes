Starbucks is the best coffee I've ever tasted. Yes it's a little pricey, but thinking in terms of value, I'd rather pay 4 bucks for a great latte than 3.25 for one that tastes like it came out of a can. That small difference is an easy choice for me. Also knowing their commitment to purchasing Fair Trade coffee is huge, and I'll pay a little more for that too....and oh yeah I'm addicted...but I don't smoke or drink so I'm allowed a vice like Starbucks.
