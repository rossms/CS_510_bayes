absolutely beautiful. the people on here that rate it bad are bringing politics into their ratings, which is garbage. people want to know about the state, not their political views. it's a beautiful state with rolling hills, beautiful beaches, amazing scenery, and the people are the nicest around -- i wouldn't have it any other way. i love alabama. come and visit yall and get a real taste of the south.
