Alex is a great shortstop and a great person. He may not be worth that much money but nobody is and there is not a single person on this planet who would turn down an offer like that. I wouldn't and I know you wouldn't. Cut the guy some slack he is only human after all. I am actully looking forward to seeing A-Rod in a Ranger uniform and he knows that signing such a big contract that the pressure is on him to do even better than he has been. I think he will have an awsome year. Go A-Rod!
