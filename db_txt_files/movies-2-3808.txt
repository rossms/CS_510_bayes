I love the first movie, so when I heard the second one was coming out I was so excited. People had told me not to waste my money, but did I listen? Oh no, I had to see it for myself, i figured t couldn't be bad. I was wrong. The plot was flimsy at best, the script seemed like they were trying to hard to be funny. It lacked the charm of the first one, and the chemistry between the actors just didn't seem like it was as strong as it was in the first one. My recomendation is to just see the first one over again, and save your money.
