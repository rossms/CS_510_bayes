I like Fidelity. Good service, good features. I'm not that crazy about their website, even though they've changed it several times it always seems to be a bit of a put off. I guess just not that user friendly or bland looking or something but that doesn't really reflect on their service which is quite good. I also like that their prices are more reasonable that Schwab.
