I love macaroni grill! It's fantastic and for all of the people who are commenting that the atmosphere is to loud, I suggest not dining at a family style Italian restaurant. If you knew the anything about Italian restaurants you would have realized this before going there. The atmosphere is loud, energetic and fun! It's a great place for the whole family. And I strongly suggest ordering something other than spaghetti or meatballs, they have wonderful dishes. Go for something out of the ordinary!!!
