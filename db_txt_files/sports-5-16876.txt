how can you be lucky to win 3 super bowls!? luck has nothing to do with it. tom brady has a TEAM around him where everyone makes plays everyone. although the focus is on team, tom brady is still one of the best QB's in the league. altough manning and roethlisberger are better. but what can i say, go pats!
