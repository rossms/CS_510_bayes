Had the opportunity to test drive an M Roadster and found it to be a lot of fun with power to spare and superlative braking however the rear view mirror was too imposing for such a small windshield and obviously the price on this machine puts it out of the reach of most. I settled on a 100% restored 1968 Camaro SS. Not much of a let-down there. I still turn most heads and I've got a piece of nostalgia
