I recetnly had a terrible exp with TDW, and I have been a customer for years. My father (also an account holder) passed away, and the service I got from TDW was just terrible in terms of incorrect and conflicting information. Also, I have reason to believe they gave incorrect information to my father regarding his beneficiary setup based on his administrative papers and dated/signed documents from TDW. And this when he was 75 years old.
