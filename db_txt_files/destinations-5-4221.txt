Wonderful conservative city on the up and coming. Many people say Jacksonville is full of dumb, ignorant, rednecks - if that were so then Fidelity Financial would not have recently relocated their headquarters to Jax from L.A. I've lived in NYC, Washington, DC and Boston. Believe me when I say that the people of Jacksonville are no dumber than any of them! I hang my hat in Ponte Vedra Beach - it's the best uncommercialized part of FL.
