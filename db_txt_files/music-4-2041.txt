No one should ever ever hate this band they are the all time best ever. Sure, I agree this is their worst ever release but listen to Riot act to hear their return form? How can anyone of any background or race deny that they are pure art and pure expression in it's finest form? The songs worth checking out from this release are insignificance and rival these are excellent.
