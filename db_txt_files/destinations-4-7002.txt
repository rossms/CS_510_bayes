London is a great city to visit, there is so much to see and do. You can walk for miles and never get bored. There is a wonderful sense of history about the place as well. Sure it's busy and crowded but this all adds to the excitement for me. I've never had a problem with the people in London either. Wouldn't want to live there myself as I think I would be overwhelmed...and the prices are quite high. Nice place though.
