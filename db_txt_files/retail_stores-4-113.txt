It's a bit of a split decision for me. It's a decent enough store-- with some good prices-- if you have a couple of hours to kill just looking around and picking up anything that looks appealing. However, if you're looking for a SPECIFIC book, it's a completely hit-or-miss proposition. Not only that-- but they have the ability to check their central web site for availability of a given book... but even if they FIND it, they have no idea which store has it. And with a 100+ stores, that means you might as well have stayed at home and ordered it online.
