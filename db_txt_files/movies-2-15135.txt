At the time this movie came out, I was just a child. And because of this, I felt the depression of the adults and the child in this movie really heavily. It was a depressing drama from beginning to end, and it wasn't a good sadness like in other movies. As an adult, I watched it one more time to see if my review would change, but I still just don't care for this movie. It is almost like a Lifetime movie, but worse if that is possible. !
