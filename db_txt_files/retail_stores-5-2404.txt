I enjoy shopping at Farmer Jack because of their fresh food and many varieties. Not to mention their friendly workers. Of course not all locations give their 100%, but that's no reason to give up on the entire company. I've been in a couple of bad Walmart's but I dont stop shopping at all of them. Folks stop being so critical.
