A very strong documentary film maker, with a good sense of history. Very good narrative skills, and while he sometimes gets sidetracked into pet themes, he presents a clear and legitimate vision of his topic. By the by Moosekarloff, I suspect you don't understand much about baseball to call Burns' film thin and poorly focussed. It had a level of clarity and love of the game that is very hard to equal.
