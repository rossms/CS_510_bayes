Like the majority of all southern states, South Carolina is superb as well. I love the people, places and things....so to speak. It is beautiful here, as are the people. I highly recommend Charleston and Myrtle Beach to tourists. And the men, they are just so great here. So polite and down to earth, and cute too ! :)
