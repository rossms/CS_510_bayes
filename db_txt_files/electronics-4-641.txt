I currently own the SCH-3500, and so far I am pleased with it. I've always liked flip-phones (so you don't accidentally press keys). Lots of useful features on the phone, including voice dialing, wireless web, and ability to record voice memos. The phone's physical dimensions (minus antenna/folding cover) are almost identical to Nokia's 8890, which is perhaps the best phone on the US market. Also, phone features dual mode (analog/digital PCS)- always useful.
