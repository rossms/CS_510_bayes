If you like trivia, and useless facts then this is a fun and interesting book. For instance In the Fall of 1980 The National Committee on Television Violence named the show Enos as the most violent. In Odd Jobs of 35 Celebrities Marlon Brando was a department store elevator operator. Those are just examples from The Book of Lists The 90's edition.
