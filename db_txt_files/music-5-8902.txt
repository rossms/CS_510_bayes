This video is so cool. Pink has a bright future ahead of her if she contuines to do work as good as this. She's not afraid to show people who she is and what her life has been. I think artists today are a bit to serious about themselves and their songs. If you have a cool song with personal lyrics, you should do a video that is joyfull and will make people laugh at you. 'Cause Pink is just great. (I love her hair now that it's a bit more blonde)
