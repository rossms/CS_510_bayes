Really good characterization. Impressive for an action flick. He (the main character) does a lot of unexpected things that catch you off guard. Kudos to the choreographer. Another thing I liked is that he's not a superhero. Too often in action films is the protagonist GOGOGO until the win. In 'The Transporter', you can see him tire, you see him struggle, you see him get hurt. You can see he's human. It's nice for a change.
