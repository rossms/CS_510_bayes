Capital in one oif the best vacation destinations I know of. Great golf in the city with Chapman and Royal Harare etc. BUT don't stay in Harare: Travel to victoria falls and enjoy great rafting on the Zambezi or go to the eastern Highlands and relax, walk and play 18 or even 2 x 18 on the fantastic Leapard Rock Golf Club. Walking safaries in Kariba is even a must, and for those who really want to do something else canoing a week in the wilderness of Mana Polls is ... something else. Keep clear of the Hippos and crocs though!
