Bush gets a bum rap on many issues, especially the economy and jobs. At this point, I can't rate him as a great president, but he has taken the terrorism bull by the horns and at least attempted to do what has to be done. I do think that he needs to come across as a lot more forceful in his appearances. He ought to talk more like he's from Connecticut rather than just lazing along with that down home Texas twang.
