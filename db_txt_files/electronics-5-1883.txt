By far the best system on the market. I'm so tired of the whiners saying that the PS2 has better games. No... the PS2 has MORE games. In 2003 the X-Box has greatly improved its game library, and any game that is on both the PS2 and the X-Box looks superior on the latter. Plus the X-Box has a pretty decent-sized hard drive that can hold countless game files and loads of songs. The Game Cube sucks, it can't do anything other than play games. But comparing the X-Box to the PS2 is like comparing a Thai hooker (XB) to an American hooker (PS2). You get more bang for the buck with the X-Box. (Thai hooker).
