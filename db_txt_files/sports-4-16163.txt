He's strong and balanced, a workhorse. He gets his pads low inside, and he's hard to stop. He finds the soft spots, pops in the hole, and comes out the other side with a head full of steam. He's got a lot of explosiveness for a guy who's 234 pounds. He goes straight ahead to the line, waits on his blocks, tippy-toes in and out. He's just not a power runner who attacks the hole. And he won't take over a game like an Emmitt Smith or Terrell Davis.
