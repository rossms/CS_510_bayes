It sure makes me sad when I have to but crappy turkish golds silvers or royals... . or camel lights fir that metter. I love these, and I will only buy (if available...) Lucky for me, and I have no idea why this is, but at my campus store they sell 'em for like 4 buckS!!! so thats tight. Erbody I give these things to - which I often acquiesce to - loves them!GO KAMEL!
