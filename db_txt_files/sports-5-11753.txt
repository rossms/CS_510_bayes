Walker is by far the greatest. Ron Dayne, Ricky, 4 years to break hersch's marks. O yea to the comments on college classes; I looked at the topic on this page and its about FOOTBALL. The comments probably came from someone who attended a run of the mill institute or junior college and spent 5 or 6 years and 60,000 dollars of daddy's cash to wrap up a bussiness degree and their schools only athlete to speak of was in the early 50's or playing arena 2 now. So now they live vicariously through U.S.C., Miami, Texas or whatever school is doing good this year.
