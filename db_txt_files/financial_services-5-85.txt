All banks charge fees. All banks hold checks that are deposited based upon where the check is from. I know that when I opened my account they provided me with a listing of all of the fees that they charge. You have an option to close the account whenever you wish. If you go overdraft, then it is your fault, not the bank's. When are you going to take responsibility for your actions. I have had a few overdrafts and I felt like a jerk, I did not blame the bank for doing what they said that they would do if I did. Grow up and be a responsible adult!
