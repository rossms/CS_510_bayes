she and julia roberts, those actresses pretty much made for romantic comedies. i've seen this woman in a few dramatic roles, like proof of life and courage under fire. considering proof of life was badly written and she didn't get much to say or do in courage under fire, she didn't do too bad of a job. but i've never felt particularly moved by her, either.
