I've been drinking coffee for 50 years all over the planet. My favorite is from the island of Sulawesi In Indonesia. It's name is Kalosi Toraja. It was a Dutch gourmet coffee. A very close second is what looks like a generic brand. It used to only come in a red package and it is 8 o'Clock Bean. I prefer the Columbian whole bean variety which comes in a flavor lock 13 oz. bag. Pricing was around $3.00/bag although it seems to have just gone through a price hike. I just saw it today at the local supermarket chain for $4.29. Still worth the money.
