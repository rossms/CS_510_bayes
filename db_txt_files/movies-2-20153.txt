I could have just as easily given this one a Terrible but I was in a good mood. But it truly stinks. Brandy should not be allowed to act. Jennifer Love is better but aside from her looks it gets old. And don't even mention the guy with Brandy and Jennifer's date on the trip to God-knows-where. Horrible acting, a ridiculous plot with our cutey-pie boy rescuing the day again. Please Hollywood, let up on the teen flicks.
