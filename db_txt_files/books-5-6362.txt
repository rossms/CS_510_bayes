This book is absolutely fascinating and a definite must-read for any red-blooded American. The facts are troubling but must not be overlooked. I admire Pat Buchanan for putting forth the effort to put together such a needed collection of facts and ideas despite their unpopularity in our current society. I recommend this to anyone and everyone.
