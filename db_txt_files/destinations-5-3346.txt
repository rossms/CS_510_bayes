From what I remember of New Orleans, which isn't much even though I've been there a few times, it's an amazing city. What strikes me the most is how different it is from most U.S. cities - you're not going to slip and think you're in Detroit at any point. There's an unmistakable undercurrent of something unique, slightly foreign, and completely out of reach to an idiot tourist like me.
