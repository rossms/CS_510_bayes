The pre-steroid Bonds was a very good hitter and fielder and an almost lock as a Hall of Famer.The post steroid Bonds made him a monster Home Run hitter on top of the average.He deserves to be remembered as a great player, but his HR numbers should be disallowed, including the single season record he owns.
