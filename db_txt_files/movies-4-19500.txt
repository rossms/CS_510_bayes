This movie, along with many of the horror movies from the 80's is better suited to the comedy section. Some of the clothes, hair styles, pranks, and one-liners had me in laughter the entire time. I wish horror movies today were a lot less cynical, less politically correct, and relied less on special effects. Horror movies should concentrate on having fun like this one did
