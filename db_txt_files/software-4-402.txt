As an average computer user, I would have to say that DOS essentially died upon the release of Windows 95, which wasn't just a shell that sat on top of DOS like the previous versions of Windows, but was an operating system itself. In many ways, DOS is like your old bicycle once one gets their license to drive. It served well for many years without much complaint, but it is too difficult to go back. As other comments have noted, the system was cryptic and not very user friendly, though it rarely (if ever) crashed. The bottom line is four stars for serving the industry for so long and so well.
