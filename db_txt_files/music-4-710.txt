This album surprised me. I was expecting hard rockin' guitar riffs with that 70s feel, but instead it's a non-stop party album which took me a while to get used to but the more and more I did, I can appreciate Lenny's ability to branch out to different sounds. He is truly not a one dimensional artist. A great turnaround from the dark and moody Circus album.
