Ruin Mist what? That was my reaction when all the hoopla started over the release of these books. My kids are 17 19 now, so it's been awhile since I was shopping for books for them. I remember reading reviews of the other series...but must have dismissed them because my boys were too old for that. Too old?! Well, their not. These books are for everyone. I'm buying them all.
