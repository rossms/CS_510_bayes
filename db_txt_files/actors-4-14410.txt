I thought as a child actress, she was wonderful. I even liked a couple of her more recent movies. However, now that she seems to be everywhere.....I'm starting to feel like she is wearing out her welcome. I really wish she'd tone herself down. I like her, and the way she is going...she's going to burn out her shining star. As for her image, I really dislike the blonde hair on her. The red hair was one of the things that made her so striking.
