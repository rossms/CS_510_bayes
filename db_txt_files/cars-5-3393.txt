I own a 2003 Rav4L 4wd. It has almost every option but the best thing is....drum roll..it's a toyota. It's a very smooth quiet car/suv with excellent cargo room for it's class. Yeah it could use more power, but hey, it's a small suv...isn't that the point..to be good on GAS?...you can't have everything PEOPLE!! Versitility is its trademark, the rear seats fold down move forward or come out completely...leave the left or right one in individually for a 3rd person and your good to go.
