Todd, you are wrong. SDSU is highly respected, and some of the programs rank in the top twenty nationally. Because it is in San Diego, CA, it suffers from a party school reputation, but read the recent news about some of the other top universities and you'll see the same type of incidents (frat parties, hazings, etc.). The SDSU campus is also outstanding, and you cannot beat the weather.
