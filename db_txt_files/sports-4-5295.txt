Breaking and holding the Butler/Hinkle fieldhouse record with 57 points as a highschool senior was a good start. This is where Oscar and team made history in 1955 and 1956. Alford won the NCAA at Indiana U. A great shooter, play maker, and clutch free throw shooter, but what I liked best was his ability to take the ball right through two defenders when being double teamed. I am glad he is at Iowa as I can add them to our big 5 in Indiana.
