This place is SO OVER-RATED and OVER-PRICED!!! The atmosphere is cool and the customer service has always been good. The food there is terrible. I've tried many of the dishes there and have been unsatified by everyone of them. I guess the people who rate it at five stars have only eaten chinese at the food court in a mall.
