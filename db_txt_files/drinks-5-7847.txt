I have tried many types of whiskey and believe I have a rather discerning and critical taste when it comes to things like this, as well as fine wines. Jack Daniel's Whiskey is the best tasting whiskey I have ever tried. It mixes excellently with Coca Cola, and is great as a straight shot if you so dare. I would recommend this to anyone who likes a rich, full taste with an unmatched, wooded flavor.
