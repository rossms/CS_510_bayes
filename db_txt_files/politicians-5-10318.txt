Tough, gutsy, yet compassionate conservative leader who vexes both side by outspending Democrats and on the one hand and being an outspoken advocate for the unborn on the other. His whipping of Usama Bin Laden and Saddam Hussein have convinced Libya to surrender and terminated its weapons of mass destruction programs. Excellent job, W! You're just what the country needed during a tough time in our history!
