A musical that I was brought up on. Yes, this truly belongs in the classical movies section. Beautiful songs that have lasted (well, my mum still sings them round the house) and v original at the time. Only small hitch is the beginning scene, where the guys all click their fingers in time, and try and look macho too. Bit of a contradiction in terms, I thought, but carried off as well as could be expected by the actors.
