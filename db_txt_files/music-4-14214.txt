I enjoy what I call the professional songs on here like Grease, You're The One That I want, and Summer Nights. However, the ones like Beauty School Dropout and Stranded at the Drivein (Sandy) are pretty lame when just hearing them on a cd. They are fine in the movie but hearing them just by themselves they definitely lose something.
