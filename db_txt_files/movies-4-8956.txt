I don't like Jim Carrey. I don't like him as an actor or comedian. He always does the same facial expression and I am tired of it. I did like the idea of the movie though. And even though I was over Carrey, I enjoyed the thought of being god for a while. Where did they come up with that idea? Morgan Freeman as god? I think that is hilarious. There were some pretty good jokes. A good movie to have on DVD.
