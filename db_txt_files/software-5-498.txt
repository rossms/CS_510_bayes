Rating:4.6 :: great image editing software! You can also make websites with (my fav feature)pop-up navagations! you can also add alot of textures to text and make it look all flashy! I also like the fact that it gives you a ton of imaging options. The only gripe is that it can be RAM/CPU cycle hungry. I recommend running win2000/XP (or on linux with most of the vutual machine/win-Lin environments aval.) with more than 128MB RAM/ 750+MHZ PIII/AMD duron/atlon Processor and 16MB Video memory for graphic intensive websites.
