Visited Geneva and Montreux recently. To put it in words of Herge', the Belgian cartoonist (of Tintin fame), it is probably the most beautiful, precise, organized and above all, cleanest place in the world. Certainly the place to go if one wants peace of mind in a serene location. Do visit the nearby Chateaux de Chillon by Lake Geneva if you happen to be there.
