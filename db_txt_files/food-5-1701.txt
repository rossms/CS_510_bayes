definetly the best licorice out there. Both twizzlers and nibs (the tiny licorice pieces made from the same company) are great. Although I can't stand black licorice I love strawberry twizzlers and cherry nibs. The texture is just right, not hard like most other kinds but chewy and soft. Not too sweet either, the balance is really right on.
