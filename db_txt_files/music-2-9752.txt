Sucks! I'm glad I won this CD off the radio because purchasing this album could possibly be the worst mistake you could ever make. Except for the title track which can (arguably) be slightly catchy, the rest of her songs leave nothing to be desired...except to toss the CD out of your window and cry about the $15 you spent on it. Definitely not her best work.
