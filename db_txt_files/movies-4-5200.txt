Good movie! But Mike Myers said something that was inappropriate for a kids' movie. This movie changed my opinion of Myers. Alec Baldwin was funny. Sean Hayes is obviously talented but wasn't funny. The Mom was awful. The movie went from dead to good after she departed from the body of the story. Fun movie.
