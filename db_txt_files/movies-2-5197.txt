I heeded the critics warnings and kept my family from seeing this at the cineplex. Some of the reviews were downright scthing. I waited for a boring Sunday afternoon, while I had to clean the garage, and rented it for 99 cents at Blockbuster. The only reason I didn't give it a 1 was that my kids seemed to like it for its stupidity. My wife said it stunk. The 5 minutes I saw of it actually made me head for the garage. What's next, The Lorax, starring Chris Rock.
