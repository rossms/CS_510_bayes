Very well written and entertaining for the young, very thought provoking and entertaining for the older reader. C S Lewis uses a children's fantasy format to show his views on Chritianity. The Witch, the Lion and the Wardrobe tell the story of Christ from a different perspective and is a wonderful parable. Read these to your kids, you will both enjoy the story.
