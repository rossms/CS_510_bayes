I was so happy when i heard that White Castle was coming to my home town. I have always heard of this restaurant, never been to one. I went there shortly after they finally opened. and my reaction was hmmmmm. this is great? The hamburgers were very greasy, and we had ours without the onion. the fries were not hot enough. I do not think I will be back.
