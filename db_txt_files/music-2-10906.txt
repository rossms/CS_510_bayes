Mandy Moore's latest album, I Wanna Be With You, has a total of six original, no, take that back, new songs. The others are remixes of her old ones. I say, don't sell a half completed album. Some of them they don't even bother to remix. Candy is the only worthwhile song, but you could have gotten that on her last CD!
