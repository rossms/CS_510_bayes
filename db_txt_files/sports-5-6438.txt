They are amazing. They always have been. They had a great showing this year and I thought from the beginning they would go all the way. They can up a little short in the end, but i think they could have and should have won the game. They have had great players like Paul Pierce come out from the Jayhawks who now plays for the Celtics and now they will have Collison and Hinrich (the best player EVER in the world) come into the NBA and I am confident that they will be awesome!
