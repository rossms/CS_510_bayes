The new Buick is a really great SUV. Its marketed wrong by Buick, however. This, and the Aztec, all share the same design. The Aztec is a midsize disaster, and the Buick is a 7 passenger mid size SUV. The only one that stands out in any way is the Buick. Its the only one to offer a 3rd row, and has the most room inside. Its based on a minivan, so you get SUV capability with minivan seating comforts. Reliability won't be the highest, but everything else in this SUV is average or above average.
