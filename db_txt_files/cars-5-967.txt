A fantastic automobile. My 1991 Accord just rolled over 200k miles, and still drives like it did when it was new. I've never had any mechanical problems with it--only time it's in the shop is for regular maintenance. I've driven newer Accords on occasion, and they too drive and handle among the best. I know that the day will come when I'll have to give up my Accord, but when I do, rest assured that I'll seriously consider another Honda product.
