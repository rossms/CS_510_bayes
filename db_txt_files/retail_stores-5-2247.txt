Publix is an excellent supermarket chain. Unlike most other supermarkets, Publix always has the freshest products available. Their deli is great, the fruits are always fresh and most anything you need for food can be found here. Also, it's a very well run company with good employees. It's growing very fast, especially from where I come from in the southeast.
