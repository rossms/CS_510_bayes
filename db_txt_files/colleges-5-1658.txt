As a recent graduate from the School of Foriegn Service, I feel one of Georgetown's best assets are its professors. Many come from the field rather than academia-- they do or have worked at the Fed, CIA, State Dept, etc-- and provide a fresh and practical perspective. They also make great contacts after graduation.
