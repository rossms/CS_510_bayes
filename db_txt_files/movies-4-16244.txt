 The Red Violin is based on a really clever idea. The show follows the history of a violin from the time it was made in Italy in the 1600s to present day. Done in a flashback format, the movie shows the violin passing through the hands of many different people living all over the world. It's amazing to see the effect this violin had on people's lives. The movie got off to a slow start, but I was definitely hooked after 30 minutes or so. The soundtrack added a lot, too. This movie is definitely worth a rental.
