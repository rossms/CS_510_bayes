Goldie Hawn had wonderful comedic gifts, and should have been in the movies more often. I still break out laughing when I think of her in one particular scene, and I can't even remember the name of the movie. I just remember her in it. Even though her physical beauty seems to finally be fading somewhat, she has managed to look incredible over the years, much younger that her age.
