I've spent 4 years flying all over the place for work and I must say that I now like American the best. They really do give you more legroom than on other airlines and it makes a huge difference. I normally order vegetarian meals and of all the airlines I've flown that serve food, American's veggie meals are the best. I had something on United that was undescribably bad. I don't even know what it was. On American it may be simple, but easily identifiable and always fresh.
