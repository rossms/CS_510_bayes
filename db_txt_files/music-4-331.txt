This album has a lot of energy and it's filled with good songs and catchy lyrics. End it on this, World go 'round, Happy now? and Don't speak have that somber note to it whilst Sixteen, You can do it, Hey you and Different people make you want to jump up and sing along. This is a great album but you get sick of the songs if you're overexposed.
