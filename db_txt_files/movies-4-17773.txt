This is a good movie because the killer is actually scary. It is repeated over and over that Michael is a psychopath who has no emotions. The audience sees this when Michael is eight and he kills his sister. There is no logic or reason for his actions, which makes him even scarier. The only flaw with this movie is that it is never explained why Michael never dies. He gets shot about ten times and falls out a two story window. He then walks away without a scratch on him. That's the only part that's stupid.
