This is one the great road bikes of all time. I've owned mine for 6 yrs and put 60000 miles on it. What makes the Valkyrie great is its overall versatility. It combines the all day comfort of a goldwing with the handling and power of anything in the sport touring class, the looks and cool engine to ride with the harley guys, and the reliability and finish of a Honda. And its a honest motorcycle. Its not trying to be a copy of someone else's motorcycle, everything you see is real steel, no false covers or fake scoops etc. A genuine future classic. It takes only one ride to understand!
