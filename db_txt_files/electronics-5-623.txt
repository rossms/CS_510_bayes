This phone is awesome! Once you have a Motorola Razr with all the functions on it (besides being thin), you'll never want another phone again. It has a awesome camera, color screen on both the outside and inside (which is plasma, of course), an chemically-etched keyboard, it's thin, bluetooth, what else could you ever want?
