Ok...Ill admit it...if there's an actess whom I like probably more for her looks then her acting she's the one. She's a decent actress whom I think will grow in her abilities if she chooses the right roles. In Charlies Angels when she flipped her hair and smiled...I was just as smitten as the guy in the movie. She does add a somewhat honest or innocent accent to some of the roles she plays.
