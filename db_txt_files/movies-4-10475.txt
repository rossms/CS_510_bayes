i bought this movie and watched it like 14 times in one week. Its great, the only downfall is that tom green isnt in it as much as i would have liked. But when he gets the chance to be on the screen he makes the part great and does an excelent job making things funny. Especially the salmon song!!! but anyways this is a great movie and go see it if you have a sense of humor
