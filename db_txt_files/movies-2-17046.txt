I was really unimpressed with this film. The acting performances by Kate Winslet, Kevin Spacey and Laura Linney were really the only thing I enjoyed about it. I really felt that the story was implaussable and the film just didn't deliver propely. Some of the issues raised were intriguing (innocent people falling victim to the death penalty), but it never really seemed to come together. I can't really explain but I was left with that irksome unsatisfied feeling at the end of the film
