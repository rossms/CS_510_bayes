Recorded in the late thirties, this Ellington album features the earliest of the modern bass players, Jimmy Blanton. Blanton's swinging bass lines propel this album with a deep swing. Ben Webster's tenor stylings culminate in his incredible solo's. Webster's tone was already developed into one of the most beautiful melodies in jazz.
