A unique, original, sexy, romantic and visually stunning musical. It is set in the 19th century(an 1899 cabaret club) but the songs are modern. Hearing songs such as Diamonds are a Girls Best Friend, Your Song, and Lady Marmalade in a musical setting is really cool. The cast is great with Nicole Kidman, Ewan McGregor, Jim Broadbent, John Leguizamo and Richard Roxburgh. Nicole Kidman has a beautiful singing voice, but the best is Ewan McGregor, boy can that man sing!
