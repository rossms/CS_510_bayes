i think that it is about time that microsoft came out with a game system. The X-BOX is the best consol yet, the graphics are great you don't need to buy a memory card (unless you want to) and not to mension all the games that are avilable, plus the games that are coming out, you also have the choice to save songs on the memory of the xbox and then listen to them while you are playing the game. And lets remember, xbox just came out, there are still a lot of things that microsoft has instore for the xbox owner. so don't waste your time buying a stupid gamecube or a PS2 buy an xbox.
