I thought that It was a good movie. I love Julia Stiles she is a extremly good actress. When I went to see this move I thought that it was mostly about dancing. Boy did I have the wrong idea. It dips more into the problems between black and white people. I would recommend it, but don't go in with the wrong idea like I did.
