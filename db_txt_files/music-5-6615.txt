This is by far Motley's best album to date. It has a little bit of everything on it. From songs cut from the cloth from their debut album, Too Fast For Love, right up to songs cut from the cloth of their Selt-Titled 94 album which featured John Corabi on vocals. This album is even more impressive when you consider the boys are 40 years old, and they still rock hard. This is the kind of album that makes you not only proud to be a Motley Crue fan, but a fan of Rock N Roll in general.
