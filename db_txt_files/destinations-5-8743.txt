Smooth mid-cut Copenhagen black (bourbon flavored) is the only Copenhagen product i buy. It's pretty stronge stuff in my opinon but very enjoyable, has a nice stronge odor when you open the tin. It taste like Whiskey "bourbon" and retains its flavour for quit awhile. I recommend this product to anyone, 5 stars!!
