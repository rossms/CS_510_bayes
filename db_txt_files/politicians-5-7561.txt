A model politician for the ages. True American rags to riches, strong convictions, truly deserving of every honor, not because he was assasinated as is so often the case with JFK, but because in his time in office he made tough decisions based not on public opinion, but on what was right. Freed the slaves, won a war, urged the completion of the capitol dome for national morale. Great American.
