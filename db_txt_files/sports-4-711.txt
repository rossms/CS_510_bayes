This guy is a superstar in the making. First of all, he can hit. People say that his average is inflated because he plays at Coors Field and that's true to some extent. If he didn't play there, he wouldn't be as close to .400. However, he is hitting about .360 on the road which would still be good enough to lead the NL. He is also a great athlete who played QB at Tennessee before Peyton Manning. Lastly, he is regarded as a great guy who plays hard and says the right things. Give him another couple of years and he will be mentioned among the best players in baseball (if he isn't there already).
