The graphics are great and everything but what's up with the 5 grand car wash.But I can not say that this is a bad game or anything.The simulation driving more than passed the gran turismo 1 driving and the cars are much better than 1 too but the options are scatterd everywhere. the game has more pros than cons. Gran turismo 1 taught me alot about cars and I didn't think there was much more to learn but as soon as my brother in law moved in and braught this game with him I played it and I know more than any of my friend know.I absloutly cant wait until Gran tusimo 3
