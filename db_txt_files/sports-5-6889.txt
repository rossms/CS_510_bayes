Touch the top of the backboard, military press 400 lbs., run 440 yds. in less than 50 seconds, score 60+ pts. in a game after the age of 30, Chamberlain had too much athletic talent not to succeed, if not at times dominate, if he played now. He had his faults -- shot freethrows poorly, lacked a dependable 10-12 ft. shot, didn't (esp. early on) best avail himself of teammates -- but a 25-28 yr. old Wilt Chamberlain, with the benefit of current training and coaching, could routinely score 20 pts. and grab 14 rebounds per game today.
