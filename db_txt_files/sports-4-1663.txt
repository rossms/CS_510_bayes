one of my fav baseball teams! I've just always loved them! i really like their stadium, too! i recommend to go there. i've probably been to 10 or more baseball stadiums and i only have a few favs and (for some reason!) this is one of my favorites. it might just be a few certain memories i have there, but i definetly also like being in illinois!
