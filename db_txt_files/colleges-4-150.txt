I have to disagree with mac1 opinion that is two years old. The University has revamped the program since and continues to make it better. I thought the program was very effective in allowing you to think outside the box unlike some traditional schools. The group projects allowed me to learn more from those that have experience. Everyone does not just get an A. In fact, we have had a couple Cs and Ds. I do not work for the University; I just enjoyed my experience with it.
