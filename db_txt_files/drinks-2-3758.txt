R C used to be my drink of choice when I was a young moron, but now that I'm an old moron I don't touch em. I always wondered why I would wake up the next day sick and be sick all day, and finally I figured it out...it was the coke tearing through my system. Now I stick to Rye and Gingers. They go down a lot easier, and they don't twist your plumbing into knots.
