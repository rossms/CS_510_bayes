Baldurs Gate: Dark Alliance is a great game. It has a fast pace, a great fighting system, and a feat system that works great in video games. One thing alone keeps this game from being unforgettable: The length. The game is short. If the game was even two hours longer, it would have made a lot of peoples days.
