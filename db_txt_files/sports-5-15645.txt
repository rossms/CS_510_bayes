I haven't given this guy his due in the past. He might be just shy of being amongst the best recieving tight ends like Gonzalez and Gates, but he's also amongst the best blocking tight ends in the league, I'd say barely behind other underrated guys like Jason Dunn and Kyle Brady. He might be the best mixture of blocking and recieving at tight end in the whole NFL.
