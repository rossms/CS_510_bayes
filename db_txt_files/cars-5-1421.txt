afropath said it best, unlike BIGBABY he gets the point! I have the S. The handeling is stunning. 163hp is plenty to keep most people entertained for a long time. And lest not forget the MINI has a tradition of aftermarket modification. When you grow bored with the 163hp you can easily step it up to 200, 225, or 250HP! That is WICKED FUN in a car of that size! All you dumb muscle car brutes who only look at size , power & machoism don't know what you're missing.
