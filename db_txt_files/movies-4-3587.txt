I have watched this movie dozens of times and it never ceases to amaze me. While the story is a bit confusing and slow, I truly believe that the experiences and emotions of the soldiers in the movie coincide with the same of the real-life soldiers of that era. Nick Nolte was excellent, as well as Ben Chaplin, John Cusack, Jim Caviezel, and Sean Penn. I believe it would have won a lot of those awards it was nominated for if Titanic hadn't come out the same year.
