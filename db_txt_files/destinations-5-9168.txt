Uluru and the Olgas (about 30 minutes away) were interesting but not overwhelming to look at. But once you are there and begin to learn the history behind the Rock and its significance to the indiginous people of Australia, you can't help but value the experience of actually being there. The conflict over whether or not to climb the Uluru, or to respect the Aborigines requests not to climb, was made easy once I began to understand the significance as well.
