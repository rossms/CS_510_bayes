Who else? What can I say? Montana is to NFL quarterbacks as Michael Jordan is to the NBA. The four time Super Bowl champion who gave the 49ers the moniker Team of the 80's is simply the best there is, the best there was, and the best there ever will be. Who can ever forget The Catch against those pesky Dallas Cowboys? Although it was sad to see him go to KC, I'm glad he retired as a 49er.
