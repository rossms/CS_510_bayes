Many pluses and minuses here.Don't even bother if you are disturbed by crowds! NYC has a lot to offer culturally:museums,plays,art galleries by the ton.Any kind of food in the world can be found here,usually within a few blocks.Cheap transportation is available if you can figure out the maze of subways.However,it is egregiously expensive to entertain yourself or shop here.You may not get mugged,but the results are the same when you get home with your empty wallet.
