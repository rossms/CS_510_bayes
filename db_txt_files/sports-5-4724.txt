Gene Keady is what every coach should be. He can't get the blue chips in a state with IU, Notre Dame, and being that close to other Big 10 rivals, but he makes more out of less than any other coach in the NCAA. Any coach in any division in any kind of basketball will tell you the same, he is a great, great, great coach.
