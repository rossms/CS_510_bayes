Gummie Bears are a classic. They are really good, although don't go looking for an overly sweet candy in these little things. Also, I think the soft, almost clear ones are the only ones worth your time. The tough ones are what give Bears a bad rep, they truly are disgusting. However, once you find the right brand, they're a delight. The pineapple (clear) and the cherry (red) ones are by far superior to the other colours...and every package always lacks pineapple!!!
