It was the best of the films released in the newer triology. Explained everything well and helped tie up any loose ends from the first trilogy. Hayden Christensen was wooden as ever and Natalie Portman didn't have a whole lot to do but sit around the house and get bigger and more pregnant. Ewan McGregor was awesome, as always. Best thing about the movie was the fact there was no dialogue in the last 5 minutes, just scenes done in silence that basically wrapped up everything and showed how the twins were separated. etc. Can't beat the last shot of the Tattooine sunset on the Lars family farm!
