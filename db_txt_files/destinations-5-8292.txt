I am shocked that Disneyland is not rated higher on the list. How could you ever not give Disneyland a 5? That is beyond me. I love Disneyland. I know it is for kids. I wouldn't go there for my wedding or anything but it is a really fun place. It is filled with great rides, great restaurants, yes, there are long lines, and it is really crowded but that goes to show how fun it is. There is a creativeness there that no other place can capture.
