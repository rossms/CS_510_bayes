A great man. He could have been king and turned this country into a completely different form from what it was. Thank God that our current presidents don't have his power, they certainly don't have his strong ethics. He believed that the government should interfer with the common people as little as possible. He could have taken this country and easily become a dictator. He chose to step aside after 2 terms-great. A great precident for the men who followed him. Others had more terms but it was always understood that it wasn't to become a permanent post for any man. (or maybe someday woman).
