Within this tormented, sad, but ultimately brilliant album are lyrics that, when looked at in hindsight, can be seen to be a cry for help from a man who, soon after the albums release, took his life. This gives these songs a gravity that is rarely seen in any music. Check out, I Think I'm Dumb and All Apologies for some of the telling lyrics.
