Denver is a remarkably forward looking city. The mountains in the distance are beautiful, the skyline of Denver is pretty, and bike trails criss-cross the city. Even in winter, the sun is shining. The traffic can be a little severe - Denver wasn't built for the people coming into the city - but the light rail should help relieve some of those problems. It's got a great sports scene, and the area around Coors Field is exploding with lofts and condominiums. It doesn't have the culture of a New York or Chicago - yet. But give it a little time. This is a city on the rise.
