An interesting way of capturing what it was like to see a play when Shakespeare was writing. It was uncomfortable at times having to stand to watch the play, and others seemed to be uncomfortable as well. I would much rather prefer to watch a performance in a more comfortable chair than having to lean against other people in front of a stage. However, it was worth the visit to see the recreation of Shakespeare's Globe.
