I dig this. I've always been a fan of tropical-flavored drinks, and mixing Sprite with tropical flavors was a good idea and Coke pulled it off well. It reminds me a bit of a tropical soda I tried in Europe, only with some Sprite flavor mixed in. A very refreshing drink, I like it better than regular Sprite and the bottles look cool too!
