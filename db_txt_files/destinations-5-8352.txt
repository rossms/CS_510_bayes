The only place in LA with a pulse. You see all kinds here. It almost feels as if you're in a real city. Yes, the beach is dirty. Go somewhere else for a dip in the water. Feel a kinship and community with other human beings within the PLASTIC that is LA. No surprize that the locals hate it. They'd feel safer trapped inside their metal boxes.
