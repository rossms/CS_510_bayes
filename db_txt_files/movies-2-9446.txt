This is one of the most boring films I've seen in a long time, except A Very Long Engagement. The good part never came. There are a few funny, but not hilarious momments, but by and large nothing's happening -- which I guess is the point: these 2 middle-aged guys are at a crossroads, and one of them is suffering from serious inertia, nothing going on, blah, blah, blah. The other's getting married and has to get some screwing out of his system first. That's the whole movie. Oh yeah, one metaphor: wine -- big deal, runs through the whole thing.
