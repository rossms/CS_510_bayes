This is my second favorite cheese, and NOT the individual wrapped stuff, that tastes like plastic, I can't see why anyone would by that crap, but the Kraft type in the little bricks, that you peel a couple slices off to melt on your hamburger, just heavenly. I think a couple slices in between french bread, with tomatoes, mayo and lettuce is a heavenly sandwich! BUT, that said, the Kraft American cheese is getting way to pricey for my income, so I have not purchased it for a while.
