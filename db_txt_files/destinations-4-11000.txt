Darien Lake is enough to satisfy your fix for amusement park fun, but if you need to travel you are better off going to Hershey in PA or a Great Adventure. We went there for a senior day trip in High School..fun rides, not enough roller coasters for me though. The water rides were a blast and the lines weren't too long since it was Senior Day ..(High School seniors that is)..This is your average amusement park..they do have some fairly decent concerts in the summer.
