It's at #119? Why? UH is great if you don't care about school spirit. If you do, you won't be happy. Most students commute in from home, and many have jobs and families. So if you want to paint yourself funny colors and run around the quad drunk, don't come. If you want a reasonably priced yet _excellent_ education, come. It's academically just as good as the other state universities, but it gets less funding because it's "just a city college." Its graduate creative writing program ranks #2 in the country.
