I, too, think this is a very good program. With it, I can keep track of all my expenses, including exactly what the expenditure was for. I'm running a Mac version, which still runs under OS-9 but am having problems with occasional database corruption, which is frustrating. No other software I've seen allows for the annotation that I want. I'd love a way to solve the problem and maybe a version that would run under either Mac OS-X or Windows XP. Please?
