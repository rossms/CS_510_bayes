I can't remember what possessed me to rent this movie, at the time I thought it was a throw away star vehicle for the (then) up and coming Mark Walberg and Jennifer Aniston. But I was taken off guard by it. The story and the feel of it seemed like a pretty authentic ride through the less than halcyon era of the 80's hair metal rock and roll life. It's kind of like a bummer companion to idealistic "Almost Famous", in the same way that the film "Gimme Shelter" showed the seamy underbelly of the Love and Flower Generation that we saw in "Woodstock".
