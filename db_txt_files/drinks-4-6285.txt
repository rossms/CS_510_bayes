Diet Rite has been a great alternative to diet drinks that contain Nutrasweet and other artificial sweetners. I haven't experienced any craving of carbs from drinking this soda. I like the white grape and tangerine/orange the best. Having moved back to Colorado-I have had a very hard time finding any of these flavors and have been drinking only the cola version. Not my favorite but it will do until stores starts carrying more variety.
