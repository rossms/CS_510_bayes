The man is a legend and deserves to be just that! Probably one of the greatest coaches of all time, it was a sad day for all Carolina fans when that man walked off the court. He made Carolina the basketball powerhouse they are today! No one can deny that... now, i wonder if he could do the same thing for the football team?
