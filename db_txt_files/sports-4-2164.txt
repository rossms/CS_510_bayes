Great team in the 70's, and won the whole thing in '40 and '90 as well. A great town for baseball: until the economics of the game changed some years back. The 70's team was great, but kind of a cold, efficient, methodical bunch: frankly not the most colorful team. I'm taking nothing away from how remarkable they were, but I like teams with lots of characters, like the A's or Red Sox had in that period. Bill Lee, the screwball lefty said: "Jack Webb should be their manager." Lately, they've become a rather boring team.
