Surprisingly, I liked this movie. It was a pretty good romantic comedy. Drew Barrymore was hysterical as the nerdy Josie. This film was also sort of motivational and inspirational in a sense, as it is a film that many can relate to. Indeed, the lesson of this story is perhaps that it doesn't really matter what you are like in high school- its what you do afterwards that counts! David Arquette was pretty good in this movie, as was Michael Vartan. Molly Shannon really added something with her Sex Education scene. Overall, a good movie.
