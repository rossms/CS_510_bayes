Probably the greatest president. Funny.. Lincoln and FDR, the two most commons presidents historians pick as the greatest, are the two of the people in history who were probably the most dictorial. Anyway, he was the president during 2 of the 3 most challenging times in our nation's short history, and he led us through them. Only the ignorant can say FDR, thanks for nothing..
