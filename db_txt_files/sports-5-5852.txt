Before this season, Redick was a one-dimensional player who could really shoot. It's clear he's worked on his game, becoming more of a scorer, being able to create his shot and make it. He doesnt have a ton of talent, but is a true BBall player. He can score from pretty much anywhere on the court and in any situation. He's made himself into a solid pro prospect.
