This is not the same orange Fanta that I had in Europe. That stuff was great, a lighter and just plain better taste than any orange soda sold in the US, and it was even a different shade of orange (more like the color of orange juice). But the Fanta sold here just tastes like typical orange soda, they're just selling Minute Maid under a different name. It's not bad but it's not the Fanta I miss from Europe! Coca-Cola, please bring us the real Fanta Orange. And bring the lemon and lime flavors here while you're at it! Then maybe i'll wanta Fanta!
