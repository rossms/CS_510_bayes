This is a great song! And I love the video! Gwen rules! And just for clarification, in the video Moby was trying to be someone he is not! He was trying to be that cool, tough, popular guy, that everyone wants to be. So just incase, I wanted to make sure none of you got the wrong impression. Moby is not stuck up and his music rules, and I absolutely love this video!
