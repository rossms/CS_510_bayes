Sweet game. That's all that really needs to be said. But if you're one of those people that need more information than that, I'm here for you, too. Cel shading was a good decision by Nintendo. It really helps this game. There's so much expression and tiny details. Rising dust clouds even look awesome in this game. The boss fights are just spectacular. All of the wonderful music contributes to the environment. The story is another grade-A production. Just great.
