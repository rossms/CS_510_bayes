One thing that surprised me was how tastefully set out and done the area was. It isn't a case of them walking all over the place being lewd. Of course I found it a bit weird walking past 'shop' windows seeing girls in their underwear there, but considering I'm used to seeing the female form (being a girl myself) and prositution is one of the oldest trades, I didn't find it overwhelming. The area itself is very pretty, and the canal bridges are lit up in red so you know where you are.
