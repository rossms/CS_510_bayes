Now THIS is a good soundtrack. My favorite soundtracks of the 60's were this, the eerie music in the original Planet of the Apes, and Ennio Morricone's compositions in the" Spaghetti Western" flicks, especially "The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly" and the stunning guitar work in "Once Upon A Time in the West."
