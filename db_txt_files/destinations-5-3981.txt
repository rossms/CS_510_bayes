I had a lot of fun in Orlando, and I didn't even go to Walt Disney World. Dan Marino's Town Tavern was a blast, and the Mall at Millennia is arguably the best shopping mall I've ever been to. There are plenty of elaborate mini-golf courses there too. Also, check out the elevated go-kart track on International Drive, as well as the world's largest McDonald's. On the downside, there are too many damn toll roads in the area. Overall, though, I had a lot of fun there.
