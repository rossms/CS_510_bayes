I thought we where rating him as a baseball player! If he did or didnt bet on baseball that is not imortant what kind of player he was on the field is he was a hell of a hitter and played with alot heart that is what this is based on. We put the best ball players in the Hall of Fame I would say he should be there regardless. So what if he did bet on baseball did he make his team lose on purpose I mean please. I love seeing those one stars you guys must have just started watching baseball god knows you havent been a fan of it for very long to be that stupid
