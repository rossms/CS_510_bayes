We bougt a Ford Ranger Edge 2001 only 8 months ago and continuously having problems with it. It has a 3-inch lift and quite a looker, but otherwise I am extremely disappointed. From the beginning it loses anywhere from 1 qt.-4 qts. of oil about every two weeks (burning). The 4-wheel drive does not engage properly, the wipers do not work, the window doesn't go down smoothly, and just last night the airbag light is now on!! We won't discuss the cramped space! Pretty to look at, but not practical and continuously needing work.
