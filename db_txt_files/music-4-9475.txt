So THIS is why everyone says Mr. Jackson is so good. The album is genuinely quality music. A friend burned it for me. Wanna Be Startin' Somethin', Human Nature, and Billie Jean are all favourites of mine. Sure, it gets corny at times, but I like it. Good instrumentation, classic voice, it's funky, it's fun.
