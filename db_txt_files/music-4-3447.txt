OK,I agree it's kind of lame to include greatest hits collections on this list- and personally,I like the more obscure material on the actual albums...however,this is an awesome collection-and if you are someone who just wants to have all the great Stones songs you heard on the radio up till it's release,this is the one to buy.I especially like the live version of Midnight Rambler.
