Bill is the first honest, educated, as well as experienced politician to run for President in a long time. He has the intelligence of Senator Moynihan and Byrd---while also being able to relate to the common voter...I'm proud I was able to volunteer on his campaign in New Hampshire...it will be one of the most rememberable moments as a college student.
