There is no where else on earth like Michigan. I've been to many ocean beaches - including Cape Hatteras National Seashore, North Carolina, Carmel, California, etc...Michigan tops them all. You never know what color the great lakes will be - I've seen them turquoise blue to aqua green to deep blue to clear. Miles and miles of sanddunes, heck, if you want a day of sun you can pick your own dune...beautiful huge pine trees, unrivaled camping, hunting and fishing...nothing else like it in the world. The farther north you go, the more beautiful it is. Michigan is truly a magical world.
