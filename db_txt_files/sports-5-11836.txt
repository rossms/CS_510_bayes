Loved his show where he played the sherrif of a small southern town, ttying to raise his little boy, who left when he became a teen-ager and moved in with the Cunninghams in Milwaukee after the death of their first son, Chuck. After that show was cancelled, he went on to explore space and eventually landed a job as a sdouthern laywer. I guess all those years as a cop gave him a unique iinsight into the criminal mind. Umm, Sorry, thought this item was baout ANDY Griffin! (Yeah, I know it's GRIFFITH, but the joke works better this way!)
