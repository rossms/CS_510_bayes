4 1/2 stars.This compelling,insightful drama concerning a repressed homosexual who joins the Italian fascist movement and is then expected to assassinate his former professor, is rightly regarded by many critics as director Bertolucci's best film.While Trintignant is utterly convincing in the lead role,the cinematography by the great Vittorio Storaro(Apocalypse Now,The Last Emperor)is ravishing,sensual and quite extraordinary.
