They sure don't make Republicans like Abe Lincoln any more, do they?! The first Republican president was a champion of human rights and honesty; now we have a Republican pseudo-president who stole his way into White House and gutted funding for removing arsenic in drinking water. If Lincoln were alive today, he'd be a Democrat.
