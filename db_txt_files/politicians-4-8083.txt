Like Gerald Ford, Ike is often overlooked/under-appreciated because he didn't blow his own horn (a la Bill Look at me! Clinton). He gave us the interstate highway system, which virtually all Americans use on a regular basis, played a strong hand against the Red Menace, and he apparently only had one mistress, instead of dozens, again a la Bill Dirty Rotten Liar Clinton. If he'd had no affairs and had supported civil rights more strongly, he'd be a five-star president.
