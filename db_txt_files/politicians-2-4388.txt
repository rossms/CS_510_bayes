I don't really have much of an opinion of Condi Rice, as she has never (?) in my memory expressed a view different than Bush's. She has been rewarded for this loyalty, but it still doesn't help me figuring out if she has ideas of her own. However edt4, I'm not sure what her race has to do with it. No reason that I'm aware of that Blacks can't be big government and unilateral in their policy thinking.
