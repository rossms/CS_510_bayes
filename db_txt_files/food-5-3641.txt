While I really love Thin Mints and a couple of other kinds of GS Cookies, I think they are highly overpriced. It's a shame too that the Girl Scouts get so little profit for all their hard work selling the cookies! One of my granddaughters sold over 250 boxes and another one sold 65 (I bought my fair share!) and I think their troops should get a better return on all their work.
