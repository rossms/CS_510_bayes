Andrew Johnson did a decent job of getting our country back on the road to recovery after the Civil War through Reconstruction. Lincoln could have never done it because he was an extremely divisive person, especially in the South. Johnson was a Tennessean whom the South could at least respect. He brought the nation together and that is enough to give him a good rating.
