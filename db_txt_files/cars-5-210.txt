I have a sportsman 500 H.O. and it definetly will out preform all my buddies. Its got the acceleration and the top speed on all of them. After my friends Honda there is still no comparison to the comfort and smooth ride the all round idependent suspension has to offer. I am proud to be and owner of a polaris.
