It's overpriced, but Cask 23 is one of the finest California Cabs you can buy. There is nothing subtle about it. The full body, and smooth but active tannins envelope you from start to finish. Be sure to let your glass breathe, the nose and the bouquet will grow on you. As the evening unfolds, so will the wine.
