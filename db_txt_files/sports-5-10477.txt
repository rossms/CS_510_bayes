One of the greatest coaches of all time and a great guy. Has been on the hot seat for giving players second chances but he really cares about the player and wants to see them succeed. Does a lot for the community and is a caring man. He built the Florida State program from scrach and has maintained it as on of the most successful over the past couple of decades.
