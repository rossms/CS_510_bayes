She hasn't done anything really challenging, so you can't really tell that she's a great actress. But check out those beautiful expressions she has. The only good thing about the movie Se7en was the restaurant scene with Morgan Freeman where she totally blew him out of the water. Bounce wasn't terribly good, but she did a good job. She's pretty. She's intelligent. Just give her a few more years.
