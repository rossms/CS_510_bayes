Toothpick! Not a good look. If she paid as much attention to the rest of her figure as she does to her lips she might be ok. She used to look so pretty when she was in Twin Peaks (?yeah) - dating Jack Nicholson has a lot to answer for. I think she has some serious distortion of reality issues to deal with. She always seems so snitty and venting her spleen at everyone and seems quite proud of her petulant reputation. Just admit you need some help Lara and leave your lips alone.
