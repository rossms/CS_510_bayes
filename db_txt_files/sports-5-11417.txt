Forget all the 'bama bluster sour grapes... the guy knows how to coach. He has been able to make things happen in weak programs and turn them around. I will be watching A M with interest this year to see what shapes up, and I will be even more interested to see the program evolve in the seasons following this one. Big 12 is getting more and more interesting... I'll have to get TiVO before it all begins.
