I would love to have more name recognition with my degree. I think this program is great, The diamond in the rough. JIU is undiscovered to many people who go to the largest "big mouth" on campus(UoP). With a little research, you can get a great university online! In fact they were the first fully online program that achieved the level of Regional Accreditation. What a great experience, I am in my 3rd class in the MBA program and I am really liking that I do not have to be logged in at any specific time.
