Never been but I hear it's a great city to live, as far as laid back cities goes. Apparently the city government has put out bicycles in the street for people to use them at their convenience. Talk about a revolutionary concept; also advantageous and ecofriendly. This also speaks highly about the trustworthiness of the inhabitants.
