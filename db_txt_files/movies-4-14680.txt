Well this movie was interesting. I tell ya people shouldn't even worry about being super rich or super rich people, as there seems to be quite a price to pay to live in high society. Gillian Anderson gave a wonderful performance, as did Dan Akroyd. It was done like a theatric play, with straight drama, no background score or hardly any scenic wide shots. You have to be in the right mood for this tragic drama, but if you are than it is pretty fulfilling.
