This cereal scared the hell out of me when I was 10 (because of the enormously crunchy sound it makes) but now that I'm 30, I can really respect it. It's got a great taste. If people are getting hurt chewing Grape Nuts and think that it's too harsh to chew on, they should stop whining and floss daily.
