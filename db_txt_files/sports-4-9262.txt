Stack has to step it up this year with the departure of Grant Hill and he's putting forth the effort. But his horrible fg% is hurting more than it is helping. I also question whether the guy is going to be durable enough for his team to rely on. He's always been injury prone and has numerous nagging injuries even when he is healthy enough to play. No player in the NBA sacrifices his body more than Stack which is why he is consitently among the league leaders in free throws, but his agressiveness also leads to his constant injuries.
