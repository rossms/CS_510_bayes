Great tasting Austrailian style larger. More bold tasting than it's American counterparts, and always refreshing. It reminds me of the episode of the Simpsons when the Family went to Austraila. MArge tried to order COFFEE but the waiter was unable to say coffee, always saying Beer! Brilliant Advertising campaign, too. It's Austrailian for beer, Mate!
