Sam Cassell cracks me up. More than any other player on the floor, Sam always seem to be having fun. He's always smiling, joking around with his teammates, the opponents, the refs - the guy looks like he would be a trip to hang out with. Don't be fooled, however. The man is a cold blooded killer on the basketball court, and has mad skills. His crossover is sick and he can break almost anybody down off of the dribble. His ability to score makes him a dangerous passer as well - as a Sixer fan, I will be terrified of Mr. Cassell come playoff time.
