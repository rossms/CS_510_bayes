This is a great game. We recently started a game at school but stopped because of GCSE's. I'm not a geek and am 1 of the sportiest in my school but love this game because its great to see ur friends/allys face when u attack them. Its great to be england working with russia or germany and i have won many games as turkey. Especially when allied with either russia or austria. But you're screwed if russia and austria gang up on u. LOL.
