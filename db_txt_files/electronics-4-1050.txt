This is a real good phone. I only looked at it and already its a good choice for those of yall who want a camera phone. The color resolution is real good and has alot of camera options. Cingular is offering this phone for online for only 59.99(with a 2-year contract) I would put down this offer for a camera phone for such and affordable price. Go for it.
