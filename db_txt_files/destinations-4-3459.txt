I live half hour north of beantown and i thin it is a cool place to hang out. There is a lot of history here, and since it's so multicultural you get a unique vibe from going here. faneiul hall is a great place to grab a bite and shop, and catching a free movie at the hatshell on summer night is really fun. Nothing beats a long relaxing walk in the oublic gardens, as does unwinding on the swan boats on the common. Theres something for everyone in boston. The only downside is that the architecture here is a little lacking, and not very colorful.
