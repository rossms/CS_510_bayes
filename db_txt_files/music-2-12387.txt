This album was disappointing. Even though Brandy's voice can be very inviting at times, that still doesn't save Full Moon. The music is too electronic. The only real standout is Full Moon (title track), my favorite. She wants too have a Timbaland sound at times on this album but she falls way short. At least, she'll have the real thing on her next album. Suggestions: Brandy (1994)- soulful vocals, decent R B production
