Good budget tequila, I myself prefer a higher end of booze, but for the money this stuff isn't bad at all I've had it a few times. I like it, but if I was buying a Tequila I would have to go with the 1800 black label cuervo, which cost around $44 a 5th, another good choice would be some Don Julio for roughly $39 a 5th.
