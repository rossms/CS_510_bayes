Best quarterback in the NFL; sorry Peyton. This guy has more poise than anybody I've ever seen. He makes good decisions, is very accurate, and has an underrated deepball. His toughness is also underrated; he'll stand in the pocket until the very last second and takes some nasty hits. Very underrated.
