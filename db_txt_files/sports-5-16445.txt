Great as Tulane QB who's career has been stunted by a bad coach ( Spurrier ) and one who never really believed in him ( Joe Gibbs). The sooner he leaves DC the better. There are half a dozen teams he could start for : Miami , Arizona , Detroit, Cleveland , NY Jets , Chicago, Buffalo. He's tough with a strong arm. Put him with a coach, Off. Coodinator , who can work with his strengths and he'll thrive.
