Frankfurt, in my experience,is generally well-organized, but it moves people like cattle. Security has always been tight, but last September I went through and it was exceptionally tough - better than at US airports. The downside is that once we got into a waiting area, they would not let people out even to go to the rest room. Waiting areas tended to be a bit smokefilled.
