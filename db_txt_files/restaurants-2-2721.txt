A friend of mine always referred to Mcdonalds' sandwiches as gut busters ...he said when you were too backed up... eat a Big Mac and your problems would soon be gone. I do eat there every so often and always mad at myself afterwards for doing so...I think the food is discusting and the only thing more discusting is to eat at a DIRTY Mcdonalds...
