 I have flown over Utah and spent time in the SLC airport it looks nice and there appears to be a culture clash between the established mormon population and the heretic masses moving in from everywhere. Based on my research you can have fun in Utah if you seek it out. There are plenty of repressed frustrated Utah Women ready to rebel against their silly Mormon faith and upbringing.
