Did ya get my Cheez Whiz boy? Another cult classic that was panned by critics and largely ignored by audiences when it came out. The popularity of the movie has grown somewhat with time, but it's still an aquired taste. It's a bit sloppy, but the music and the silliness make up for that with me. If you haven't seen it, settle in with some dry white toast, four whole fried chickens, and a Coke and take it in some time.
