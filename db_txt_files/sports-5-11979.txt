Lawrence Taylor was largely responsible for both bringing North Carolina to national prominence in football during the early 1980's as well redefining the position of linebacker (though he usually played defensive end in college). Fast, aggressive and instinctive, Taylor deserves to be near the top of this list of greatest all-time college football players.
