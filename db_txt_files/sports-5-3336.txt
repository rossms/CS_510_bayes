Probably the best outfield arm I ever saw, with the possible exceptions of Evans, Valentine and Parker. A very good hitter, on a small market team who didn't get much attention until the 1971 Series, when he played like a man possessed in leading the Pirates to victory over a great Oriole team. His early death certainly has added to his lustre, but 3000 hits is no small achievement. He's up in the top levels of the game's great players.
