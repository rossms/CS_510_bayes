Never actually understood all the hype surrounding this restaurant. I have been to a few Hard Rock Cafe's (Cleveland, Chicago, Toronto, Niagara Falls, and San Francisco), and really, I never found the food tha good at any of the locations I have been to. The charge a lot of money for the rather mediocre food, and after you have seen 3 or 4 of these location, the luster wears off, and you see that it is just a normal restaurant that plays a lot of Madonna.
