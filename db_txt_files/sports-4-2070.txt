Any team with the one-two punch of Johnson and Schilling deserves to win a lot. I was VERY happy to see them take down the Yankees in '01, and do it with class and style. It's a few months late, I know, but congrats D'Backs! If you meet the Yanks in the October Classic in '02, how about a repeat performance?
