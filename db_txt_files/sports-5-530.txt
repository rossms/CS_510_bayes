derek jeter is an excellent short stop that even if he did play for a crappy team like the Atlanta Braves he stll would of gotten the Golden Glove and if he is just plain overated why is the New York Yankees paying him US$19.01 million a season and u don.'t just get that fro being overated and alex rodriguez is not a better shortstop he is a better 3rd basemen. i think derek jeter is a excellent role model for us young males i am 14 and i hope to play for the yankees i have already played for N.S.W twice.
