Not the greatest catcher of all-time. Josh Gibson Mickey Cochran were better before him and Ivan Rodriquez is better now. Catchers are getting good again offensively(Mike Piazza, Pudge, Javy Lopez, Jason Kendall). Carlton Fisk even gave Bench a run for his money in the 70's. Bench was probably second-best in history defensively, behind IR. Endurance keeps him down a bit. He was durable during his career, it just died early.
