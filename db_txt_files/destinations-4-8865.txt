I prefer Levi Garrett to Redman. Levi Garret has a superior texture, which keeps it from turning to a mess in your mouth. You can truly CHEW it. The flavor, while still a bit too sweet for my taste, is not as sickly-sweet as Redman, and is a bit saltier than Redman. Also, Levi Garret has a more pronounced tobacco flavor, and does not start to taste stale and paper-like after a few minutes, as Redman does. Im still looking to find a chew that is only slightly sweet. In the meantime, I will chew Levi Garrett.
