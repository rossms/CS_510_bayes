Major disappointment. It is evident that Powell knew fairly early into the Bush administration just how much of an idiot he was working for. He nevertheless kept repeating the mantra "I serve at the pleasure of the President" Horse manure! He serves the PEOPLE, and if he knew Bush was an idiot, he should have noisily resigned and made it clear why!
