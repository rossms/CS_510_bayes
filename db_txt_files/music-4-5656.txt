This CD will get your adrenaline going if nothing else. From Paradise City, to Mr. Brownstone, to Sweet Child o Mine, this album really kicks ass. It brings back fond memories of drunken college rowdiness / agression... I'm not sure if i could listen to it now at age 31 (hence the 4 rating), but Appetite for Destruction was definitely a heavy hitter in its day.
