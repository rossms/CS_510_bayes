Alan Keyes is one of the most articulate and passionate people on this earth. My only advice to him would be to be more leary of sounding too angry too often. His message is intellectually and morally sound, but his genuine enthusiasm for his point is often mistaken by the feeling that we are being lectured at, instead of being given, and allowed to absorb, his words of wisdom.
