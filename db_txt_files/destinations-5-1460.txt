France is an absolutely wonderful country. Paris is a must as its seeped in history and has absolutely gorgeous buildings and there's loads to do. And for all the people who have rated this country badly. You narrowminded, conceited b*****ds. When people slag America off, you are up in arms about it - what gives you the right to do that to another country? Have you actually been there to judge? If you haven't, then actually go there and open up your minds and then you will see that there is a lot of great things in France.
