This is the first and only car that I have begun to work with. I must say, it's very versitle. It may be no 9-second drag car, but with care and great consideration, it is a formidable road race/autocross car. It has taken me from point A to point B, it's been very reliable, and it's fun to drive. It may not be the fastest car on the road, but, by golly, it's fun. If a person were to ask a Celica-owner how he/she feels about his/her Celica, I'm sure the response would be, I love my Celica.
