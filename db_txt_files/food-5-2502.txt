The Butterfinger is a truly decadent treat. The flaky, buttery layers meld with the chocolate coating to produce a heavenly combination of peanut butter and chocolate. Since Butterfingers are so rich, I prefer to buy Butterfinger B.B.'s, small nuggets of the real thing that can be eaten like M M's. Delicious!
