Juvenile at times, but still quite enjoyable. Arguably the best of the full-length computer animated films so far. The graphics and voices were really well-done. I sort of get tired of Eddie Murphy always playing that funny tag-along character. Still, a very good movie with a good message and a good arsenal of hilarious parts. Really really.
