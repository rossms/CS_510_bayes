this vid needs a face lift. I really don't care for the song that much, it has a kinda good arrangement but it could be better and alot more clubby. It really don't belong in a club just yet, Could be longer and more elaborate of an arrangement. I don't really like nsyncs new style and they did better with 'no strings attached ... needs some work....
