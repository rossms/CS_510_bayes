I feel that Larry is the most self-motivated basketball player that ever suited up in a Celtics uniform. When he entered the NBA, he was one of the main players to resurrect the league from all time mediocrity. Larry epitomises a player that worked the hardest to be the best he could ever be at what he does the best-to play NBA basketball.
