Have been driving the Escape for 2 years now. Ride and overall comfort are above average. It is quieter inside than my wifes Chrysler. Can haul plenty and the V-6 seems unphased. There is plenty of jump there when you need to punch the gas. My only complaint is the gas mileage. Much of my driving is around town and I average only 13-14 mpg. Should be better.
