He's quite a scary individual. I'm speaking as someone from outside the US. He comes across as very arogant and self-rightous.Its scary to think what country he may set his sights on next. This pre-emptive strike thing will not do the US any favours in the long run. He seems to think that he's the man and nobody should disagree with him. He may be intelligent and straight speaking, but he has no charisma. Even the Prime Minister of Spain, one of Americas closest allies in the war said that he'd appreciate less of Donald Rumsfeld and more of Colin Powell.
