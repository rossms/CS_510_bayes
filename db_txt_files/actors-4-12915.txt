I actually like her in LOTR. I think she's done a great job in these films and has proved to have good screen presence. Her father is a scumbag (singer for Aerosmith Steven Tyler), but Liv seems to be creating a separate image for herself. Many people seem to dislike Liv using the usual nepotism claims against her, but it's absurd.
