As teen high school movies go, this is one of the better ones. quite a few now famous actors were in this. Sean Penn is good as the always high Spicoli, I especially like his scenes with Ray Walston as his stern social studies teacher. It takes place in the early 1980s. has a pretty good soundtrack too. A good screenplay written by Cameron Crowe.
