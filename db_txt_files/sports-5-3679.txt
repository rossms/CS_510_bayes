What can you say about a throwback type of player like Cal Ripken? I wish all players were like him. Today it's not about the team, it's about the individual. Baseball is a team sport, not an individual one. Cal's streak and the Sosa-Mcguire race did more for baseball than anything else in the past decade. Thanks Cal for the memories. Camden Yards is the best Stadium in the U.S.!!!!
