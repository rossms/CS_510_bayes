Munson -- Duquette is slowly killing the franchise by signing Pedro and Manny Ramirez? Not to mention, trades like Lowe and Varitek for Slocumb? I know hating the Sox is a Yankee fan pastime, but speak smart baseball if you know what you are talking about. No big name free agents want to come to Boston to play sure, of course except for baseball's leading RBI man.
