How can this film be rated so high on a list of horror flicks?? It was by far one of the cheesiest scary movies that was released recently. Although it's not unbearable to watch, it is more funny than scary cuz it's so damn ridiculous! The only decent scene was when that chick stepped in front of the bus.
