I transferred to BSU from Purdue. It is a very nice school that doesn't get a lot of credit in or out of Indiana. It isn't the party school that people think it is. If you're interested in nursing, teaching, architecture, communications, or music, Ball State is one of the best choices out there. Reasonably priced (especially compared to schools in bigger conferences).
