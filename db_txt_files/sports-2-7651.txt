One of the 3 most grossly overrated players of all-time. He is silent without Michael. As Ellajedlicka stated, took himself out of a key game for selfish reasons only to have it backfire when the Bulls won the game on Kukoc's 3-pointer at the buzzer. Also has a reputation as a tightwad when out on the town. Referred to as no tippin' Pippen for lack of gratuity.
