Upon first observation, it may seem like the Foo Fighters are a silly bunch of clowns(riding on the success of Nirvana)who don't take themselves seriously. But if you listen to their songs it is evident that Dave Grohl feels the most comfortable being serious and poignant in the context of a song. This makes the songs all the more sweet and honest. While none of the compostitions are stellar, it is absolutely 100% sincere.
