Oreos are a staple, they're just awesome. Regular or double stuffed rocks. I tried the uh-ohs and they're pretty good as well but I was majorly dissapointed with the peanut butter oreo. I love pb but these just didnt taste right. Last christmas they sold mini peppermint oreos that tasted heavenly but unfortunately I can't seem to find them anywhere anymore, maybe the mint oreo tastes similar though.
