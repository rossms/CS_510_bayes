Rome has some of the most amazing sights in the world. From the Coliseum to St. Peter's, it is truly amazing to actually see the many sites that you've heard about. Unfortunately, it is quite dirty with a lot of polution. There is also a serious problem with gypsies. My friend and I saw a group of gypsy kids (using pieces of cardboard to distract their targets) pickpocket a young woman and attempt to do the same to many others.
