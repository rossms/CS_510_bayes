A good coach and a real gentleman...that's why he doesn't belong at OU, the home of some of the most spoiled, rude, and obnoxious fans in all of football. This doesn't apply to every fan, of course. I know a few good ones. But the overwhelming majority I've known are an insult to sportsmanship and good manners.
