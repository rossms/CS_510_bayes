We went to see this one on the request of my eight year old who has always loved the Rug Rats. She loved it and wants to buy a copy of it when it comes to DVD. I ve sat through a lot of movies with her, but this one was one of those kid only types of films. They seem to really love it, I thought it ran on forever. I m going to give it a four since the kids are the audience the film is geared to and they seem to enjoy it.
