I always thought Kobe was a great athlete. I think it is sad that anyone would hate him because of his alleged rape BEFORE he was convicted for it. I think everyone should give him a chance to come out of court guilty or not guilty. Hopefully the truth will come out in the end. If he is guilty of rape, then yes I will have to say he is a piece of crap and I will feel very violated for looking up to him. But if he is found not guilty, then I will have the same respect for him I always had.
