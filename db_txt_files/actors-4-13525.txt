Why are people berating Hudson for marrying Chris Robinson? And why is it so important that she is the daughter of Goldie Hawn? She has used the name 'Hudson' to establish herself as an actress in her own right! As for the thing about Britney, well let's just say I totally agree with Kate on that. Never has a more talentless hack been as overexposed as Britney. But I digress- this is Kate's page! So, anyway, I think people should take a second glance at this actress because she comes across as a woman with potential to accomplish so much more than she already has!
