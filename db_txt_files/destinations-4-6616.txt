i lived in arkansas for half of my life and some of the opinions given here are obviously given by ignorant people.arkansas wasnt where i was born but it will always be home to me.i lived in illinois for the first 20 years of my life but arkansas feels much more like my home state. this is a hard catergory because to rate a place you really need to stay there for a while ,not just drive through it .obviously there are some idiot yankees giving their opinions
