I don't know how they managed to make a so-called action movie be so incredibly boring, but somehow it was done. Christian Bale's character is lifeless and Matthew McConaughey provides some unintended comic relief in his laughably bad supporting role. The previews for this movie made it seem like it had nonstop action with dragons flying all over the place when in fact the dragons weren't around all that much. The first few minutes of the story are promising but it goes downhill afterwards - only rent it if you like to have some laughs at bad movies.
