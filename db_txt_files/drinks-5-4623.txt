The best soft drink ever, no question. It was here first and it's here to stay. I heard Pepsi is coming out with a Vanilla Pepsi this fall... just trying to bank off Coke's idea. It's tough because my school, although it's in Metro Atlanta, sells Pepsi in the vending machines, not Coke. Hopefully that will change soon, though...
