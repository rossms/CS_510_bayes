Oohh now Funyuns are a snack worth snacking on. I wouldn't say that they are my overall favorite but as far as a tastey, nutritionally vacant snack food goes these are a good choice. I don't eat these very frequently but every once in a while I get and urge and devour a whole bag of these at one sitting. The biggest problem with Funjuns is that, if not chewed properly, they will slice up the roof of your mouth like tiny paper cuts. It's like their some kind of forbidden fruit that only the cunning may delight in.
