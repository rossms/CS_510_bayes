I have a 1988 CR125R. The 125's are fantastic bikes from 88-96. Since 96 the 125 motor has pretty much sucked. 250's have always been great. Older suspension isn't the best, but the engines have tremendous horsepower for their size; newer suspension is great but its coupled with a slow ass motor. Honda dirtbikes are damn near indestructable and very fast, if a bit of attention is paid to them they'll run forever.
