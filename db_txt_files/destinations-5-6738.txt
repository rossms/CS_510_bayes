Utah really is a beautiful state and if you love the outdoors there's enough to keep you occupied for years to come. Fantastic skiing, moutain climbing, rock climbing, backpacking and on and on. If you go stop at Moab and ride the slick rock it's incredible. Visit Arches National Park, hit Zion National Park, and if your feeling bold take a tour of the tabernacle and while your there send a bible to a friend (they send it to them free of charge and your friend will appreciate the gift, especially if it's hand delivered) A great state with tons to offer I look forward to going back.
