5 years ago I drove the extra miles to go to the big blue... But now Hollywood is clean, organized, and the staff @ my local store is so friendly.... and (YES they always know my name!) I would not consider going anywhere else..... Not to mention they now have a cool game store to buy used games. My kids love to try the new games! The past is the past....but now they have got it going on! :)
