I did a dual BS/MBA program. The program is very intense but it prepared me for a job in management consulting. Today, I work as an Engagement Manager at Bain Co. I know at least 15 other RBS grads here. Initially, not having any work experience was difficult, but once I got hired (4 months after graduation in 1999), the intensity and quantitative nature of the program helped me prepare for success in the real world. I took classes in Spanish, Pharma Managment, Strategy and Derivatives. It was cool!
