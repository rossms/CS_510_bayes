I know Borders is now a monster chain store, but I first started shopping there when I was a student at the University of Michigan and Borders was still an independent bookseller with a single store in Ann Arbor. Then after graduating I worked for Borders for several months near Chicago. While I didn't like the job much, I thought the store itself was great. They only hire people who pass a book test (at least that used to be the case), so the salespeople are generally pretty knowledgeable. The selection is great, and Borders, to my biased mind, just has a better atmosphere than Barnes and Noble.
