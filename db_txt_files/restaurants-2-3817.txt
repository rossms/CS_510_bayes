One time in about 1983,i was playing Defender and i walked over to my mom to get more change.As i strolled past the animatronic band,Jasper Jowels reached out like a somnambulst from a German expressionist film and grabbed my arm.I swear they used the infrastructure to the Bionic Bigfoot,the pain was etraordinary.I managed to escape with minor bruising and a slight tear in my Life Sucks t shirt.Later i realized the secret to these horrible automatons. Rope sausage.. rope...sausage.
