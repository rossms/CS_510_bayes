I get a sense he knows Football but somehow cannot translate that into a consistent performance from his teams. Mack Brown proved that UNC has the potential to be an elite Football prorgam. Karl Torbush showed how a good program can be run into the ground. Bunting just seems out of place here. He should probably be coaching a Big East or MAC school.
