Sin City is almost like three movies - two of which are very, very good, and one that doesn't quite measure up. As Kamylienne mentions, the movie is extremely artistic, and possibly one of the more violent movies I have ever seen. Mickey Rourke is absoulutely fantastic, and Bruce Willis, Elijah Wood, and the incomparable Jessica Alba are all pretty good as well. You don't have to be familiar with the comic book to enjoy it - but you do have to be prepared for some gory violence. Worth seeing for the cinematography alone - Sin City is a dark, creative comic book on the big screen.
