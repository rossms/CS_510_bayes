I love Holland. I spent five months in Amsterdam having the blast of my life. Sex Drugs and Rock and Roll, it was great! It's ashame to see that some people have some sort of phobia or stigmata about Holland. Must be law enforcement buffs. It's probablly best that they never experienced it. They'd probablly be trying to throw their weight around and bust folks and end up in the pokie themselves.
