Love the TV commercials, but not really that keen on the clothing. I don't wear jeans and I hate plain white T shirts. When I walk into one of their main stores (I live in London, UK) I'm bored. There is nothing that grabs my attention. There's only one redeeming thing. I went into one of my local charity shops and saw a lovely pair of dark grey trousers (very smart, work trousers) for four pounds and fifty pence, they were originally from Gap. bargin!
