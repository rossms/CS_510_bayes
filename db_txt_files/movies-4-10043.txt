This is Adam Sandler's best movies so far. He plays a slacker named Sonny living in New York. He gets a kid on his doorstep that was actually supposed to go to Sonny's friend. So he ends up taking care of the kid and just being funny. This had a lot of really good scenes and some of it seemed pretty gross. It was a good film.
