How about those TV to movie transfers? You have to see it to believe it. With the normal confusing plot, this X-Files story brings horror to a new level. From the bees coming out of the floor in the dome, to the monsters thawing out in Antarctica, you couldn't ask for more. Out of control mayhem from a couple of agents who really are just asking for it, if you ask me.
