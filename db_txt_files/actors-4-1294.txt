after casino, he mostly played crap roles. what was rocky and bulwinkle all about??? meet the parents was pretty funny, though. i fell asleep in that one movie with marlon brando, I can't even remember the title. analyze this... no. ronin... mediocre film. even with all bad stuff, you can't deny that he's one of the greats. With performances like godfather II, even though he only spoke around 7 lines. awakening is one of my faves. casino and goodfellas are in a class of their own! so, all in all, I'd say.... 4
