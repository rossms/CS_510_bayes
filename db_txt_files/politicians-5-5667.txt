A brilliant woman with a fine character who seems to bring out the green-eyed monster of jealousy, especially in women. She and Bill produced a daughter as brilliant as they are and doing fine at Oxford. Bush's twins seem to be doing fine in getting drunk and partying. His Florida niece seems to be majoring in drug aDDICTION. Quite a contrast, right? Chelsea is lucky to have such a wonderful mother and fine role model. I like Laura Bush also but her unfortunate girls have to fight their dna.
