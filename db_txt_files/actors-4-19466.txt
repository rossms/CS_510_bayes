I'm surprised to see Kelsey Grammer rated so poorly (as of 8/15/00). His Frasier character on Cheers was classic. And, as a big fan of the TV Show The Simpsons, I give Grammer big points since he provides the perfect voice for Sideshow Bob, Krusty's overeducated, snobby sidekick who has at one time or another tried to kill Krusty, kill Bart, and marry one of Marge's sisters (either Patty or Selma, I can't remember). I'm not a huge fan of the post-Cheers Frasier TV show, but it can be amusing and Grammer always does a good job. Give the guy a break - he's worth at least 4 stars.
