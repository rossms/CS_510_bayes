Culpepper is a freak of nature. At 260 lbs with lightning speed, he is just about unsackable. Blitz a corner? Culpepper just ignores it - will take the hit and still throw a perfect pass. A defensive end breaks free? Doesn't matter - no 300 lb man will be able to catch this QB. Culpeper is just too mobile. What i can't get over is Culpeper's touch - for a guy that big to be able to throw that soft a ball on the run... amazing. If he can learn to hold on to the ball a little better, he may become the league's best QB.
