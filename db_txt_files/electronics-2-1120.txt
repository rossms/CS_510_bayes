I got Sprint PCS as a trial cell phone to see if I need a phone. I think that the plan was not very good as far as minutes of air time compared to PacBell. Also Sprint dropped many of my calls and did not work in central CA at all on the 101. My purposes of getting a mobile phone was further discouraged when my hometown was considered long distance when Sprint claimed no roaming charges. The only good thing is no contracts.
