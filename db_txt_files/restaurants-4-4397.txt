Looking for food overloading with grease and homestyle gravy??? Then go to Cracker Barrel. They are dedicated to making you full, and stuffed. If you went there on Thanksgiving, they would have to roll you out of the place. The food is extremly tasty, and they treat you as if you were part of the family, in this matter The Waltons.
