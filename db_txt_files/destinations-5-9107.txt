The Taj Mahal is considered by many experts as the most beautiful building ever constructed. The structure is actually a mausoleum of the mughal Empress Mumtaz Mahal, the wife of Emperor Shah Jehan. She died in 1630 during childbirth. The emperor planned to erect a matching mausoleum for himself across the river, save out of back marble.
