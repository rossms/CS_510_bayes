One review says Now newbies can be webmasters...great! That's like saying, Now women can vote...great! or Now blacks can sit in the front of the bus...great! or Now the people on the east side of Berlin can travel to the west side of Berlin...great! Just because you find learning html fun and exciting, don't force the rest of us to do it if there's an automated alternative. That's like feeling smug walking from Chicago to Detroit and belittling all the newbies doing 75 on I-94. Go for it!
