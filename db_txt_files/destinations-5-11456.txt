The Galapagos are Fantastic. Other than the maine island where there is a civilian population the archipelago is uninhabited. Incredible wildlife, and of course the giant turtles that are toatally unafraid of human contact (something that cost many a turtle their lives back in the days when merchant ships would stop there on their way across the Pacific and load up on fresh meat). If you go be respectfull it's a delicate environment and fading fast.
