I just find the characters of Garth and Wayne Campbell to be totally annoying and rude. The SNL skit was what turned we off of the show, and I just couldn't take it anymore. We have Dana Carvey who is usually very funny, who in this acts like a fool. Mike Myers is usally fairly amusing, but he is total crude is this. It's only for die-hard fans of anyone who enjoyed the stupid skit.
