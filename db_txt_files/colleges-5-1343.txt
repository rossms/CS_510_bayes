Hopkins has a little bit of everything for everybody. The campus was pretty, and it's only getting better. Alumni giving sucks and that's why we rank lower than normal in rankings, not because of academics. I'm graduating in May, and respect I'll have in wearing a class ring that says hopkins will go a long way. But as an African American, I am very proud to say I graduated from here, but going to a campus where caucasians and asians ruled was not all that fun. Yet, admissions are doing more to reach blacks and other qualified minorities that overlook the option of my awesome soon-to-be alma mater!!!!
