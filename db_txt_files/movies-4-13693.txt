I really liked this movie. How many of us have been taught by wonderful mentors using unorthodox teaching methods and showed us not just to appreciate ourselves, but life and the people around us? Seize the Moment . The messges in this movie are clear: individualism, appreciation and most of all finding our passion. Standing for what we truly believe in and holding these principals with us for the rest of our lives stemmed from somewhere and any teacher that can teach that is more than a mentor, but a true gift.
