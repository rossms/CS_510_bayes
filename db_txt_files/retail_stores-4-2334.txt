I really love Winco Foods, my boyfriend is from Idaho and has shopped there for years. We now have a location in Fresno and I have always loved shopping there. The checkers have always been helpful, except one that was so mean that she went out of her way to be extra rude then continued to push the food at me the whole time I was bagging so that everything was getting smashed. I just kept bagging as quick as possible. I guess Albertsons is the place to go for a smile.
