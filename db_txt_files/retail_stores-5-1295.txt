Nordstrom can be a bit stuffy and over priced at times, however anything you need or want you will get help from their sales associates. No matter what you are wearing or what you know about a product you will get help, and it won't be overbearing. I had the greatest experience with a sales woman at the Flatirons crossing mall in CO. She taught me about suits and helped me find the right size and fit. Even though I couldn't afford a suit from Nordstom I was able to gain the information I needed and bought a suit at Nordstrom Rack.
