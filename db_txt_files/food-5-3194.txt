My birthday was the other day and instead of a cake, I wanted to try something like a pie. I always like the home to smell of baked goods so I purchased the Marie Callender's Dutch Apple pie. It was the best and most appetizing desert I have ever tasted. The flavor just stayed with you. Even with a scoop of your favorite ice cream on top didn't distract from the rich taste. I have tried other frozen brands and the crust was hard and flavorless. Marie's on the other hand was moist with a generous supply of fruit. The holidays are just around the corner and I am making room in my freezer for her assortments.
