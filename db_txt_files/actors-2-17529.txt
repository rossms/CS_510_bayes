Here is one we don't have to worry about much longer. Kim USED to be good. She was at the top for a long time. As an actress, she is doing the best she can with the horrible writing on GL these days. But, she is leaving the show soon, anyway. Her character is a tired cliche of it's old self and you can tell by her performance lately that she is too.
