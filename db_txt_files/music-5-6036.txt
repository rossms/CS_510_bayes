One of the best all time Rock albums... Highlights are Tarot Woman, Stargazer and ALITB. Dio is superb, Blackmore is amazing... If people only made music this good now, and worried less about the commercialism... Jason - it's not rubbish - it's classic rock that will live long after you and I are buried six feet under, mate.
