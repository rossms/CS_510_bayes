When I lived in San Diego from 1998-2004, I took it all for granted. Though I loved the weather, I wasn't a big fan of its traffic, the people were kind of snobbish, and everything was kind of costly. Since I moved to Houston, I wanna go back. The quality of radio stations in SD are much much better than Houston.
