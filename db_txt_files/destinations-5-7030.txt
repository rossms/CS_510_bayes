I can't say enough good things about this city. There is so much to do, whether you are looking for theater, drinking, dancing, sight seeing, history, walking, or shopping there is no where else to compare. I have been there 4 times and I can't wait to be there again. I come alive when I am in London. I love the fact that it has old, historical sights and also vibrant modern places. I love the narrow back streets in the City. I love the churches. I love finding places that offer little hints of years gone by. Believe me, its the best city in the world, and I have seen quite a few cities.
