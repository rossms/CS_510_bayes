I just tried this one and it gave me such a rush I had to sit down afterward. That hasn't happened since back in the day, B! I've found that most of the turkish varieties are really smooth but lack the power to give you a nice high (which is incredibly annoying) but this one is definitely an exception. Burns longer than most of the other turkish blends, interesting and satisfying taste, snobbish wrapping. Totally caught me by surprise. Definitely belongs up there with Kamel Reds. Give it shot'
