Margaret Thatcher was one of Britain's greatest rulers. Yes, she had faults, and yes she was strict, but that was what Great Britain needed at the time! She never backed down (ex. Falklands...) and she whipped the UK back into shape. Bravo Maggie!! It may be the cock that crows, but it's the hen that lays the egg. -Margaret Thatcher, PM
