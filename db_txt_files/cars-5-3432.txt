I have been a happy and very satisfied RAV4 owner for over a year now. The RAV4 is a comfortable driving machine as well as a functional one. I take very seriously my purchase of vehicles. I have a high standard to which I compare and rate vehicles when I am purchasing. When all was said and done, I chose the RAV4 because of its dependability, durability, among functinoality (among other things). I would highly suggest this vehicle to anyone looking at a CRV, Escape, Tracker, whatever...you won't regret it.
