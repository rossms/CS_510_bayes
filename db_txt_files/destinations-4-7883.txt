As a crime buff, this was like visiting a shrine, although I never ventured inside. I wanted to, but they were playing Mutant Ninja Turtles at the time and even my Dillinger-obsession wasn't enough to overcome my antipathy. Still, it was enough to stand outside, to walk to the alleyway where the desperado finally fell, and to soak up the ambiance. (Hopefully, that doesn't sound too morbid, but Dillinger was one of my childhood heroes).
