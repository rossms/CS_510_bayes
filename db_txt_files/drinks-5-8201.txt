Except for the big crowd in the summer, this fountain is great. The huge marble statues are very sensual and they really evoke a dolce vita. The contrast of the azure water on the white marble is amazing. The fountain is rich, yet simple and surrounded by 1800 buildings that just add to it. Watch out: do not get ripped off by thieves or businesses.
