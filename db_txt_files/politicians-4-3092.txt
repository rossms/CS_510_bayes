Which lie is worse: A campaign promise not kept: Read my lips, no new taxes A denial of criminal activity: I am not a crook Another denial of criminal activity: I did not trade arms for hostages Or, a denial of a private sexual matter I did not have sexual relations with that woman As for the other stuff, Whitewater, Travelgate, Troopergate, etc, zero plus zero plus zero equals zero
