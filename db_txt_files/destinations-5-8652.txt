I am an experienced chewer myself,i have been chewing for 2 years this coming chritmas.I think skoal is great.Nothing beats the feeling of a nice gagger soaking in your lower lip. Mint is possibly the best flavor because you can't purchase peach in our lovely country of canada.I have several friends who also enjoy chewing(Macleod,Sherm) these two pals are pros.Sometimes they have DEE BIGGEST chews in....its rediculous.Anyways to all you fine chewers out there i hope you continue to take part in the fine sport of gaggin and take care!
