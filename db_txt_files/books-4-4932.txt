I never really enjoyed this book simply because I was assigned to read it in English class. However, after reading it on my own time, I really appreciated it. This novel truly portrays human savagary and greed, but unlike Orwell and Golding, through a different light. Not so much violence, but mind manipulation and revenge. The love story dragged on at some points, but really made the story worth reading. I agree that this does not really deserve to be deemed a classic, but it certainly was a good novel.
