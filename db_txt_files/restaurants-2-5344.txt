I have experienced very poor service in every Friendlys regardless of the location. After observing the help for a while I came to the conclusion that the system that they use asks too much of the staff. The waiters and waitresses are always busy and running around yet the service is rotten. If they would let the waiters and waitresses do their job and not 50 other miscellaneous things the service would improve significantly.
