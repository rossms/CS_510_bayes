Fresca is the most refreshing of drinks. I just discovered it not too long ago and now I am constantly on the search for it. It is only in certain markets. It is like Squirt but it doesn't have sugar. I first heard of Fresca when I read about 'Sugar Busters', a diet that you can't have any sugars on (breads, fruit, certain vegatables, candy, everything bascially) but it allows Fresca as a drink. So I tried it. It is light, not as aspertine tasting as Diet Coke, and has a great grapefruit flavor. It makes you burp a lot since it is really carbonated. It is so good.
