I'm from IU and I'm tired of watching the team steadily slide down the rankings. It all started after the loss to Maryland for the championship - a disappointment that Knight would've been able to pull the team out of. As far as the chairs and choking and all that: some of the best coaches of any sport ever were good because they led through intimidation. Just look at where Indiana has gone and where Texas Tech has gone.
