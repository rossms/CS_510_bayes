The only problem with this park is that it is so far to get too. Very beautiful but nothing really different from Banff National Park.. spend your time there and avoid the long drive to Jasper. The only thing worth seeing in Jasper is the Glacier which is at the southern tip of Jasper National Park. go there but go no further. However, the drive from Calgary to Edmonton through the National Parks is truely more spectacular than the one from Calgary to Deadmonton through Red Deer.
