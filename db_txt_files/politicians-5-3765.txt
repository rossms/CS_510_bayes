If I had my chance to vote again, it would go straight Republican!! They've shown me a class act. George Bush and Dick Cheney have shown true dignity and qualities I'd like to see in a President and Vice President. We should be honored to have these two men leading our country. At least, we would know where we stand because it seems to me that Bush and Cheney know WHO they are already. Gore is acting like a child who can't be in charge of all the childhood games. Please algore, give it up for Americans sake.
