Quite possibly one of the most underrated coaches in all of college basketball. Did anyone out there seriously have Michigan State beating Duke and Kentucky, two of basketball's great powerhouses, and getting to the final four? He already has a national championship and he's turned the 2004-05 Spartans into the best team nobody knew about. Oh, by the way, what was that about the Big Ten being a weak conference this year? yeah, that's what i thought.
