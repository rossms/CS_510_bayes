He's tough and has a great arm. Has a world of potential. If he can add some touch on his passes and make decisions maybe a split second sooner he'll be fine. He looked efficient last year in his first year in a real NFL offense; not a screwed-up Spurrier offense. He was also efficient with receivers who couldn't catch, an inconsistant running attack, and very little protection. I like this guy's potential.
