I get such a kick out of reading people's misspelled, gramatically incorrect blistering tirades against Jackson's so-called ignorance. A classic comment is Jesse your stupid and ignorant. Don't you mean you're ? Jesse is a great American who should be revered and respected for his efforts to unify America, and represent the underrepresented and disenfranchised. All of YOU need to get a clue.
