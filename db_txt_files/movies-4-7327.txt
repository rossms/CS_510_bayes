My God, this movie is funny. I can't go to a chain restaraunt anymore without giggling at the chicks-who-wear-buttons. The movie will make you appreciate the job you already have or make you sympathize with the main character because you HATE your job. Pretty funny stuff. . .watch in revulsion as the main character has a vision that his boss is having sex with his girlfriend.
