This city is second to none as far as I am concerned and I am blown away by the ignorance of some of these reviews. It is NOT just about economy folks. Montreal may be one of the most visually stunning cities in the world and there is truly something for everyone here from culture to shopping to museums to outdoors to nightlife the city has it ALL. If you live there and you hate it you are a boob!
