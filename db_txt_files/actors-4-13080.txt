Brittany has managed to impress me amazingly with her only her few roles. Some of her films have been disastrous but she always manages to outshine them. Unconventionally beautiful, she has handled every genre like a pro. Her work in Girl Interrupted is fantastic and she showed real comedic knack in Just Married. She's even terrific at voice-overs with her role as Luanne on King of the Hill. One of the best new actresses on the scene.
