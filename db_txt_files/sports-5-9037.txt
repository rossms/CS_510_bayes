This guy reminds me of Tiny Archibald. He seems to be moving at twice the speed of everyone else on the court. Practically won the championship single-handedly last year and should be a star for years to come. Also was the best player in the last Olympics, and is at his best when the game is on the line. I don't see how anyone would have a problem Manu.
