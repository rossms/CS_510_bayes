Setting the gay marriage issue aside, I am Blown Away by the great job he has done. Universal health care for every citizen 24 and under. Free wireless for the whole city. Fighting the crime rate in the worst neighborhoods by showing up in person after murders, drive bys, etc... I don't like to be spy'd on, but bringing Chicago style cameras to watch high crime rate corners. He is not afraid to do stuff. When he moves into State and National politics it will be San Francisco's loss.
