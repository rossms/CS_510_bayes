Groundhog Day seems to be on USA/TNT/TBS just about every week, but I catch myself watching it every time that it is on. Bill Murray is great. I enjoyed watching his character change from being completely exasperated by his situation to taking full advantage of it to really growing. Chris Elliot was also really funny, particularly towards the end when he is trying to pick up a beautiful woman. I'm sure you have already seen this film, but if you haven't, check it out.
