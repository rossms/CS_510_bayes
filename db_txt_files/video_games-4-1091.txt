This is one of those games that people OTHER than your own parents would ever get you--I think I drove my parents nuts with that awful buzzing noise. I got pretty good at it after a while, though, it's good practice for fine hand-eye coordination. I sure hope that guy on the table had good health insurance . . . . It taught me two very important things: 1) Patience is a virtue, and 2) I probably should avoid being a surgeon.
