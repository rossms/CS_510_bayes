This year Bobby Cox has done his best job bringing along good young talent as he has always done these last 14 years. Going for 14th staraight Division Title deserves rating of 5.0 even over any manager including my favorite Joe Torre. I admire his managerial success over the years without as much talent as the Yankees.
