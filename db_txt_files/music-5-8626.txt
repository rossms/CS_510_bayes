This is one of the best music video I have ever seen. With great melody and rythm give you the all around pleasure you can expect from this kind of music. The composition of the act and scene is unique and Ricky, as always, has played his role to the hoghest level of perfection. My opinion is highly favourable and really don't understand negative opinion about it, only if something personaly is involved in it. Objectivly She Bangs is one of the greatest music videos around.
