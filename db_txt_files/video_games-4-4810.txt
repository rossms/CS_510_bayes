Really good but becomes a little bit of a drag when you have to start back tracking through levels. The twist midway is pretty cool but I would have rather had more out door levels and interaction with other marines than just fighting the flood by yourself. The battle scenes between the flood and the covenant are the most amazing things i've ever seen on console or pc and the vehicles are slick as hell. I think that Halo is a very good (but not great) game and I'm really looking forward to Halo 2.
