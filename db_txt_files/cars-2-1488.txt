What a peice of junk. My friend has one and when he wants to go on a long drive and can't afford to risk breaking down, he takes my car. the turbo lag is almost 3 secs, by that point you don't need it any more. The steering is a joke and it is not very pretty. The inside is comfortable but in the last 3 months my friend has cracked his axel, steering column and had transmission problems. For the money you can buy a lot better.
