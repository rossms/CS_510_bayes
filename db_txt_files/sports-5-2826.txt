The Indians were knocking on the door last season. Unfortunately they were hit with a string of injuries that curtailed their run at first. Given the young, inexperienced players and the lack of a closer I think he is doing a great job. They have a good, young rotation, good defense, and a very good offense. How about a closer and a legitimate power hitter (could be Victor Martinez)? With Eric's work ethic and enthusiasm the Indians are on the rise!
