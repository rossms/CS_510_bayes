Maybe it's just me, but I just don't see the point in adding crisped rice to chocolate. It really doesn't add any flavor, just a bunch of little crunchy things. This one's probably better than Nestle Crunch since Hershey's chocolate is of a higher quality than Nestle's though, so if, for some reason, you DO enjoy crisped rice in chocolate, you might prefer this one over Nestle Crunch... assuming you can find this almost-impossible-to-find candy bar, that is.
