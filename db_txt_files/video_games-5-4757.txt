What a great game! I would have to say that morrowind is deffintly one of the pinnacles of electronics, with a huge world like that massive size, theirs always something to do, also their is great music that sets the mood for the game, whether in a room of panic, or in a shrine of fear, the music suits the time, you could play all you want becuase after you beat the game their still is a lot O' things to explore! with a world so big and a lot else to concentrate on, the graphics are pretty decent, for people who are looking for a long, good plot game, this is for you!
