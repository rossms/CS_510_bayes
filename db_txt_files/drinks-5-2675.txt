I have been getting Gevalia for 12 years and I and my husband and family and friends love the coffee. The only thing that I don't like is that I have spent over 50.00 dollars every 4 weeks with these people and not one time have they sent me anything 4 being so loyal to them...(sorry) except for a little pouch of coffee that noone wants....But 4 the new people they r now giving them a 12 cup coffee maker and a cup...WHAT IS UP WITH THIS CRAP!!!!!! Let me know that u appreciate me some times or I will switch you like I did the phone company(say bye to BELLSOUTH and hello BIRCH)
