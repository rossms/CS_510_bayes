I just don't like her stuff anymore. Believe me, back in the 80's I was all about Madonna. I was even Madonna for Halloween one year but as time goes on, I like her less and less. I like the song Ray of Light but even that is not great. It is so disappointing to me that all the music artists I used to like get worse with each album. It could be my taste in music or that I am getting older, I don't know.
