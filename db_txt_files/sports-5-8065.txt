I love Allen I. He is the best player in the NBA and the only reason that I am still watching games. He is exciting, provocative and the sexiest man in the world. He is skilled and intelligent and his critics know this, that's why they hate him. They are jealous because he don't give a ****. They pick on him because he is emotional, isn't that what is missing in the league. Everytime they talk trash about him he continues to get better so keep talking.
