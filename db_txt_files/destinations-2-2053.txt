Probably pretty low on my list of ideal destinations, primarily because it wouldn't be too wise for me to be wandering around as an American over there right now... if things ever settle down, i wouldn't mind checking it out - there's a lot of history over there, and as we are learning now - a lot about Islamic culture that the US doesn't understand. It might be cool to experience some of it for myself, as opposed to reading about in the context of bombing missions, terrorism, and starvation.
