While nothing may beat the CN Tower in Toronto...this is a close second. A very close second and if you are worried about the $12 elevator ride, there are ways around it. You can bypass the observation deck and head straight to the bar the floor above. That way you get to spend $12 on a drink and get the elevator ride for free. A much better deal if you ask me...although you have to fight for a viewing spot.
