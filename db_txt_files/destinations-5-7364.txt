Paris is one of the great walking cities. For those who consider the French rude, you just have to interact according to their customs instead of your own. The French are not just Americans who speak French. They interact on a much more formal level. Walk up to a French person and ask them a question and you can expect a rude answer. You've just insulted him. Instead, go up to a French person and say hello, ask for help, and then ask your question and you'll probably get a very polite answer. He won't however treat you like some lost brother and greet you as a great friend. Why should he? He isn't afterall.
