Bob Feller is one of those players whose ranking among the greatest ever will be forever argued. He compiled a .657 win percentage over 10 of his 18 seasons but missed the better part of four seasons to WWII which were in his prime. A devastating fastballer who still finished with a career .621 win pct., Feller still shares the ML record of 12 one-hitters. Had he been able to play those missing seasons, Bob Feller may have easily been one of the single greatest of all time.
