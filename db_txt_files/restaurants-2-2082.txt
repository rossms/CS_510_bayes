Very overpriced, most regular subs are almost ten bucks. The employees are also anal about the toppings that go on the sub. They're reluctand to even give you your sub on whole wheat if it doesn't normally come on it. The food is pretty good, but I like Subway a lot better, and it looks like most other people do too, because at lunch time, I notice Subway is always packed full but Quizno's usually only has one one two other people in it.
