Jeter is one of the most dedicated players out there! I dont see how anyone couldn't have respect for him! Look at everything he's done statistically and outside of baseball... He's a huge assest to baseball, he has a fabulous work ethic, attitude toward the game and is a great roll model. I personally absolutley adore Jeter and the Yankees but even if you dont like the Yankees you have to admit Jeter is amazing!
