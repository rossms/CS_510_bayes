Susan Sarandon is a great actress. It is funny how I am trying to think of what she was in that blew me away and the only movie I can think of at all that she was in, is Dead Man Walking. I don't know if that proves anything, but it is more her name and what everyone says, than her real talent. She has made some bold statements recently about the election. Who cares what she thinks? She is like you and me, but is in the movies. It seems the press cares what she thinks as an individual but I could care as much as I care about what the guy in front of me at the drugstore thinks.
