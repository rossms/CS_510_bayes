4 Stars only because I'm tired of hearing how fantastic he is. He left the Mariners, they got better. He left the Rangers, they got better. He has not won anything but individual awards and not had ONE significant at bat in the last 4 years, but people crown him the second coming. He's just a baseball version of T-Mac, or Vince Carter except he's on a winning team.
