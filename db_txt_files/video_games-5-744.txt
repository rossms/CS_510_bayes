I love Trivial Pursuit. Its definitely a fun game for a person like me who loves random knowledge and facts. I recently played the 90's Edition with a group of people, and I knew almost every question. Playing the older editions of the game has often included many questions that were way before my time, but this edition hits everything from my lifetime.
