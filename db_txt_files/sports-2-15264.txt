Favre has been over the hill and living on a gunslinger mentality for too long. Plus he has no class. His comments Thursday night on National TV regarding Aaron Rodgers... I have no responsibility to teach him.. typify the spoiled and selfish NFL player of today. He is just stupid and Bart Starr must be embarrassed himself with Favres idiotic comments & lack of class. Rodgers will replace him soon.....back to the cajun swamps wacko..
