These are truly the best cookies they have. I just moved to Michigan from South Carolina and I can't seem to find them. I want them and don't know where to get them from here. The lemon tast and the soft cookie makes this a hell of a cookie. I would choose this kind over and other. I need to find them soon! Can someone help me PLEASE!
