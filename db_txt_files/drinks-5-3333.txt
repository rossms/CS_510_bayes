Most hard cider is too sweet. This is an adult brew. It stil has that apple taste, but it doesn't seem like something a three-year old wouldn't mine, either. Woodpecker's is dry, crisp and ideal for the Guinness drinker who realizes that the mercury has moved too far up to make his/her pint enjoyable. You simply can't go wrong. Stay away from Cider Jack. That stuff is no compariaon. Also makes a good snakebite, but find all on its own, which is not something that cna be said for cider in general.
