I know that there are alot of anti Bush people out there, but that is mainly because the people of America are always uninformed about what really happens in polotics. Have any of you ever noticed that media is very strongly democratic, and they attack Bush, and other presidents for no reason? I would think that people who are smart enough to care about polotics would also be smart enough to know not to belive everything that they hear on tv, but i guess not.
