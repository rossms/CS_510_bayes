POSITIVE ATTRIBUTES: One of the safest states around- its really a peaceful place to live. It's got one of the lowest crime rates in the country and the lowest crime rate in New England except for Maine. My mother plans on moving there after her retirement because she has a thing for Vermont's beauty. Even their largest cities are modest in size, and its overall a great place to simply drive through and observe all their beauty. NEGATIVE ATTRIBUTES: I'll be damned if I can think of any.
