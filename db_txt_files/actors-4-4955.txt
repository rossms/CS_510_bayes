I know that I am breaking one of the cardinal guy rules, but I think that Mr. Pitt is a pretty good actor. It is hard to deride someone as a pretty boy when so many of his movies have him seemingly attempting to look as horrible as possible. I mean, Fight Club, Snatch, Kalifornia, etc... have him looking greasy, unshaven, scarred, and a little slimy. This is the behaviour of an actor that is actually attempting to focus on ACTING, rather than any sex-symbol status. Bravo Brad.
