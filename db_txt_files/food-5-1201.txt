Caramel-filled Mini-Eggs? I think Callmetootie is confusing these with the Cadbury CREME eggs, which come in chocolate, caramel, and white creme. The Mini-Eggs are NOT goopy AT ALL--it is hard chocolate in a candy shell... a GOOD tasting candy shell too, much better than an M M shell. The candies are NOT messy, and they taste of a great-quality chocolate!
