I have read opinions about Long Island Ice tea. I tried it yesterday. I can say that it is good but if there is someone who can help you go home. the third cup was the K.O. All what I could remember is the bartender tellng me if you don't leave the bar I will call cops !!. I don't understand why he was telling me that. even worse, I think the cab driver stole me 20 bucks. thanks god I got up this morning in my bedroom. Long Island ice tea is a good drink only if you are in a safe place. don't drink it if you are alone in a bar.
