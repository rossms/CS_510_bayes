Madonna's best EVER! This album proved to the world that Madonna was more than just another dancehall diva. It gave us a peek into her personal past and present with songs like Oh, Father and Til Death Do Us Part ! Like A Prayer certainly was a milestone in Madonna's career. Within it, she showed us a new found maturity and depth while still retaining the edge we all love her for!
