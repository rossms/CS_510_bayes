Shaq is the best post player in the NBA. Period. Look at the way he dominates offensively, and now he's even blocking shots. Nobody can guard him when he gets in the post, he's just too strong. His free throw shooting is still abhorrent, though. His form is bad, and he pushes the ball with one hand, making his shot flat. But still, you can't argue with his dominance in the post.
