This is probably one of the definitive 80's videos! It was very experimental (with the blocky, linear graphics and then the neon scribbles imposed on the video of the band performing), they did a lot of neat new things. In a way, it's kind of a preview to a future video that I found to be successful as well ( Californication by the Red Hot Chili Peppers took the video-game graphic idea and modernized it). It was very fun to watch.
