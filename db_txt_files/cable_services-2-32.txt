First, let me say that I never have trouble with my cable service, HOWEVER, the price is unbelievable. They're even charging for On-Demand services (Starz, HBO, etc.) Seems like with every new service they provide, they want an additional 4-10 dollars per month. Starz on demand is provided free to Adelphia, so why the heck are they charging us 4.95 a month for it. Even their cable internet service has slowed down because now they have 'premier' internet service and they want you to pay an ADDITIONAL 19.95 a month for that. I think they've lost their freaking minds. I'm looking into satellite.
