Best series ever. The Kahlan and Richard love life is very captivating. As a guy I will admit it really resonated in me from heartbreaking events to passionate lovemaking not over detailed . To Those people who said he copied jordan, well not really he may have been influenced by jordan, just as jordan was by Terry Brooks, and brooks to tolkien. It is also a very amusing book because richard has way to much power for his complete lack of knowledge about his magic. This evolve into some very funny situations. A must read
