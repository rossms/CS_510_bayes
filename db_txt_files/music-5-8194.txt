WHAT CAN I SAY....CREED IS JUST TOOO GOOD... I KNOW THEY ARE A CHRISTIAN BAND....THATS THE GOOD THING ABOUT THEM...THEYRE SONG WITH ARMS WIDE OPEN IS ABOUT FATHERHOOD AND THAT SHOWS AND TELLS ALOT ABOUT THEYRE BAND..THE VIDEOCLIP IS THE ONLY THING CONFUSING ME!!! BUT.....IT WAS STILL GOOD. CREED RULZ AND THATS THAT....IM THE NO #1 CREED LUVER!!!
