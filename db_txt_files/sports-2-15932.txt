Is it normal to completely hate this guy in all fashions??? I think that he is the most overrated QB of all time. I don't care how many rings he has recieved. There are certain lucky QB's that have won rings and have had a fantastic offensive/defensive line!!! Do you think that Tom Brady is better than the great Dan Marino??? Thought so...
