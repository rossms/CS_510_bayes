I looked at everything from Ducati's to Yamahas. But kept coming back to the Speed 3. I am happy I did. It is AWESOME in every way (except for the mirrors, I like my shoulders but don't like to look at them all the time) Just look at the reviews on the Internet and you will see what I mean. And last but not least is the incredible sound coming from this thing; it is unreal, sounds like a Porsche on steroids.
