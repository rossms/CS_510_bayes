I personally think this is a great video. I'm so tired of people saying she offended them by the burning crosses and being half dressed or whatever! You are totally missing the point of the video. i think it's powerful with the racial thing, viewing Jesus in a different way, just everything about it. That is another thing i respect about madonna, she doesn't care about the reactions of people.. for the most part... she puts her own thoughts and creativity into her work, and it's always a success from the majority's point of view! :)
