This is the place were we buy ALL of our electronics and appliances. We seem to get the best prices here. They have a huge selection of computer games, cell phones, computers, office furniture, appliances, cd's, stereos, speakers and a lot more! The Best Buy credit card is great too. They gave us a enormous amount to begin w/ and we had 6 months to pay it off interest free.
