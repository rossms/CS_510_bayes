Kobe is the best player in the NBA today. He's a great clutch player (The last regular season game against Portland is one example), he's the best perimeter player in the game, he's a great defensive player, he can dunk on centers (Yao for example), he's been on countless all-nba teams....etc. etc. etc. And the lakers are going all the way AGAIN...the spurs are toast. And yes, Jordan was a cheater also, but no one talks about it.
