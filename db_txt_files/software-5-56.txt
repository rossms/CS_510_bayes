I tried the freeware version of zerospyware before buying it. It worked perfectly as a freeware and I never regretted buying the full version. I use it with another free software (adaware) to get rid of all the spyware in my PC. you should use at least two anti-spy software together to get the best effect. Get a free one and buy one that you like.
