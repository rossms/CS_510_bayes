Come on, who doesn't like Mozzarella? Such a common, satisfying cheese..Wet mozzarella is even better..on a sandwich, with roasted red peppers..and who could live without mozzarella? A cheeseless pizza is no fun, ziti would be bland..what would french onion soup be without a dash of mozarella goo? Mozarella cheese is a necessity.
