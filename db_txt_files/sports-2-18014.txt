I'm an Arizona native and I have to tell it like it is; the Cardinals stink year in and year out. I still cheer for them (I have to!) but there's no expectations for them to do well. Hmmm...maybe that's the problem! If Bidwell sold the team to a real football minded owner, we might see some consistency.
