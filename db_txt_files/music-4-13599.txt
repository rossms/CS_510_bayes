Controversial as he is, there is no denying Eminem is a talented rapper. Though he more frequently than not descends into tastelessness, Eminem is very intelligent. He makes alot of valid points about our society under the umbrella of an almost parodically extreme of violent lyrics. Unfortunately, most people miss the point when it comes to his lyrics, but for these people it doesn't matter because the music is catchy and memorable too.
