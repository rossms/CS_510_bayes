I think The University of Miami is one of the best schools in the nation! It is at a great location, one of the most diverse and fastest-growing cities in America! I'm currently an undergraduate student at another university, but my dream/goal is to attend The University of Miami as a graduate student. I am a Spanish major and I'd love to continue my studies in Miami as well as study Latin American History there. U of Miami is the best and they are also the 2001 Sugar Bowl Champions!!! Go 'Canes!!!
