I leased (3 years) a new 98 Audi A6, and while it was a beautiful car with a really nice interior, and was a pleasurable drive, the quality was sub-standard for a car in this price range. I had a lot of repairs done (under warranty) and had the car out of service for extended periods of time due to unavailability of parts. I ended up paying the lease in full, and turning the car in 6 months early just to be rid of it. Whether the build quality and dealer service has improved in the past 3 years, I dont know, but I was pretty dissatisfied with my experience.
