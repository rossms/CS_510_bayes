Foul followup (that borrows heavily from the original King Kong) to the mega-hit. What keeps it from being truly horrid is three things. First, they had the good sense to include one of my favorite character actors of recent times, Pete Posthelwaite, as part of the cast. He played the legendary hunter/park ranger type. Second, the dinosaurs are great. The other thing that I like is a hilarious scream that some guy who wakes up gives when everyone's asleep and the tyrannosaurus has entered the camp and is nosing about the kids' tent. Bad, though not a totally terrible sequel.
