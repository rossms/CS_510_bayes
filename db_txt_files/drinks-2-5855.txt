Mr Pibb, to me, is nothing but a generic Dr. Pepper. Once you've tried Dr. Pepper, you can't switch to Mr. Pibb! You can just taste the imitation!! Mr Pibb is sweeter and it doesn't have as much fizz to it. When you drink it, it just kind of sits in your mouth, and that's why I don't like it- it's boring!
