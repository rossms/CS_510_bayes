Even though he ran out on my 76ers, I gotta hand it to Brown for being a fine coach. He's a proven winner who's won at several levels - National Championship, NBA Title. He's a consummate coach, he coaches the fundamentals and coaches his way, the old school way, and it's effective. He has jumped around too much in his career, but he's had success everywhere he's been.
