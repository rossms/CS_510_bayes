An underrated actress, Alyson has gotten a little typecasted after her numerous roles as the nerdy girl. She has quirky, fresh-faced appeal that works well. Extremely funny and vulnerable when given good material, I think that, with some good projects, she could really develop into a more highly regarded actress.
