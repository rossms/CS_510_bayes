Sure, Junior is a tremendous baseball player, but something about him pisses me off. I guess it should be refreshing to me that an athlete put his money where his mouth is and actually made a decision that wasn't about the money. And, I don't begrudge him for making what is still an obscene amount of $$$. Yet, he doesn't hide his smugness as well as the other players and a side of me wishes that he had remained in Seattle for the year and been booed all season long.
