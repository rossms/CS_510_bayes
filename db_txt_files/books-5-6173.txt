This is an incredibly gripping account of a climbing disaster on Everest. Krakauer does an excellent job of telling the story without getting in the way, and his expertise as a mountain climber lends authenticity to the account. Krakauer also manages to explain the tragedy in an even-handed way that doesn't lay an inordinate amount of blame on anyone. It's a short book, and you'll have a hard time putting it down before you finish it.
