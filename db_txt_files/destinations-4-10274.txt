These are pretty good. A little light on the flavor, but nice and consistent. Good burn, smooth, and seem to last a long time. I've cut back to only 5 or 6 smokes a day, meaning a pack will usually last me four days or so, and these keep very well. Basically a Marlboro in fancy packaging. My friends grandma used to smoke these (and we used to steal 'em), so they feel a little bit feminine, but I still like them.
