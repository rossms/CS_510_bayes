I love the Pizza Huts that are still restaurants! The garlic bread is THE BEST! But they are slowly turning all the restaurants into fast-food like places...the atmosphere of these new places is unfriendly and sterile, they don't have garlic bread at them, and cmon, pizza really isn't supposed to be fast food!
