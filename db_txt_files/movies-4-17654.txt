A gently amusing, appealing and certainly sexy Spanish drama, Oscar-winner for best foreign language film.In the early 1930's a likeable,easy-going young Army deserter finds shelter at the home of an ageing artist,who happens to have 4 extremely pretty daughters(among them a young Penelope Cruz)-all eager to offer their own very personal hospitality ..!Not the most ambitious or sophisticated of films,but a very definite light-hearted pleasure.
