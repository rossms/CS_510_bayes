Star Wars III, Revenge of the Sith, is the third movie in the prequel series, and the sixth installment of Star Wars. This movie answered all the questions asked in the original star wars. Although the movie had a lot of great fight scenes and special effects and the people became more realistic, I didn't like this movie too much. It was confusing at parts and hard to follow. Hayden Christenson's acting is horrible. The movie is not very consistent and the plot totally implausible.
