Obviously the people who said RED BULL ENERGY DRINK did not give them energy were not tired in the first place. It is not meant to cause a caffeine buzz (it only has 80mg - as much as a 20oz soda). The energy comes from a combination of ingredients - many of which are naturally occurring in the body - that replenish the vitamins and amino acids that are depleted in times of stress or strain. Try it sometime when you have to wake up at 5 am or are hung over - it will be your new best friend. And as for the taste - not too sweet, not too sour - I give it 5 stars. Red Bull gives you wings!
