So I'm in the process of ripping about 40 of my favorite CD's into iTunes. Prepare yourselves for a barrage of album reviews. So Brighten the Corners is my second favorite Pavement album after Crooked Rain, Crooked Rain. It's a little poppy, but it flows. Every track works with the next, and if you listen to one track, you'll most likely want to hear all of them. I think my favorites off this one are "type slowly" and "We are underused."
