Like most chains, it's not particularly good and not particularly bad and if you don't have a good coupon they're very overpriced for what it is. Domino's used be a little different way back when-better tho I can't define how-but I still like their particular taste and prefer the hand-tossed (PJ's is better for thin and their deep-dish is nothing special).
