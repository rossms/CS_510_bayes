I don't know -- this was my favorite movie when I discovered it in Jr High in 1982. When I saw it again last year, it didn't seem nearly as funny as I'd remembered. Some was still funny as hell, but the world has caught up with Monty Python and their non-sequitars aren't as novel as they seemed back then.
