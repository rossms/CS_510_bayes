C Lee, if Dean were to go off flipping burgers you would be the perfect person to teach him. You obviously know little about politics and it is amusing how you have been pathetically swayed by the media into thinking that Dean is a nut. People, his voice cracked he was shouting at a convention. Give the man a break. It was extremely overblown by the media. He is not a joke. The only thing funny here is how foolish you are. It is a shame Dean was not elected. Maybe he could get us out of the hole Bush dug. He might even be able to get you that burger flipping job back C Lee.
