an almost four. A nice movie about a teenager who grew up in England but parents are from India. She wants to play soccer, but her parents will not let her. they want her to live the traditional Indian customs. At first she has to sneak and play on an all girls team, her parents find out and want her to stop. eventually her dad takes her side. At the end she gets to live her dreams of a soccer player. Kind of predictable, but a pretty good movie.
