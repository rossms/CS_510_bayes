THIS IS MY ALL TIME FAVORITE CANDY!!! I love York Peppermint Patties so much, for their delicious and sweet taste that combines mint and chocolate. The mint is not too minty and the chocolate that coats the mint is just the right amount. I do wish they came in a larger size, but they're delicious anyways! Anyone who loves mint and chocolate should try one! THEY'RE GREAT!!!!!!!!!!
