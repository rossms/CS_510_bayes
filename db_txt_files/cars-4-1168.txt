Every thing about the 3 series seems nice EXCEPT for the manual shift. At least in the 2000 model that had a transmission made in France, the shift seemed to stick before it went into gear - not that satisfying ker-chunk you might expect from a semi-expensive German car. I am curious if other car-hounds have the same opinion, or if the shift wears in and gets smoother - this was a 7 mile vehicle.
