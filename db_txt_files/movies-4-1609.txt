This is one creepy movie! Definately a great storyline, Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt were great. VERY graphic (if you don't like graphic and bizarre depictions of death, you might want to skip this one). Very dark, very disturbing, there were a few jumpable scenes there (shocking to the point where you kind of jump out of the seat).
