I am a more of a Tar Heel fan, but there is no denying he is one of the greatest coaches of all time. People forget that coaching is not just calling plays from the sideline or determining when to call timeout, but also (and more importantly) being able to recruit the types of players he gets and then motivate them. Getting the right talent in college basketball is more important than anything and this little rat does it better than most.
