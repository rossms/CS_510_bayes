Not a great movie. One of the gayist movies I've seen. Battle scenes were good, esp. the fight scene vs the Indians with the elephants. Seeing a naked, topless Rosario Dawson was great as well. Overall , though, I just wasnt wholly impressed with the movie. Alexander's rise and success seemed to happen a bit too easily and his relations with his father and mother were play out too much ( even though Angelina Joile looked great as well.
