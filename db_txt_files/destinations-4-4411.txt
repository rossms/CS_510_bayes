I was pretty impressed with a recent visit to Providence. Unlike a lot of cities in Florida, Providence is a walkable city and a lot of emphasis around Providence is placed on physical fitness ( walks and marathons). I was surprised by the number of coffee shops and fine dining establishments in the area. I've also heard that there are more artists per capita in Providence than in any other city and it does not surprise me with the number of colleges and involvement of the colleges in the community. Like much of New England people are not very friendly and this prevents Providence from being a five star.
