Get real indeed. I have a 91 with more than 40,000 (yes that's 40K) miles on it and it has never needed major work of any kind. Gas 'em up and go. Much better than some highly overpriced noisemaker or expensive exotic with a nightmareish valve adjustment needs. Granted, the Nighthawk series isn't all that sexy to look at, but it can't be beat for fun, inexpensive, fast, two-wheeled transport. I just wish you could still get a 4 into 1 exhaust for them.
