To all tose who say Toronto I have to say get over yourselves. In any city you'll find arrogant and ignorant people, any city has crime. The fact is Toronto is vibrant and always has a lot going on. Multitculturalism is celebrated and respected and crime is low compared to other cities. This isn't fake, many people agree, the Rolling Stones love us. Cost of living is also low compared to other metropolises Canada has a few fabulous cities (Montreal, Vancouver, Ottawa, Calgary) but you know almost 1 in four Canadians live within an hour and a half of the city, this is why it gets a lot of attention.
