we travel most of the time hauling a 5th wheel camper and up until recently we always had a place to park at Cracker Barrel but recently cars are fillibg up the rv sports so we haven't any place to park. We traveled south and stopped at 3 Cracker Barrel's and couldn't get in. I don't know how you can ease the problem but I just wanted you to be aware of it. Thank You Ozzie
