Nintendo's typical creativity and brilliance shines through once more. You take pictures of about 60 of the original 150 Pocket Monsters and report them to Professor Oak. The graphics are great, with the terrain and Pokemon rendered in 3D. Also, this one of the few Pokemon games with actual Pokemon speech. The gameplay is inspired, but there's not enough levels for an extended round of replay value. But, I still recommend this Nintendo 64 game!
