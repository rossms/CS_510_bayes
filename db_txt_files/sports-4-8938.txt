An Iverson-type of player, style-wise, IMO. The bad thing is, his size hurts him like Iverson. He has the ability to put numbers up, and score at will, but he has never been the go-to guy to win games for the Pistons. He may have a better chance on another team besides the Pistons to make an impact. I realize the Pistons are in the ECF 2004, with a big opportunity to go to the Finals, but with the emergence of Tayshaun Prince and Rasheed Wallace, one wonders if he has a place there anymore. Rip will do well in the future, and he will definitely probably win a title, either this season or down the line.
