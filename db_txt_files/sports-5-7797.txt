REGGIE! REGGIE! He is great one of my favorites. Who else can shoot the trey better or more? Nobody yet. Love it when he goes to Madison Square Garden and sticks a dagger into the Knicks' heart with the killer three's. Reggie needs a ring! I also love it when he can draw the fouls. People hate on him because he is good at it no he's the best at it. He will be known as the best three-point shooter in baskeball and one of the best free-throw shooters ever. Love Ya Reggie!
