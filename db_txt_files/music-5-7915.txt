This is pure 80s Springsteen and I LOVE it! I can remember getting so excited when this video would come on! I'd sometimes turn on MTV just in the hopes of seeing it! It made me jealous, of course, of Courteney Cox, but it did give me lovely fantasy material of being pulled onstage for a dance with the guy! I just have to say, Springsteen in the 80s was the finest thing this country has ever seen!!!
