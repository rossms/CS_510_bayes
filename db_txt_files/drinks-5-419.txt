Bass Ale is a rich, full flavored amber beer with a hearty, robust taste with a smooth flavor that is able to sustain it's taste from the first one you have of the evening, down to the last. If you like Budweiser, you probably won't like Bass. When you are ready to graduate to REAL beer, try a Bass.
