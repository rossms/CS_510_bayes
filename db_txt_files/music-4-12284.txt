I believe this is Mya's second album and it's tight. Of course, 'Fear of Flying' contains two hit singles: 'Case of the Ex' and 'Free', but this album also shows how Mya has matured vocally as an artist. Her soft voice sounds stronger and more confident this second time around. I definitely think she has the potential to be the next Mariah or Whitney.
