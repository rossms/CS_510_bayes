In my opinion, Snickers is the candy bar by which all other candy bars are measured. It has the perfect balance of flavors- chocolate, caramel, peanuts and not too much nougat. Snickers bars are great in any form, but I especially like them frozen. I've tried the real frozen Snickers (in the frozen foods section), and they're fabulous, too. If I have a Snickers, I always feel that it was worth the splurge.
