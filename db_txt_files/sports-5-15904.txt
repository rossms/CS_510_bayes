Hines Ward is the best all around WR in the NFL. He gives 110% every play. Catches nearly everything as evidenced by the fact he lead the league in 2004 with the highest % of catches when targeted. He is also the best blocking WR in the game. Tough as nails and all heart. Wouldn't trade him for any other player in the league.
