I am not a Lakers' fan; I am actually anti-Lakers but this guy is thus far, unstoppable. Even though he's allowed to camp in the lane and lower his shoulder and drive into his opponent at will. I'd love to have seen him play against Chamberlain or Bill Russell. Those matchups would of been legendary! Shaq's overpowering size and strength against Russell's quickness and competitiveness; Shaq against Chamberlain's size, touch and rebounding. I'd pay to see that!
