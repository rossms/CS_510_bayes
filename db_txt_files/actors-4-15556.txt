Dana was talented and seemingly had a lot going for her. She was a wonderful actress, and the Kimberly role on Diff'rent Strokes was very fitting for her. Sadly, she cracked under the pressure of being a performer at such a young age.... started into drugs, robbed a video store, and did a few other things which got herself into trouble. She never got it straightened out, unfortunately, and died a premature death just a few years ago.
