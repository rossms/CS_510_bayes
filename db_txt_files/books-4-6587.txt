I quite enjoyed the trilogy together with the Hobbit and the Silmarilion. I can understand if it's not in everyone's taste. To compare Steven King with J.R.R. Tolkien is an insult to both. They wrote in separate genres with very different styles, and each has its own merits. If you want to compare apples and oranges, be my guest, but it's not going to give you a true measure of the merit of each author's works.
