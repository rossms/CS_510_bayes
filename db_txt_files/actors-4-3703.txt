This guy has only been in awesome ensemble films so far. I would like to see him in a character driven piece that showcases him. Johnny Depp completely outshined him in Pirates of the Caribbean while the story of LOTR outshined him in it. I think he may be amazing, but has yet had the chance to prove it. He is very attractive in a weasely kind of way.
