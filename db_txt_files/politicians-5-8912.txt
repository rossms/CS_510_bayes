President Clinton you are sorely missed!!! I would bet my lunch money that if he could run again he would wipe the floor with Bush Jr. Not only was he brilliant, charming, compassionate and handsome he was also a great leader. There will never be a politician as skilled as he is and the current presidential incarnation can't hold a candle to his record of achievement. Who would impeach a man who lied about sex or a man who lied about WMD's, connections between Iraq and 911?? I know who I would impeach and it ain't Clinton.
