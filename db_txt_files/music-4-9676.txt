Here goes: I remember watching t.v. one day and seeing the music video to Hands after almost forgetting completely about Jewel for a long time. She had put on some weight and was becoming more poetic. I got the cd and it seemed pretty strange with odd melodies, and I just skipped around really. But when you really listen to the songs, and get into them, you find some nice melodies ( Deep Water, Down So Long, Life Uncommon, Do You ). She was somewhat close to self-parody with her new poet self and golden quotes and pictures of sweaty feet in the sleeves, but as it turns out, this isn't a bad cd.
