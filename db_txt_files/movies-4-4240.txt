Ah, another good comp-animated one. And done by the basically unknown Blue Sky Studios . I liked Ray Romano as a cynical mammoth- the characters were entertaining. The running joke with scrat and his acorn was good for laughs. Lots of slapstick, it lacked some of the more mature humor that made Shrek amazing. It's worth seeing still- somewhat shorter, but a fun flick.
