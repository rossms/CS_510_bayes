I might not be a USC fan, but I can tell you Reggie Bush is for real. Averaging 9 yard a carry. If you think this year he was good, look at last. Averaged 10. 5 yards a carry, AMAZING. If he had a good game against Texas you would see his name across every billboard and paper. USC has game and with Reggie there AMAZING. Don't judge him cause he didn't have a good game at the Rose Bowl. He still has proven a lot. he deserves a number 1 pick in the draft. WOW! HE IS GREAT!
