Enough tough the park charges for lockers, floats, and chairs; I feel it is a good value. The lines are shorter and the drive is not that bad! It not a large theme park but it is a good value! I feel I will get my money's worth for my season passes. My daughter and I had a wonderful time!It's great to be able to go a water park and amusement park all in the same day.
