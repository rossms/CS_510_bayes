This software works fine and does exactly what it should (just like other Norton applications), but the trouble is that it seems like some nasty viruses or something will eventually cause Norton programs to hang or crash. This happens to me one about every 6 months. Norton doesn't help with their tech support... Microsoft doesn't help either. The only thing you can do is to uninstall the software and reinstall it. Most won't notice these things unless you use Microsoft Outlook (Express) for email - the trouble seems to be with the way Norton and Outlook interact.
