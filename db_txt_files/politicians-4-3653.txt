So far, reminding us all what it USE to be like to have honor and integrity in the White House. Regardless of what he actually is able to accomplish, at least he will go about it with honesty and character without having to question his alternative self serving motives . I can finally allow my 8 year old to watch the president in his speaches and not have to explain why he is defending himself in a legal matter once again!
