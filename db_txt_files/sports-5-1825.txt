My favorite baseball team. They have the best mangagement, consistantly outstanding pitchers, and have been sucessful despite having a relatively low payroll. Their payroll is less than half of the Yankees! Everyone thought, including me, that after losing great pitchers such as Maddux, Glavine, Millwood, and Moss, that the Braves' era was over. Well gues what, they are back in 1st place again.
