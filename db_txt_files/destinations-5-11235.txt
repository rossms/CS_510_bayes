Nantucket is such a beautiful island. I've been going there since I was a child and have many great memories of our family vacations there. Unfortunately, it's become totally overrun with tourists to the point where it's almost like a theme park. You know it's bad when a tourist/visitot (me) thinks it's too touristy, the island has been stolen from the locals (at least for 3 months a year). However, there are still lots of places to get away from it all and if you choose your dates carefully you can avoid most of the crowds, ie. early in the season of just toward the end.
