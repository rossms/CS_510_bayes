I've flown them three times and was very satisfied with the experiences. One time, I booked a flight with a friend to Vegas, and he broke some ribs in an accident a few days before our trip, so we cancelled the trip. America West offered a FULL REFUND (we bought non refundable tickets)--all we had to do is send a doctor's note.
