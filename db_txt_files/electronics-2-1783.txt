I don't think that this Philips/Magnavox VCR is a really good product. The VCR worked fine for a day, then I had to return it after the time didn't want to record, and then I finally programmed it to tape, but only the sound recorded and not the picture. Would you really want a VCR like this? I don't think so. I think it's best to shop around until you find a VCR that suits you.
