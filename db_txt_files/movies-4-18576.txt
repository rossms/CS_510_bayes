True story - my little brother's best friend Ashley saw this movie at a very young age, and to this day, is terrified of clowns. I remember when my brother was like 12 I took him to Ashley's house so they could go trick or treating together. My brother was wore a clown costume (unnknowingly) and I remember that when Ashley took one look at him she kind of lost it, and I had to take my brother home for his plan b costume.
