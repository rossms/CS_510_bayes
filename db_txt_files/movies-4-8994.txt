My favorite of all Chevy Chases comedies... much more than ANY of the National Lampoon vacation movies. This one actually shows the intelligent (intelligent?) side of Chevys' humor. The quick wit and narration are favorites of mine. Then, of course, there's always Dr. Jellyfinger! Hilarious! Even CallMeTootie likes it and he doesn't like anything!!
