This school has potential to be the most amazing place to spend the next four years of my life. It is such a shame to put this opportunity to waste, because i have not been able to get out of my dorm for fear of being attacked by all of the she-apes running around on campus. What horribly ugly girls we have here. We recently were given a 60 million dollar grant and if they would put that to buying some attractive girls or campus plastic surgery i may consider staying here.
