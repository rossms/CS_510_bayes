I have created a petition for Governor Huckabee letting him know that Arkansans are unhappy with his granting clemencies to convicted murderers. Please visit the link to see and sign the petition. We only have until the beginning of August to make our opinions known. http://www.petitiononline.com/792004/petition.html
