Model 6360 actually. I have had this phone for twp years and have had zero problems or complaints under heavy use for work and personal use. For those that still live in rural areas that do not have all the up to the minute cell system features (i.e. picture and web capability etc.) it has everything there is up to that point and they all work flawlessly. Su until they update your rural system this is the phone to get in the interim.
