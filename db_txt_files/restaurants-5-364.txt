Wendy's is the best, hands-down. They generally have their food WAITING for you when you drive up -- you're usually the one that's late. Love the single combo....and now, I can get chili or a salad in place of the fries in my combo FOR NO EXTRA MONEY! Gotta love than. Out of any fast food, they are #1 in my book.
