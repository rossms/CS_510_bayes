gruden is a good coach I couldn't really appreciate until he left the raiders cause I'm a broncos fan...I seen what he did this year in tampa and it is unbeleivable.....I still think Mike Shanahan is the best coach in the NFL..He is the only active coach to win back to back superbowl titles..actually the only coach with two titles period..at the end superbowls is how you judge a coach.
