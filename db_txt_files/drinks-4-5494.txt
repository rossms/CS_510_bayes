7-up to me is not quite as good as Sprite- a bit too syrupy - but still a good stand-by. I remember drinking it as a kid in those great-looking green glass bottles. I associate it with bowling cuz I used to always have it whenever I went bowling. It does give me sort of a homey feeling that Sprite does not.
