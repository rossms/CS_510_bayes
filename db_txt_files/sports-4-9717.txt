The Sixers are a good team, very good in fact, but they just can't seem to score consistently unless Allen Iverson is on the floor. The addition of Mutumbo greatly improves team defense, though. They have a host of role players, like Raja Bell, that give them good depth. But the offense seems to revolve around A.I. When he's on, that's fine and the team is sucessful, but when he gets off to a slow start, they get bogged down in the offense and don't consistently score. That said, guys like Eric Snow and Aaron McKie always seem to hit shots when their team needs it most.
