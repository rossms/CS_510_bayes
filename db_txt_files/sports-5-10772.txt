Frank Beamer is a great coach no doubt, but he is also a truly great man. He has made outstanding contributions to this community and to his alma mater. He is a wonderful father who also treats his players as his own family. For those of you ignorant enough to deride the burn on Coach Beamer's face, it was the result of a childhood accident. This experience undoubtedly helped to build the great character he exhibits in his daily life and as the leader of the truly great football program he is responsible for building.
