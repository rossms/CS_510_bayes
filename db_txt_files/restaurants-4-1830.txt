Although they do not have many items I like, what I do eat there is good. Their chicken soft tacos are excellent, although sometimes they don't put quite enough chicken in them. Their nacho cheese has yet to be replicated in grocery store items. Also, their cinnamon twists make a great dessert. Their prices are reasonable and service typically fast. The one major stumble is they contanstly get special orders wrong, such as not getting an item with only the chicken and the tortilla, for example.
