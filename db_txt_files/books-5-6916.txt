The Wheel of Time Series by Robert Jordan is tied for best series I have ever read. He makes the world come to life with detailed descriptions of the people and the places. In my opinion Jordan is a genious for being able to conceive of all of the things he does. A must read series for anyone who feels like reading for awhile.
