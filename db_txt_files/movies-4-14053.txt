Possibly Ron Howard's best serious film (I have a soft spot for his comedies and fantasies--Night Shift, Splash and Cocoon, his first three movies that are my favorites of his). The period detail in this movie is wonderful and the story is riveting. Even though we know the outcome, it's classic suspense.
