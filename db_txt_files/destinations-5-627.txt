A charming little town built around the mining industry. The impact of mining is everywhere - from the fabulous stone and crystal nick nacks sold in the little shops to the silver everywhere you look. If you get a chance to go to this town, make sure you stay up on the hill. There is a really quaint Holiday Inn (I'm not kidding) with a spectacular view of all of the white-thatched roofs of the town. Also, make sure to spend some time in the Zocalo. Best of all, it's only two hours from Mexico City in a car, on a world class highway.
