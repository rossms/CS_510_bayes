The chaste life of the devoutly religious Jane Eyre, who becomes molded into a sort of nun by wicked childhood institutions, shows how horrible and repressing life can be once rules and militaristic order replaces inclinations towards fun and playfulness. Like most kids, Jane wants to live a normal, playful life but religious school institutionalizes her to believe that a life devoted to God demands unending pain and mirthless acivities. This story is a good example of the heavy burden the rules of religion can place on a child's mind, before it has ever had a chance to try and figure life out on its own.
