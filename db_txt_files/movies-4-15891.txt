Excellent movie capturing the glitz and glamour of Las Vegas. I would have to agree with the person who said that Julia Roberts was a poor choice for the part of Tess, however. She just didn't seem to fit with George Clooney and Brad Pitt. She was elegant, enough, yes, but they needed someone with a little more spunk. The movie is very entertaining, though, overall, and there are admiration-worthy performances by all of the actors. A little bit slow in the beginning, perhaps, but by the middle it picks up and by the end you're hooked.
