twas a great read no doubt. A long one full of love triangles and mis acused murder. If your reading for the jist of it. The chapter the grand inquisetor is quite good. One of the best chapters i have ever read. Its about someone questioning weither or not we should have freedom. The inquisetor says no, and that there should be apointed leaders..its facinating.
