Every Ivy league or junior Ivy school I've visited has it's share of weirdo's. But they are intelligent people and they don't bother anyone; I'd feel a lot safer on brown's campus than on the typical state university. Brown's a beautiful school and obviously the education is fantastic. Providence used to be considered a dump but about a decade ago the city went through a serious rebuilding process and is now on several lists as one of the top 10 cities to live.
