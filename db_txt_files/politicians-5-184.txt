Dread King who reigned almighty and produced his lion whelp who defeated the whole flower of French nobility and foraged whilst the King looked on! Great King, most fammed of famous Kings. Tragically his victorious son, Edward, Black Prince of Wales did not outlive him. His Great Grandson, King Henry V triumped mightly, for he was a stem of that victorious stock.
