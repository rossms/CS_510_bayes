I think a strong case can be made for Martinez being the top pitcher of his era. He forces wins when his team is flat, he is as ferocious a competitor as there is, and his numbers speak for themselves. Understand, I'm not saying he is the top pitcher of his era (there's a lot of competition) but he's well in the running.
