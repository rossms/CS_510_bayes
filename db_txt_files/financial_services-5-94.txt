I was a little apprehensive when Firstar and USBank merged. Overall I am very pleased with the services offered. We still have the same personel at our local branch that we are comfortable dealing with. The fees are in line with other banks. But I am especially impressed with the online banking and internet billpay. The website is very user friendly. Every bank can have moments when mistakes are made, and USBank is good at correcting errors and offering their service guarantee when they are at fault.
