It's a very powerful yet very depressing film. Lindsay Lohan plays a young girl named Astrid who gets sent to many foster homes because her mother (Michelle Pfiffer) is a murderer in jail. I must say I never liked Rene Zellwegger, but she was great in this film as the tragically doomed actress Claire.
