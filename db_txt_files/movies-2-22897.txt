This movie, claiming to be based off Stephen King's short story of the same name, I believe, is incredibly weak. Arnold's performance is abysmal, even by his standards, and the plot is unconvincing. The action is minimal, and there's very little suspense to it. Overall, absolutely nothing to recommend this movie.
