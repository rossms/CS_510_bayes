he's one of the luckiest coach in NBA. having a very good resume after winning his first 6 titles (thanks to jordan and pippen), now he has Kobe and Shaq running for his 10th title. he's very clever in always putting himself at the good team to win championships. I'm not sure though how well he can do if he coach the current BULLS (2004 rosters). (by the way notes for PBeavr, spelling michael JORDON; is that a joke ?)
