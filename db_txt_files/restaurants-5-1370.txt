One of IJR's favorite places to stop for a quick bite. What can be better than ordering your food from your car, and having it delivered right to you, without wasting gas while waiting in a drive thru? Nice variety, good prices, and the best hamburgers around. All with a classic 1950's feel without puonding the themed-atmosphere down your throat. Great!!
