I definitely grew up with Sears. My Santa's wish list was always browsing their huge catalog and making circles around my exaggerated number of selections (typical on little kids). Now that I am a mommy I have to hide it from my kids! But I need to say that their children's and women's department are terrific. And the not so old Pier One section is my favorite.
