Copenhagen Long Cut and a beer is the best way to unwind after the BS of a longday. I like the flavor of the tobacco. I've tried Kodiak and skoal they don't cut it. If I wanted mint or berry flavors I'd be be chewin on gum or candy. Cope in my neck of the woods costs 7 bucks a can, worth it though. Copenhagen Long cut gets my vote every time. If I can't find Long Cut Snuff is the only other option.
