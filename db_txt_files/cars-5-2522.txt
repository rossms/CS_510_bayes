Dollar for dollar, mile for mile, the most fun car I've ever driven! Take the targa top off or not, and head for the beach (c'mon spring!)...drives like a dream, looks good, sounds good, makes you feel good, and you still have enough paycheck left to keep it on the road. There! a car that just earned its rating!
