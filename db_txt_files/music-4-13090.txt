I love Sisqo.I think some of these peoples opinions are wrong!Unleash the dragon is a bomb cd.Sisqo is good with or without Dru Hill!I think he has his own unique style,he doesn't like K-Ci JoJo at all.K-Ci JoJo ain't got nothing on him!There are so many people out there hating on Sisqo for no reason,he's a great singer and he's fine as hell...What more can you ask for?
