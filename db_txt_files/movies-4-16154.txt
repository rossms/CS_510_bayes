How often can you find amovie these days that's rated G? And you'll like it. Dennis Quaid comes across as a real baseball player. No kidding - the guy's got an arm. The high school stuff is a little melodramatic, but it's based on a true story and it's a way to get some real emotion into the movie. All in all, it's a feel good picture where a good man grows up to live his boyhood dream. It's worth seeing for everyone from ages 4 to 104.
