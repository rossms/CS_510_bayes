Norway is a lovely country - independent and beautiful. I've only been there once (to Voss) but I found it restful, healthy and gorgeous to look at and experience. In response to Eric's comment - Well done to Norway for not being dragged into the (fascist) European Union - a truly terrible monolithic organisation which no true democrat can stomach belonging to.
