The first time I really saw his acting was in American Beauty (I knew who he was, but I never really paid any attention to him). I can only say one thing: He's one of the best actors in hollywood. The thing is that I really don't rate him with 5 stars, because his role in the movie was so convincing that it got me depressed.
