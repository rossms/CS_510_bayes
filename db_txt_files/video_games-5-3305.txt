I see absolutely nothing wrong with this game. Of all of the RPGs I've ever played, not one of them has a better story line than FF7. Although it deviates from the traditional FFs a little, it's features such as materia make the game more complex and more fun. Sephiroth is a great villain, although his plots are somewhat confusing. I have no complaints about this game.
