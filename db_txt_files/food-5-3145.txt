there is only one store within a 50 mile radius of my house that i've found these things at. i really wish they were a little easier to find. people seem to have this idea that vegetarian cuisine is all just salads and soup, but this brand has some really great alternatives that are easy to just grab on your way out the door. i think that the vegetable pie and pie pockets are the best.
