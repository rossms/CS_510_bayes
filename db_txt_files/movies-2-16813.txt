There were lots of things to like about it. But it had two enormous flaws: (1) it's not believable that the man would think someone was his long-lost son when it wasn't his son at all. Such a resemblance between non-relatives would not be possible. (2) this was another of those tiring anti-McCarthy era movies. Communism is dead. The Left Coast just needs to accept it. Give us some movies without politics being shoe-horned in all the time. And quit constantly making it look like America was backward during the 1950s.
