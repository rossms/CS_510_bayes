For a frozen pizza this is great!Tastes better than most,you can taste the itialan flavors like a pizzeria! Freshetta sucks,if you like that then you'll eat most junk pizza.Not alot of dough either like most use too much and less on toppings.DiGiorno is flat for pizza.You need pizza taste buds to be able to tell the REAL flavors.
