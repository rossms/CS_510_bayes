Who is greater than Magic. Many will say Jordan. Here is why I say Magic. He could do the one thing that no other player in NBA history could do - I repeat no other player could do, and that is go to the Hall of Fame from any position in the NBA. Sorry Bird & Jordan fans. Also, name one group of players that Jordan beat for a championship that were so great that they went on to win a championship themselves? Jordan was the best for Sports Center but Magic was simply the best.
