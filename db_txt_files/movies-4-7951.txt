The premise is unique. I don't know of any other movie that dealt with the idea of living the same day over and over agian. The movie is entertaining and uplifting. The guy started out self centered but had a change of heart. If only we did have the same day to live over again. What could we accomplish? Guess what - you really do always have tomorrow!
