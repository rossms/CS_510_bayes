It is not easy to listen to a man who butchers the English language like this man does. His foreign policy is hypocritical and has caused rampant anti US sentiment around the world. He has done harm to the economy and brough discredit to his position. The only reason for not giving him one star is that he may ultimately create more stability in the Middle East for the next president to work from, but take the short term bad reputation for bad foreign policy with him personally when he leaves the White House.
