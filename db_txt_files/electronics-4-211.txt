Sony D Series portable CD players are very convenient. You can put them in your pocket and rock away. Sometimes they do tend to skip, depending on what you are doing at a particular time. They are a very good brand, and the case of the portable CD player is even cute looking. I own one of these CD players and they last a longtime. The warranty of this CD player is very good. Everyone should get one.
