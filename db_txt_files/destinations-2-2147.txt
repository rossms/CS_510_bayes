I understand why South Korea is angry with the United States. The accidental death of two teenage girls, Winter Olympics, etc. But they forgot about the Korean War. IF these ingrates hate us, I think we should let them deal with the Evil dictator alone. Why should we risk American lives for a country that despise us?
