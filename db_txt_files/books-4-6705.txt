This is an excellent book that deserves a rating better than good but not quite outstanding. The story of Ender and his training to battle the aliens is very captivating, with the war room scenes being very creative. I enjoyed the tale of a young outsider being trained to be a leader and the way the story progresses to an interesting ending is very good. Contains good charecterization and Card is an excellent storyteller, just didn't have the magic for me that makes me want to go back and reread it, which is my basis for a book or series being outstanding.
