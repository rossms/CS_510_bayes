At first I wasn't sure if I was going to like this one, but by the end I did. Like most Tim Burton movies, the plot is a little secondary, but the visuals are very good. It's been unfairly compared to The Wizard of Oz, so if you go into this one thinking it's gonna be that good you're going to be disappointed.
