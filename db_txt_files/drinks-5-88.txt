It is sad to admit this but I had never tried Guinness until recently. I always said that it was too dark and I didn't like it, yet I had never tried it. I think the color was intimidating as well as the calories but recently I was forced to admit that I hadn't actually tried it therefore forced to take a sip. Well, once I took a sip, I understood what all the hype is about. My god, this beer is delicious. A creamy, bitter, smooth combo that I couldn't put down. I eventually finished the Guinness that wasn't mine because I couldn't believe how good it was. It was so good, who cares about the calories?
