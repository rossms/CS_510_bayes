I'm not sure if this really can be considered a drama, but rather a suspense/thriller. Nevertheless, The Juror was quite good. Alec Baldwin gives a chilling performance as The Teacher , who has threatened to kill juror Demi Moore and her son if she does not sway the jury into voting not guilty in a major murder trial. Espescially chilling is the scene where Alec Baldwin is driving the car, threatening to run it off the road. The Juror will keep you on the end of your seat from start to finish, and I reccomend it to anyone who is in the mood for a good suspenseful movie.
