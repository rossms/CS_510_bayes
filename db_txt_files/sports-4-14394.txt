Having lived in Miami for several years, I started to heard stories about the local sports celebrities, including Marino. What I heard about Marino did not make me admire him very much off the field. Supposedly he is a private person to the point of being nasty if ever approached, and refused to share one bit of himself with the community. That is fine - that is his choice, but it still keeps me from giving him a 5 (that is my choice).
