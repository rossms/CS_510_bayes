Well the taste of this drink is great, however it tends to diagree with me in the morning. I mean if you want to get totally wasted, this is the drink. Also don't everybody love it when they get a hangover complete with a headache, vomiting and everything else that makes a hangover sooooo fun...thats the only disadvantage of vodka. It comes on fast, and kills you the next day.
