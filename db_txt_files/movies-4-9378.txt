 Legally Blonde is absolutely mindless and ridiculous, and I enjoyed it. Reese Witherspoon is great as Elle, a froufrou college student who decides to follow the boyfriend who dumped her to Harvard Law School. Elle actually enrolls as a student, and the movie follows her as she deals with a series of absurd situations both in and out of the classroom. This movie reminded me a lot of Clueless. If you can relax and go with the flow, you'll probably get a kick out of Legally Blonde.
