Not the best actor, but seems like a pretty good guy. I also give him points for his performance in Three Men and a Baby. When you hear the premise of that movie, it sounds like it's going to be the worst thing in the world, but it actually turned out to be an entertaining film. Selleck did a good job delivering the They're ultra absorbent! line when he was defending his choice of diapers.
