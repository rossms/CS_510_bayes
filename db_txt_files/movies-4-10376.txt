A Bill Murry vehicle that was very funny. I think this was his first film. The film is about a summer camp and all the things that happen. Counselers trying to score with counselors and campers getting in trouble. The best gag through out the show is the camp leader always waking up in a different place. Their is a kid that the story concentrates on and it is mostly about him coming out of his shell a good movie but don't bother with any sequals.
