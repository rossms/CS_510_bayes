Although I've only been in Hot Topic two or three times, I've had very pleasant experiences. I don't usually go there for everyday clothes, it's usually for something specific. Like this Halloween I was looking for something specific to go with my costume and I went there to find it. The sales lady was VERY helpful and I found exactly what I was looking for. My visit was quick and I wasn't pressured into buying anything but what I was looking for. I'd definitely go there again.
