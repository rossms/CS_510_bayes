I have smoked Marlboro Menthol Lights all my life. It's the best, with just enough mint after taste to it (unlike Salem, which has wayyyy to much mint). The new full flavor Marlboro Menthol is just amazing, with a shorter filter and really cool looking box. I would give up smoking if they were to ever take Marlboro Menthols off the market!
