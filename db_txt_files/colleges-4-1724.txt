I'm an OSU grad, so I'm a bit biased. But whatever, a great school to do whatever it is your heart desires to do. Whether it's skipping class, studying like mad, doing keg stands, running a radio show, harrassing political candidates, making a name for yourself, or getting a job after school with a good employer. The school is balanced and has it all.
