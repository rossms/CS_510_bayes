I was very disappointed with this film. I was so anxious to see it when I first saw the previews, but after renting it, I could not forgive myself. The acting was horrible, and so was the plot. The movie simply rode on Rob Scheider's name, basically expecting him to carry the film. Even he could not carry this true disappointing movie.
