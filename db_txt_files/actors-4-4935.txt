c'mon ladies, is he really that hot? i'll bet he farts and spits and does all that other gross stuff that normal guys do! (okay so i'm jealous, but only slightly). he's a pretty good actor, but could i see his face on a few less magazines so i'm not constantly reminded that my girlfriend thinks he's the hottest man alive?
