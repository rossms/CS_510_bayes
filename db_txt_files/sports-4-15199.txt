Met this guy a few times when he comes to Hawaii for sportscard shows. Great person, very down-to-earth personality, nothing like your typical a$$hole-athlete-attitude. Great all-around player, should be know as one of the better RBs when he decides to hang it up. Hopefully they can get it together in Seattle.
