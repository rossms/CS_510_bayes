I do not want to hear this 'tax cuts for the rich' crap anymore. That is a damn lie. The rich hardly ever pay any taxes and that has been the case under both Republican AND Democrat administrations. The middle class pays the overwhelming bulk of taxes, the opposite of what the Dems say. The tax cut could save my family as much as $1,500 a year. Oh yeah, you liberals want quick fixes, not long term solutions. As for those of you who say the tax cut saves you only $20, you sound like you pay very low taxes indeed. If you ask me, I like this 'neocon'.
