I love her but her movie choices (at least in my opinion) leave a little to be desired. She was great in Speed, While You Were Sleeping, The Net (yes, The Net--she was believable as a techno nerd), Love Potion #9 (remember that?), and 28 Days. I didn't care much for many of her other movies, but she is usually good in them.
