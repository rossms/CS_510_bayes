Target is an awesome store...not your typical department store which carries the same old stuff. Lots of different items that you can only find in specialty stores. The employees are pleasant and knowledgeable and it is a great shopping experience...their prices aren't as low as WalMart, but the extra few pennies are worth not getting aggrivated!
