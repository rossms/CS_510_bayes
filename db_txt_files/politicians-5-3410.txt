Go G Dub! This Marines old boss is the man. Served while he and Bubba were in office and take G Dub over Bubba any day. Semper Fi! UPDATE: just because people can say Kerry for an opinion poll doesn't mean they will make it to the big vote in November. Eschew is right about the lazy people, and it is them Kerry will have to thank when he bombs this fall. UPDATE: Wow, I'm good. Look at that prediction kids. UPDATE: All the haters are just gonna have to live with him. Quit signing petitions and quit trying to change the will of the American People.
