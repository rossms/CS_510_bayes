Johnny Depp was excellent in this movie. I grew up loving Willy Wonka, it was and still is my favorite all time movie. I expected to be disappointed by the remake, but was surprised when I truly enjoyed the movie. Though, I do see where people like Anna find some of the references to the children and such, rude and cruel. But, honestly, that was not really the focus for me or my children when watching it. I think most children will be driven to see the fantasy of living in a world of chocolate...I mean really, who wouldnt want to be own a chocolate factory??
