I own this game on the gamecube system, however they don't have this one to rate in the gamecube spot, so I will rate it here, I have played both Ps2 and Nintendo's version of this great game, and both are equally as good in the graphics and gameplay department... I bought this game at Meijer for $14.99 and happy about that..it's a very good game for the low price it has come down to....A real kick butt boxing game with all the extra's....This one is a winner.
