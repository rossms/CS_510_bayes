You People are all one sided. I love Abercrombie because I think there clothes are very cute and they fit me perfect. Sure maybe they aren't freakish peasent tops that are flashy and intersting to everybody, and maybe some people buy them for the brand name . But some people actually like the fit and style. Abercrombie isen't as cheap as Kmart but no one says you have to buy there clothes. So step off.
