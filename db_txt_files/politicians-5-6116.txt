The reason the Democrats don't want Ashcroft as Attorney General is they KNOW he will uphold the law and they are AFRAID he will find something against them and make them pay the cost for the illegal manuverings and cover-ups. I hope he doesn't let up on all the corruption that went along with the Clinton Administration. First thing he should do is find out why Jesse Jackson does not have to pay any income tax.
