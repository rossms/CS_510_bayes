I have read Ender's Game at least half-a-dozen times. It is a great book, from many aspects: morality, society, challenges of leadership, friendship, and so on. It also has great imagery! (Just wait until you get to the battle rooms, you'll know what I mean!). The second book in the trilogy ( Speaker for the Dead ; there are now 5 books in the trilogy, with the 6th coming out soon) is equally excellent. If you like Ender's Game, you'll also love Ender's Shadow. And, you'll also love going to www.philoticweb.net.
