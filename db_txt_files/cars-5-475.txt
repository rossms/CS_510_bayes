I have an 2000 YZ125 M1. Pros: It's very fast, makes great horsepower, light, razor sharp handling, comes stock with Excel rims, very reliable with correct air/fuel mixture and jetting. Cons: Stock levers suck, plastic could be more durable, stock seat is vinyl covered. Suggested aftermarket parts: oversize handlebars and upper triple clamps (Pro-taper or Tag), pipe and silencer (I recommend FMF), change shock/fork springs (unless you weigh '130-150lbs, then just dial in your clickers), ASV or hardened levers, and a gripper seat cover. A great bike overall, fantastic with some modifications.
