Norm Stewart (a.k.a. Stormin' Norman) spent 32 years at Missouri without a single Final Four appearance (and obviously no National Championships). To his credit, his Tigers were usually competitive (though only Kansas was an historically good conference opponent year after year during that time). The bottom line is that while Stewart would be a good coach on a complete list that includes as much of the bad with the good, in comparison with most on this list, his rating suffers, and he definitely should not be at the very top (where I found him when I posted my comment).
