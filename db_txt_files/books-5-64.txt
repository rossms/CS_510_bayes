This really does bring to life what it was like for the Jews during the holocaust as its a personal account. You really do feel like you are there with Anne and feeling what she does. Its more heartbreaking because she was a bright, sweet and innocent little girl who had the rest of her life infront of her. This book should stay on the reading list for school children as it is very educating and shows the strength of human spirit.
