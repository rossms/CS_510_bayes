Rasheed is a media darling. He hates the media, but they LOVE him! Go figure. His occasional flare-ups actually seem to help the Pistons.....He knows what he's doing, he's a smart cat. I don't know what he majored in at NC, but I wouldn't be suprised if it was psychology......Pistons are 3-0 going back to last years playoffs whenever the much maligned GauranSHEED is uttered. That speaks volumes to his ability to instill doubt and occasionally, shame into opponents minds. And THAT my friends is a mark of a true superstar! A hemp smokin', hip-hop loving madman, Rasheed is worthy of my highest accolades!
