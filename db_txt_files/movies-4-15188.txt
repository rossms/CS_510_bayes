I thought this was a good movie. I liked it that the horse was smaller than the norm and came from an unfortunate background but was able to overcome his obstacles through sheer determination. And I liked it that the horse-or working with the horse-seemed to heal the characters, who had unfortunate backgrounds themselves.
