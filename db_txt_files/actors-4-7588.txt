I was recently in down in Mexico City, and this guy is about as big as big can be. He has carried just about every Mexican movie of note for the past few years Y Tu Mama, Amores Perros, El Crimen de Padre Amaro, etc, and his career seems to be absolutely blowing up. I think he's a pretty good actor - even when I'm watching him without subtitles and struggling with the spanish slang, he can still carry scenes.
