I've only been to Canada twice and both times I've been there were quite enjoyable. There are all kinds of neat things to see and all kinds of different people were there enjoying the same interests and environment. If I lived there I would be proud to have all these tourists checking out my homeland. It's a place I would never grow bored of.
