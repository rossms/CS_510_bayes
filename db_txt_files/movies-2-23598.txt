Minority Report is a fairly standard action movie that isn't as thought provoking or important as it wants to be. There are definite holes in the plot as well as many surprise parts and big plot twist that you can see coming from miles away. This movie is very slick in its vision of the future and is worth seeing once but it really doesn't have anything to say that hasn't been said in a better way by a movie such as Blade Runner.
