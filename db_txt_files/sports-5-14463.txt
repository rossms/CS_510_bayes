As ferocious a linebacker who ever played, and perhaps the best at the position. He hit like Ehrlacher wishes he could, and was one of the few players, who really inspired fear in his opponents. I always figured that one day the Bears would be playing an evening game with a full moon in the sky, and Butkus would kill some running back. And eat him.
