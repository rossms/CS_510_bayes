Creed is one of the best groups today. They have such expression and soul-searching intertwined into their lyrics and music. The lead singer has such an enchanting voice, quite original and unique from other rock bands. This makes the group stand out so much more. I think the lyrics seem to apply to me and my own struggles. The mesmorizing vocals combined with the loud drumming and electric guitar make this a great CD for those who are at a confusing point in their life, or for those who just want to listen to some great music.
