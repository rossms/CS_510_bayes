This gin is hard to find, at least in Florida. I bought a bottle on a cruise ship ($26.95 duty free) which is pretty steep. I found the taste quite delightful. Does very well just straight with no additives. Let's hear it for the gin Martini! I'm beginning to think we're a dying breed in this crazy Vodka world.
