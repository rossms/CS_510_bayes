they rank right up there with skittles i love all the flavors. a friend of mine was hooked on buttered popcorn flavored ones and when they went closeout she panicked thinking that was the end of that candy so she bought all the rest that the store had in stock.i thought they didnt taste bad they just didnt taste right like trying to be something they werent. my friend didnt care hether i liked them it was more for her
