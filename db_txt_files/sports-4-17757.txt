I have been a fan for years & think Holmgren has finally built the team he has wanted for a long time. The rest of their season is easier than some teams, except for the Colts. I predict they will make it into the 2nd round of play-offs, at the very least if everyone can continue to stay healthy. Our receivers are much better, we finally have a great and cohesive offensive line to protect our QB, Hasselback is having a great season, and our defense is finally firing on all cylinders too!! Go Hawks!!
