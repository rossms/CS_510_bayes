A beautiful place to visit, amazing architechture, beaches, historical attractions, shops and an assortment of restaurants. If you are ever in Puerto Rico, I also suggest heading over to the other side of the island. We stayed in Rincon which is a gorgeous town with great little bars and cafes. A lot less touristy with great attractions like the lighthouses, unbelievable beaches and the everyday culture of the people.
