It was a movie, people! Yeah, it was far fetched, but so was The Matrix, yet people thought that was a great movie (me included). I thought the relationship between Cage and Travolta was riviting. You could feel the hate between them and that is what acting is all about. I thought is was thought out well and as for being the best movie, I don't think so.
