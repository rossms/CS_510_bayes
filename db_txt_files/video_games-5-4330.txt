An engaging game that requires only a little effort to manage. Some games go overboard on controls and sub menus but this game found a decent balance. The actual method by which power-ups is done could have been better but the game has an excellent story and a good flow. Novice RPG gamers might have a difficult time at first but can be used as a game to get your feet wet.
