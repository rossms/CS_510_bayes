I love it if i am on a road trip, or on a plan. But thats the only time i play it. Its fun and all but i have other systems at home that i am dedicated to. I still like it because it kills alot of boardum on a long trip. Dont buy it just to buy it. Buy it if you travel alot. If you dont then Get an x-box, ps2, or game cube.
