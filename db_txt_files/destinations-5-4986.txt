Maine is a very nice place to raise a family, retire or get away from the rat race. The coastal areas are especially nice- with sea breezes and idealic towns. Lots of woods, pretty beach side resorts (to mid coast) And the famous rocky coast in down east Maine. Pro envirionment, ANTI corporate and pro people.
