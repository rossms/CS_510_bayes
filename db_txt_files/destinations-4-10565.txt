If you MUST buy a cigarette from the Phillip Morris Tobacco Company..this is the only one I would recommend, even though Phillip Morris still won't care about you or your rights. Parliament is probably the only regular cigarette(non menthol) that I actually enjoy on occassion...and suprisingly PM puts these on sale quite often. Not too bad...however, I will never smoke them again until Phillip Morris starts defending its own customers !
