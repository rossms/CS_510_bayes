Our company has 3 2004 model grizzly 660's. All the front drive shafts have failed within 1500km/300 hours and Yamaha have to get parts from Japan which takes weeks. The fuel still boils in the tank. The exhausts all started rattling within six weeks. One burns 250ml of oil a day and blows white smoke.
