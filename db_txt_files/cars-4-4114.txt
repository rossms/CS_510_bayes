It looks small on the out side but has plenty of leg and head room in the front. The back is suitable for shorter trips for passangers, but I would not travel accross the states with rear passangers. The rag top is surprisingly quiet in comparrison. It is a fun vehicle to own and operate. Drive defensively and don't be stupid! It is great on gas milage and you can park it easily even in tight parking. Great sound system and the 2.0 litet engine gives you plenty of get up and go. I suggest it to all fols who want the pleasures of an SUV for $20,000 or less
