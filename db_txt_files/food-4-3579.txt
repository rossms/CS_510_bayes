GSTM's(Girl Scout Thin Mints) are alright I suppose but there is a cheaper alternative. The type Thin Mints (TM's as we call them) you can purchase at one of the chain drug or convenience stores for $.99 - 3.25 for the deluxe variety. I have a dear Friend who helped me relive my childhood thin mint (oops ... TM) memories when we were in college -- Hey JD!!!! LOve you M'am! We are huge TM fans! Toss in a cup of hot cocoa (HC for those in the know) and you've got the perfect post Snow Bowl or winter evening snack! Go TM's!!!! T. HOuse
