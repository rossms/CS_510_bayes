Twix, a dependable favorite. I'm glad they brought the peanut butter version back....I inhale those things. The original caramel isn't too bad either. I used to eat the chocolate and the caramel off the cookie and then eat the cookie last. Sounds messy, but I always wondered what the cookie tasted like without the chocolate on it.
