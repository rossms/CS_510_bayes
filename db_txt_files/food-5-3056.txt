My husband & I first discovered Mystic Mints on our honeymoon. We got them at a small market in the redwood forest and enjoyed them in our tent. For the past 26 years they have been an anniversary tradition for us. We're quite disappointed that we can't find the originals anymore. There's something special about that mystical name :-) At least we can substitute the fudge mint Oreos.
