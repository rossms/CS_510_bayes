Come on! who of Us hasn't as a kid had that deep seated fear of the dark? Just imagine if it turned out to be justified! Movie wasn't the BEST but it was typical good Saturday, got some time to kill let's go to a movie fare...Just loved the scene with the kid under the blanket with the flashlight...that brought back childhood memories of waking up from a nightmare...
