I have a 1993 SE 5 speed and just purchased a 2001 SE Anniversary Edition 5 spd. I love the ride and handling of the '93; the '01 is taking some getting used to with the larger wheels and low profile tires. Other than that, the car is awesome...strong engine, great handling, great interior comfort, and I love the styling. I'm a Maxima man to the core...have been for 14 years.
