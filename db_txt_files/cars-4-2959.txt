People, if you're smart enough to know that the G20 isn't really a sports car then why do you judge it as such? Look at the G20 for what it is: an affordable, entry level Infiniti. The G20 is the baby of Infiniti's line-up and can most likely be compared to the Acura 1.6/1.7 EL (sold in Canada only) which is basically a tarted up Honda Civic. Most definitely the G20 needs more horses for it's price and Infiniti might be wise to offer a V6 for future renditions. For an Infiniti though, the G20 is quite relatively inexpensive.
