Giambi is a true breath of fresh air. He looks like he should be a bad professional wrestler (tatoos and long hair), but instead is one of the best hitters in baseball and should probably win the AL MVP. He hits for both power and average and is a decent fielder at first base. I've also heard him on the Dan Patrick Radio Show and he is funny and comes across as a regular guy.
