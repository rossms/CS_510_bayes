Brett is an amazing Quarterback. He is throwing as well as he ever has in his career. Now that he finally has a few receivers to throw to you'll see huge numbers. Even when he was throwing to no-name receivers, he made them look like pro-bowlers. He simply makes everyone around him great. Stick him with some already great receivers and you'd see ridiculous numbers. Plus he just makes the game fun to watch. He's like a kid out there. As long as he doesn't retire anytime soon, he will smash records
