I never read a Koontz book before. I really struggled to get through the 600+ pages. The characters were too one-dimensional. They were either really good or really evil. The good characters were so formula. Really, I gagged a few times. Also, Koontz much have spent years trying to figure out how to end this story and it appears he never came up with anything that really worked well. Im sure I wont read another of his works.
