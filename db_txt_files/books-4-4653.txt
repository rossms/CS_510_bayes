For me, it was difficult to read, because it has a lot of big words (which you don't have to let intimidate you!). But I'm just slow... :) It is such a good book, though, with a really creative plot. If you can correctly guess the ending before you get there, you must be psychic; it was a big surprise to me and everyone else I know who read it. du Maurier's characters are created with such authenticity. Great book.
