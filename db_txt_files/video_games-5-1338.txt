I think this is one of the best game boy advance games I have ever played. The best part abou this video game is that there are new tracks and new drivers to pick from. Another good thing about this game is that you can hook up to three other gam boy advances and race bumper to bumper with your friends. An exclusive feature on this game is ghost exchange which is very cool. I would reccomend this game to anyone who likes racing games and to anyone who likes Mario a lot.
