Okay, once you have had a belmont every other cigarettes is awful...honestly thats how good they are! The Smoothest best tasting all natural cigarettes ever! the only bad/good thing is that they are additive free cigarettes so they have a shorter shelf life!... but if you buy a pack I guaruntee they will be gone before they are bad...just make sure to buy them from a bigger chain like a gas station, 711, or Macs Milk...anyways BELMONTS ARE THE BEST when cigarettes are this good its a sin to quit! although smoking is BAD! for your health...life is about living not about health and longevity!
