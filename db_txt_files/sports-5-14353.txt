Even today, Marino could outgun most of the current NFL QB's. Marino had to leave because while never fast, he at least had good footwork and could move in the pocket. When his speed went from near zero to absolutely stationary teams just started teeing off on him and blitzing every down. It was sad to watch the last few years.. and a big reason I think coaches today are so obsessed with QB's who can run and gun like Michael Vick
