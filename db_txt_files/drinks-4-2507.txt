A good sparkeling wine (champange) especially the extra dry which is not that hard to find. At around $12 to $14 a bottle this is a great champange for large parties and quite evenings at home. In my opinion the best california champagne under $15. Great for weddings and aniversary parties where price is an issue. I would recommend steping up to Veuve Clicquot Brut Yellow Label for smaller gatherings under 8 people if you can find it around $25 or Gloria Ferrer for around $18 to $20.
