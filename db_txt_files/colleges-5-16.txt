Temple University and the Fox School are doing a great job at enforcing the academic standards and reputation of Temple. The Fox School has the highest alumni participation rate at the university and the job placement rate is also very high. Students with a degree from Fox come out making just as much as anyone who went to an Ivy League grade-inflated label of a university, and the education is affordable and has more value. Fox is definitely one of the best in the world.
