Duh, wake up and smell the coffee. I agree with Ollie. Reagan will go down as the BEST president of the 20th century. Did you catch the Reagan birthday edition of his show? This guy brought down communism, didn't take crap from the air traffic controller union, grew the economy and made us into the SINGLE MOST POWERFUL and RICHEST COUNTRY IN HISTORY!
