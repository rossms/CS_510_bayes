When I passed through Chicago, I thought of it as just a huge midwestern city. As in midwestern, I mean tons of decay, dysfunctional neighborhoods and segregation. Chicago despite being four times bigger seems to have less than Denver, Colorado. Chicago isnt a city, its just 100 miles of sprawl in each direction to even more depressing cities like Fort Wayne, Davenport, Milwaukee and Kankakee.
