Choosing Nancy Pelosi as minority leader is one of the few intelligent things the Democrats have done in the past 25 years. Some people bash her as being too leftist but, I ask, isn't that what the Democratic Party should be all about? If I wanted to support conservatives, I'd be a Republican. I am completely sick of what is supposed to be America's progressive party aping the Fascists and right-wing religious whackos of the GOP to get votes. It's time for the Democrats to start offering a clear alternative to the Bushoids and Nancy Pelosi is a promising start. I just hope the trend continues....
