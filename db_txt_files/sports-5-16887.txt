Between New England, Pittsburgh, and Indianapolis there are three very strong teams in the AFC. There are others but these three are the best. New England has the experience. That counts for a lot. Pittsburgh has some experience and Indianapolis the best QB. A toss up. New England should still be the favorite. Results are what count most and the past few years they have the results others lack.
