Toontown is an awesome game! It's worth paying for. You get to interact with other players, do Tasks and go to playgrounds that are magical and cartoony! And soon, we'd be able to drive around in a new playground, Goofy Speedway. There are many fan sites, and lots of people in them! I for one, can't get enough of the Massivly Multiplayer Online Role Playing game of Toontown. :) (P.S. Hey, LLP!)
