The Reverand Jesse Jackson is nothing but a blubbering idiot, always trying to find some way to have an issue be race related. In the latest issue he has had would be involving the hiring of Don Schula as the football coach for Alabama. Somehow this moron turned it into a race related issue because there was a black coach who was more qualified. All i have to say is WHO CARES this guy is an idiot and i have no idea why anybody thinks he is a leader of any sort.
