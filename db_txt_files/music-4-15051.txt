The CD Tranceport by Paul Oakenfold is a very good CD because through every track, it flows very smoothly. All the tracks are good too. There are build ups and breaks in the CD/album, but it's still smooth. There aren't any hard beats at any point and that's why it isn't a 5. Other than that, I'd buy this CD.
