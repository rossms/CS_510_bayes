I wonder what idiots put this team way down here. WVU is one of the best teams in the country. Don't you remember when they beat ranked Virginia Tech? Don't you remember when they almost shocked Miami? They are the only team outside the top ten (they're at 11 by the way) who has a shot at the championship. I've even heard one analyst say they'll go undefeated. They won't be undefeated, but they'll come close.
