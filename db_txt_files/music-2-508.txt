What a disappointment! Formerly incredible musicians/showmen show their age. To come in eight short years from genius (Blood, Sugar, Sex, Magik)to watered down pop brings to mind Aerosmith's fall from grace. The Chili Peppers should either renew their heroine addictions and their bi-sexual love lives or call it quits. They are wasting John Fruscionte's talent.
