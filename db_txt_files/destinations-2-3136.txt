Toronto. The good - cultural diversity, tolerance, clean, easy to navigate, range of restaurants and entertainment options. Toronto. The bad - dull, pretentious, very unfriendly and cold people (for comparison, New Yorkers are much more friendlier and open), self absorbed, severely lacking in character, a nightlife that is all but asleep by 3am.
