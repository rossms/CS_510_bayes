Dani, that's called skiptracing and that's because you didn't call the company back about the bill you owed them, they have every legal right to try to contact you through whatever means necessary if they're not a collection agency, if you would've paid your bill they wouldn't have had to call you at all. Or if you would've returned their calls/letters/bills. Or if you would've left a VALID contact #.
