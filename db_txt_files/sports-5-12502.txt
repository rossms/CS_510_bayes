This team has truly performed a miracle! People forget that the NCAA almost killed this program with 3 years of sanctions, losing between 25-30 scholarships. People may call the last 3-4 years disappointing , but I call them HIGHLY SUCCESSFUL all things considered. Thanks Butch for saving our great program.
