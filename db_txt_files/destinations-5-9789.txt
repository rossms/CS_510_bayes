Kamel Red Lights have been my little friends for 3 years now. I would never go back to anything else. Even though they may kill me, every last one of them is worth it. Rumor has it they are not producing KRL's anymore. Someone please tell me it isn't true! KRL's are the best. And hard to find in my little state!
