St. Georges is beautiful with interesting historical landmarks such as old stone army forts from the 1800s. If you go to Bermuda it makes a nice day trip. Bermuda is a great place to go if you want to relax. Just be warned that it's a lot further North than the other islands so if you go during the winter or early March like I did you will definitely need a coat
