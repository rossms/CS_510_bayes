He throws a nice ball, but doesn't seem to be especially accurate. Seems to fumble quite a bit. Most damningly, down the stretch against Kansas City, it looked like he got really rattled - and yes, that was against the uhhh vaunted Kansas City Defense. Wait until he sees Jevon and the Eagles blitzing secondary.. he may have a heart attack.
