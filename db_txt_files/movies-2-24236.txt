Great CG and . . . well, great CG. That's pretty much about it. I didn't know what to expect except a pissed off Jolly Green Giant on steriods, and that's pretty much all you get. The movie was pretty tedious, and though the comic-book style frames within the picture were cute , it was also very distracting and got old fast. To its credit, though, the Hulk vs. the dogs was a great sequence.
