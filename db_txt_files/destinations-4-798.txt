Big and beautiful country...some places seemed like I was transported to the forties and there is a strange stillness in the air. Friendly (except Montreal I hear) and fun. I felt healthier after a visit here. As for politics, way to go CANADA! No wonder it regularly scores high on the best places to live...if a little remote.
