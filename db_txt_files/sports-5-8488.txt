There's no I in team or Kobe but he couldn't care less - this is what he's wanted all along, to be a one-man scoring machine. Pouring in 81 points last Sunday, and with a 35ppg average at this point that seems to be going nowhere but up. And he got Coach Phil Jackson to come back and attempt to ride the Kobe train straight back to another few championships. Call me anything but a Kobe Bryant fan, but I can't argue that the guy is just nasty.
