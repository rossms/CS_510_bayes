Good web browser. Despite the hype one must understand the differences between Mozilla and Firefox. Firefox has no e-mail capability (that componenet is called Thunderbird), Mozilla has it integrated in. Thus, Firefox is not your best pick for a home web broswer, use it in business environments where an enterprise e-mail software provides e-mail capailities, thus the e-mail is not necessary. In this environment Firefox is a better choice given its smaller foot print then Mozilla.
