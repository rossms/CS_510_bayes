Too far away for me to visit. Too darned cold in the winter and spring, despite the Gulf Stream around Anchorage and the Kenai Peninsula. Breathtakingly beautiful state, though. If I could somehow cross the continent from New York, I would go to see the glaciers and the indigenous Native populations. Too expensive to live there. Don't feel like living half my life in seaplanes and waiting six months for my next shipment of Van de Kamp's Pork and Beans to be flown in. Too Republican. I do admire the native Alaskans wanting to be left alone. I can respect that, and so I will leave this state alone.
