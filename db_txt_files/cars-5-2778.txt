The Toyota Celicas are grossly under rated. It is one of the most reliable cars that I have ever owned. I have owned Ford, Nissan, GM and numerous Toyotas, including supras. I bought an 84 Celica when I first got my license (at age of 16), I am now 26 and own 3 different Celicas. I have a 76 GT, 87 GT and 89 all-trac. I enjoy them all, each one is pleasurable to drive in their own ways. I have yet driven a sports car that I enjoyed as much as the Celica all-trac.
