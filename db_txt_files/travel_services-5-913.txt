These guys were great! They worked quickly and effeciently. Polite, well dressed, clean cut, and very well mannered. They took care of my furniture and were very organized. The office staff was wonderful! I was sent a letter confirming my upcoming move and received a phone call as well. Included in my letter were helpful hints on saving money and some moving tips! The Two Men and a Truck in Tuscaloosa, Alabama is a FIVE STAR company! Thanks!
