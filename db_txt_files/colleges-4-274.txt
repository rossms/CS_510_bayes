I am in my forth course of MBA Marketing at U o P. I spend on average 30-35 hours per week to do all of my assignments & readings. It is DEFINITELY NOT an easy degree. I am wondering, where is this information coming from that everybody can get an A without putting in the work??? Certainly not in the classes that I've been taking so far. I do not enjoy the team environament, however, this is what real life is. Some people do more & some people do less, I guess this is a preparation for the real world.
