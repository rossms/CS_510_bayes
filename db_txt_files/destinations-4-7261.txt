Being Scottish and in Scotland, I really like Edinburgh. It has lovely architecture, interesting things to do, good shopping, the Festival is great. And the Hogmanay celebrations...! But, being originally Glaswegian(i.e. from Glasgow), I don't think I could ever really love it the way I love my home city... :-)
