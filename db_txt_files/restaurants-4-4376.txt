Good menu selection, good food and a variety of it. If you like good country cooking this is the place to go. Also has a store up front which is neat. Usually is always crowded on the weekends, breakfast, lunch and dinner hours. Buses love to come to Cracker Barrel so choose your time to eat wisely.
