Adam Sandler is a really funny guy and this movie is funny at times. I am torn to give it a 3 or a 4. Some parts get a 4 and some get a 3. He plays the town idiot in one of his retarded voices which is funny, especially if you see it more than once. Henry Winkler (The Fonz) is so funny. He has this one line while in high heels and he says, I hate it, I hate it, I hate it and it cracks me up everytime. This is no Billy Madison or Happy Gilmore but it is still up there as a good Adam Sandler movie.
