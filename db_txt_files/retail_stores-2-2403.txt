The Farmer Jack store in Orchard Center, Holland, Ohio is substandard. Although the store is clean, customer service is horrible. While attempting to get cash from the ATM, the machine malfunctioned, shorting us $20. When we informed management, the first response was basically sucks to be you, not our problem. Upon further pressing them for assistance, the store manager said she would take our number and call the ATM bank and inform them of the problem and they would call us. 6 hours later and still no phone call!
