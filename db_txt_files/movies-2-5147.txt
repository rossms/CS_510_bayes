It's not really an adaption of the book, the book is much different, and it's pretty damn awful. I didn't like it, it's quite boring at times. I don't have any complaints other than the fact that, in the end, it just wasn't that enjoyable. Just my two cents. Summary: A BAD FILM. NOT WORTH SEEING. NOT A COMPLETE STINKER THOUGH.
