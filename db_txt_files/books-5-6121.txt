Mr. Schlosser has written an insightful book that was well researched and documented. Hopefully, it might bring to the fast food industry the same exposure that Upton Sinclairs The Jungle brought to the deplorable conditions of the meat packing industry. I have loaned my copy out so often that the pages are now dog-eared. Definitely makes one think twice before driving up to the squawk box to order a pound of fat with a side of salt. Thats super sized please!
