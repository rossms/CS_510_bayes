I love it. Fixed rate, unlimited minutes. It does have limited coverage, but for us we just use it here in the SF Bay Area, we don't travel much. Re calls being dropped, maybe just a bit more sensitive than other services, I can deal with it. longest I had to wait for a message was maybe 2 hrs. So Overall, I like it! Sure beats waiting for the bill to come in with some wild amount due.
