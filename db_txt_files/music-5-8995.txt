i love outkast. so fresh in so clean is such a fun song. the video is really cool too. captures the song well(exept for ludacris being in it)outkast's name fits them so well. they don't deserve to be categorized with all these sh*tty rappers in the game now. i don't really listen to rap, but i love outkast. i can't wait until they release their own fashion line!
