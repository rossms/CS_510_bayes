As a company, Coke has been having a tough year or two. But the drink is now and will always be the king. Pepsi is a too-sweet wanna-be. What other drink (or consumer product, for that matter) could have sparked a national crisis by announcing a small change in its formula? It's pretty interesting that sugar water, backed by expert marketing, can inspire such loyalty and emotion.
