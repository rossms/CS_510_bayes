A wondeful country, but as any other, you should search for a good travel agency. There are many different attractions, not only on carnival, the beachs are great, try the south on Florianopolis, or northeast like Natal or Salvador to get out the traditional travel routes. That doesn't implicate you shouldn't go to Rio or Sao Paulo, that's just alternate trips. Another nice place to admire nature is Igua√ßu Falls, a incredible place, take a time to visit Itaipu, the greatest hidreletric on the world. The most important and please don't forget: the language spoken is PORTUGUESE, NOT spanish!
