Oringinally, I had given Gephardt a 5 rating because he always seemed principled. But him, like Lieberman, have prostituted themselves for their own political gain. Gephardt refused to acknowledge that Gore is wrong in continuing this joke of a hand-count in Florida. Plus, he is one of the few Democrats who are still protectionist. Beware if he makes it to the White House; our economy will spin out of control has a result of higher tarriffs in a Gephardt administration.
