I think Gattaca is one of those movies, like 2001, that is really really boring, but its developed a cult-like following of folks who love it no matter what. The truth is, this movie will put you to sleep in a minute. Hey, maybe that's why people give it a high rating, because they've never actually seen the wretched thing.
