Marshall Field might be a bit pricey but it's a part of chicago's history. It sells every product I can think of. Also it was the first store to have a restraunt that woman could eat at without a man. So if your looking for an intresting place to visit go to Marshall Field on State St. This store has so many things including a restraunt, viewing windows, almost all the clothes brands, kitchen supplies, and so much more. I hope you visit Marshall Field on State Street.
