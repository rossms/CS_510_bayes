The boiling bunny says it all, a symbolic message of infertility gives heroic Glenn Close way more power than the stereotypical sexual woman deserves. But some female power in a film is worth a look, as this kind of role comes around very rarelyy for Hollywoods female actors. This film is really irie and scary, but well worth your time. The visuals are outstanding.
