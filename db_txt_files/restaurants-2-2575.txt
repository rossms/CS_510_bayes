Have eaten at many McDonald's. Most are dirty and the staff seems to be a bunch of retards. However, when you find a clean one, run by squared away adults, it is very good! I really like the Number 1 when sitting in, and the number 2 when driving. We always go through the drive-threw and get a load of fries for the kids when on a long trip. They also have good cokes. The surup seems adjusted right. I do like their menu.
