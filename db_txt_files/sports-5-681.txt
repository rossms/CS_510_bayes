Okay I have been a Braves fan for I do not know how long and I have also been a Chipper Jones fan for the longest. I do believe that the third baseman is the most important player when it comes to strength and willness. I do belive that Chipper Jones has those two abilities and will continue to have those tow abilities beyond retirement. Chipper Jones is the best third basemen that I have seen in all of my years of watching professional baseball.
