I recently bought a 2001 Hyundai Sonata with the 4-cyl engine...and I couldn't be happier. It's not perfect; the engine accelerates a little loudly and the disc/drum brake combo is not the strongest. But I'm not taking this this car to Daytona, just to work and back. And for sheer value, it would be hard to beat even without that killer warranty of theirs. The warranty makes it a no-brainer. I chose the 4-banger for financial reasons; I may get the V-6 next time, depending on fuel prices.
