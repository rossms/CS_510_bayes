There is a sense of artistic self-importance and attitude among the great bands of the 90's, but S.P. really made an underrated double-album with this effort. Great college album with drug songs, mellowing-out-songs, make-out songs, pissed-off songs. . .really captures the feel and mood if you were a twentysomething moody jerk in the nineties. . .oh, that's right. . .that's me. . .
