raisin bran and I share a love/hate relationship. It is tasty, but sometimes I overdo it when I eat it. Just like alicat, I eat all the raisins out of the box, and then we are left with boxes of plain bran. My dad gets so aggrivated with me. Oh, SamIAm, totally gross story! That has nothing to do with raisin bran- your kid could've stuck anything up his nose till it started to rot! And one more thing- some of you people need to use a dictionary-- i can't believe how badly raisin has been mispelled!!
