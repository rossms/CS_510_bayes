The greatest album of all time (as VH-1 dubbed it a few years ago?) No. Not even the Beatles' best (my vote goes to the White Album). But this has its share of classics (like all Beatles albums). And John's She Said She Said and Tomorrow Never Knows....well, it was a sign of things to come. I can probably die without hearing Eleanor Rigby or Good Day Sunshine again, but who's complaining.
