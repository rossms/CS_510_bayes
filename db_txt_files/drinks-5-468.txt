At Maritas in Bryn Mawr, PA, I treated a friend suffering from what appears to be a terminal brain tumor to her first Dos Equis XX Amber with the traditional twist of lime. We were both delighted and she spent the next week having her son track down a case of the stuff. I don't know if it was the lime or the beer, but it was truly delicious and I will always remember the pleasure it gave my friend. It has become my beer.
