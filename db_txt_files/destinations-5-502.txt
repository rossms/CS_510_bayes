This was our third time visiting, it won't be our last. We discovered Windy's Watersports for snorkling. Windy and Rene are great, we spent the whole day out on the water. Also bought gear at their new shop!!Find out more on aruba4you.com. Piamento resturant also a treat. We have learned not to go downtown on Thurs. and Fri. when the ships come in. Amigo car rentals were economical. No need for a car for the whole time..use the buses. We also like the Petite Cafe, food served on hot marble... Amstel Bright(not Light) served with fresh lime...Great...
