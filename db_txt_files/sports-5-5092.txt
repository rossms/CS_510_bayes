Chamberlain's college career tends to get a little overshadowed by his pro career because of several reasons.. 1) he skipped a year 2) Kansas failed to win the title in 57 3) he didn't average 50 pts and 30 rebounds a game. Well the college game was a lot different than the NBA then (less so now), North Carolina was a hell of a team (undefeated don't forget), and Chamberlain was almost constantly double and triple teamed.. which much like shaq frustrated him and led him to leave college early.
