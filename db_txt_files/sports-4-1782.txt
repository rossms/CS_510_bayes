* LaRussa runs his playoff teams into the ground but so far has avoided killing off the Cardinals. I don't expect his team to perform well when his influence is what matters. Cardinal fans need to hope the players can overcome his coaching through raw ability against Boston. * LaRussa has never impressed. So many great teams and so little to show for it. Only Bobby Cox has a worse image as a playoff coach.
