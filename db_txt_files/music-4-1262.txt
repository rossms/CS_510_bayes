I'm sort of with mcspongeicus on this, although not quite as enthusiastic. It took me awhile to get into this group, but like any acquired taste, it was well worth the wait. I don't think they were nearly as good as The Velvet Underground, but for the late 70's they were definitely one of the stand-out groups in terms of creativity and quality. So far as I know, they only put out 2 albums before they disbanded. And, of course, the Mongolians who were listening to Billy Joel and Bruce Springsteen and the Eagles never heard of them.
