Akward at the begining but its just to build tension so you can relieve it with laughter. Some may complain that its not very original in its approch, but the plot isn't either. Steller and DeNiro play it out well and make it worth watching. For those more critical than myself I'd just like to say relax , get a life its just a movie. I think it was cute, had a nice ending and made me feel good. More than I can say for most serious movies I've seen lately.
