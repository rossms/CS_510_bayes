The service is terrible. There are 2 near my home and we went to one some years ago and bad service. Went to the other, bad service. Waited a couple of years and went again, bad service. They have 25 servers and they are all crummy. Food is pretty good, once you get it, but the price for what you get is not a good bargain that offsets the crappy service.
