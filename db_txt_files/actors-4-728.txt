Came to be identified with his somewhat bland All-American good-guy roles, but he was electrifying as psychopathic hood Tommy Udo in the classic "Kiss of Death." A young Crazy Joe Gallo in Brooklyn supposedly watched this movie obsessively and patterned his own antisocial behavior after that of Widmark's character. A creepy example of life imitating art, I suppose.
