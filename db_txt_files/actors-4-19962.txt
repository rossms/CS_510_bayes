Major Snugglebunny shows off rare physical gifts, polished dramatic and comedic skills, and a bright, bright future. Loses a point for being involved in too many trashy teen flicks with easy, paper-thin roles(I know What you Did Last Summer, Scooby-Doo, Simply Irresistable). Turned in a surprisingly sexy layered performance in Cruel Intentions (1 rare teen flick that actually worked), and has become one of the finest actors on tv. Lets just hope she begins to choose moore quality material before she becomes a parody of herself. Go Buffy go!!! :=8D
