This is a very good CD by two of the all-time greatest blues musicians. Clapton has always pointed to B.B. King as his hero, and they've played together often. But this is the first time the two of them have made it into the studio. I wish it would have happened 15-25 years ago, when they were both closer to their prime, but the result is still great. Riding With the King is full of solid blues music, so don't expect any of the drippy soft-pop Clapton put on his embarassing Pilgrim CD. If you're a fan of Clapton, King, or blues music in general, this CD is a great buy.
