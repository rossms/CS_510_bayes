Nothing of what I expected. The first movie was about Vegas, and the biggest casino theft ever orchastrated. The cast was fantastic. The sequel had the same all-star cast - with the addition of Catherine Zeta Jones and Bruce Willis (for a minute). It took place in Europe and again was about theft but had nothing to do with gambling. The movie was much more unique than the first - it seemed to be over-thought, over-directed, and over-analyzed and required you to think a little bit. Overall it was cool and worth checking out.
