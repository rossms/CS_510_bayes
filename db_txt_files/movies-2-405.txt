This is one of the only movies I have ever fallen asleep in. The begining, which is the most crucial part of a film, was very slow. The story seemed to be moving nowhere. Aside from the slow start it also introduced poor visuals. This movie was filled with unnecessary computer-based effects and looked unbelievably fake.
