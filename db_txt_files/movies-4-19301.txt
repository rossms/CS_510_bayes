Friday the 13th part 2 is ok horror movie of the Friday the 13th francise. Part one was better,But this time around Jason is killing the clounsers one by one. Good effects for it's days,now with the special effects like Jason X and Jason VS Freddy was very well done.But, this is 1982 when part 2 came out,The acting was better and the director was better,it's a little bloody,but not as much as the other friday The 13th movies. If you like a good scary suspense movie on a late night this will do it for you. Friday the 13th even had it's own TV series out in 1990's.
