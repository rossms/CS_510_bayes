Barry Sanders is a very good football player. He has all the moves on the field. He is so hard to catch and so fast on the outside corners. Barry Sanders played his whole NFL career on the Detroit Lions. He gets props for never trading or seeking out another team for more bucks. Overall, I think that Barry Sanders is one of the best football players without a ring. I wish he would come back and show these new players how to run.
