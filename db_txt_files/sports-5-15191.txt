To anyone who thinks Alexander is not good...your wrong. He has had 1600+ yards 2 seasons in a row. 1300+ for 5 seasons. 15+ tds for 5 seasons. 20+ for 2 seasons tying a record. And broke the total TD record for TD's in a season. How can he not be good. One of 7 people to have 1800+ yards in a season. Amazing! Also how can he be a jerk. He is the nicest guy. Very down to earth great in the community and activly involved in his church. Big deal he said coachs back stabbed him. Common 1 yard to go. Of course hand it to the greatest 1 yard back of all time. 1 star????? How can you give him that rating?
