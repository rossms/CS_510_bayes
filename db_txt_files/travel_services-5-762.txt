I used Advantage in Denver. They upgraded me from their lowest economy car to a PT Cruiser for no additional charge. It ran and looked like a brand new car. Took it up into the Rockies with no problems at all. No problems with the reservations or checking it in. No hidden charges. Everything was very positive.
