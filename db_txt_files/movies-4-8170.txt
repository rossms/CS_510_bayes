It's BLUE!!! THE GODDAMN PEN IS BLUUEE!! It makes me laugh just thinking back on this hilarious movie. Although it isn't meant to be taken seriously, the movie also says something about our society today. Jim Carrey is at his best in the physical comedy, though; the emotional scenes were played too far over-the-top.
