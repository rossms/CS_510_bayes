Have had 5 Jap bikes, and 3 Harleys. I really enjoyed the Jap bikes. I tried a Harley and fell in love! I think the guys badmouthing the Harley's are just jealous. They feel left out, or like they ride a cheap imitation. Jap bikes are cheap, and have a lot of fake (plastic chrome) Harley is the real deal! Also the Harley handles great. I have a 2003 Ultra. Had a Gold Wing. The Ultra is way better than the Wing. Harley's Rule!!! Don't be jealous. It's o.k. to drool though. Just not on my paint. Jeff.
