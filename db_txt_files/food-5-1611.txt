The first time I saw these I thought ho hum, just another run of the mill hard candy. NOT! These are probably the very best hard candies I have ever tasted. Very strong, distinctive and well defined flavors. They do have a kind of nasty habit of sticking to your teeth if you try to bite down, so you have to take your time and have patience with them. Flavor-wise though, they're tops. Each is so good, I can't even single out a favorite!
