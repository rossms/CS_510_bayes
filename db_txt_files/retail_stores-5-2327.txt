Shopping at any one of the A&P family of fine supermarkets, SuperFresh, A&P, Sav-a-center, Waldbaum's, Food Emporium, Food Basics, Food Barn, Ultra food and drug and Dominion is like a family reunion. The store managers are nuturing, making sure your shopping experience is delightful and pleasant. And the prices are good and the double coupon savings remarkable. This is the only chain I know that matches their specials with current coupon offerings. I have not lived a day not eating food from A&P. That makes me very happy.
