What could have been a great film was ruined by tarantino's sick mind.All style and no substance,it's not cool to knock this movie,but to me tarantino is like 'the emperor who wore no clothes'.He said in an interview if he wasn't a filmaker he would have been a lowlife crook.What a surprise!Anyone who takes this jerk seriously probably thinks Ed Wood was a genius as well.
