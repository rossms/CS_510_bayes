T mac has been one of the greatest offensive players lately (he even already surpassed his cousin on that category), the only thing that could stop him is only himself. it's just too bad to see 2004 season, he's just a victim of the salary cap in MAGIC for not being able to sign a good partner for him, THANKS TO GRANT HILL
