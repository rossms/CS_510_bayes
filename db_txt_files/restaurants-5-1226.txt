God himself came down to Earth and opened Dunkin' Donuts. These little rings or ovals of pure rapture and ecstacy. Rolled up into a sweet flavor that delights all senses. Glazed, Chocloate, Jelly, Creme, and yes... even coconut! Dunkin' Donuts has the best selection of wonder pastries the world has even known. Thank you Dunkin' Donuts... thank you. By the way... crystal sugar, grape jelly, donuts are the key to happiness. Thank you and always tip your waitress...
