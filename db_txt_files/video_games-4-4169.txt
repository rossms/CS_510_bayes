NFL Game Day 2000 (by Sony Computer Entertainment of America) is the king of football games and superior to all the others. On the PC, SCEA made this quite a unique game with the elements of Total Control Passing, which allows you to truly command the offense. This notable game also has incredible AC which can't be beat, but realistic none the less. Improve the graphics and this game will be the tops!
