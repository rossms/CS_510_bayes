Some of these ratings are quite funny. People actually gave Outback a bad rating because it didn't have any Vegan options, and the portions were too big. Its a steakhouse...it says it in the name...What do you expect. In my opinion Outback is the best of the sitdown casual dining chains. The quality of the food is superior to any Applebees, Bennigans, Chilis, or anything else. Granted...there may be long waits at many of the restaurants, but if you are in a rush, try some place else.
