I am from the Ozarks and I have to say I love MIssouri. I was born and raised here with plenty of great memories. This is all I know since I rarely been to any of the big cities, Springfield is as big as I go and it is even too big,I will admit weather changes every 5 miutes but if you love beautiful rolling hills, peice and quiet of country living, and lots of creeks and rivers like I do come on over. I don't know anywhere else and don't want to, This is home!!!
