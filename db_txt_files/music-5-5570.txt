Have you ever heard a CD that makes you want to start it all over even before you are finished? Well, this is it. Talk about hits, wow, with great songs like Hell's Bells , You shook me all night long and the title track Back in Black headlining this CD, you absolutely can't live without it. AC/DC's unique style is extremely evident, in probably their best hit of all time You Shook Me . Definitely need to get this if you are looking for classic rock.
