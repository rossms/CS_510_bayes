Cingluar provides some of the best cell phone plans available right now. Due to their constant satellite upgrading, they provide great phone reception. You can basically call from within any building, and you'll most likely get through. They do have to improve their customer service though. I've seen it in action. They understand the problems some customers have. Yet, they still usually cannot do anything about it without the option of buying new phones.
