We honeymooned at Couples and found it to be everything we expected and more. They have five resturants for dinner so there is always something you will enjoy. Also there are plenty of onsite and offsite excursions to take part in that you can not fit them all in in a week but don't feel guilty for not trying either because they are all included. And the service is great you get whaever you want when you want it. We will be returning in the future
