I had no problem with AT T untill I tried to drop them. I swithed to Sprint. About three months later I started getting a bill from them again. I tried calling, but getting a real person on the phone is nearly impossible. I emailed them about the problem and recieved a reply back saying I wouldn't get billed again. About two months later it started all over again.
