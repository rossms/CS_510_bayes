Very talented, funny guy. To me, he was the reason to watch Seinfeld, even though the show went downhill in its final years. Also thought he was funny in Shallow Hal. Unfortunately, he can't seem to find a niche in TV outside Seinfeld but that seems to be a curse that afflicts everyone that was on the show.
