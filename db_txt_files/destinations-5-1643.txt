Austria is a beautifully scenic country. Vienna is outstanding, and small-town Austria is wonderful. Good food, mostly friendly people (although in true Teutonic fashion they can be pretty unreasonable at times, and let's not forget that they out-Nazied the Germans), great hotels and gasthauses. Driving can be a challenge on some of the mountain roads. Definitely a place to visit at least once.
