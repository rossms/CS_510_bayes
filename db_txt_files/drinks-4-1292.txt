All you people calling this bad beer are either taste challenged, or have not had a properly chilled fosters oil can. While it is a bit sweet, a nice, ice cold oil can is a great way to start the night, and it still tastes good when you get to the bottom and its kinda room temp. Also the Bitter oil cans are pretty tasty not, not as sweet with a nice bite.
