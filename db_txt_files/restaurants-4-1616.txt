In our area the quality and size of the chicken pieces varies from store to store depending on the owner of the franchise. You would think that KFC would have more control over the franchise owners. We can travel 20 miles and get a great meal instead of a so-so meal here in town. I've overheard this from other people while in that store so it's not just us. Tastes great! Too bad it's so unhealthy.
