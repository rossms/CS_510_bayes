dude gerry mcnamara is phenominal. i love him not just for his looks although that would be enough but for his skill. his ability to play the game is the hottest thing in the world to watch. he works his heart out and what i noticed and really liked was how he was willing to give his teammates a chance to take the shot before he would do it himself. that's what makes a great pointguard. he makes my heart race when i watch him on the floor. number 3 definitely eserves to held up high in the dome after he graduates.
