After the first time I visited a Caribou here in the Twin Cities I never went back to another coffee place again! Starbucks,etc. do not compare to the rich blends of Caribou. The atmosphere is very warm and relaxing and they offer the best cocoa for kids imaginable. I have ordered on line for gifts for those friends not fortunate enough to have one close by. I get the same question every year.... Am I getting Caribou for Christmas? I love to get the gift cards from others as well. It is a true treat, especially the Turtle Mocha!!! Absolutely heavenly!!
