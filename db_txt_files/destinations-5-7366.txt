Hands down, my favorite city in Europe. There's just something glamorous about the place that nowhere else (even NYC) can match. Sure, relations between the French and Americans aren't the best right now, but learn just a handful of French phrases and you'll find the locals' reputation for rudeness to be slightly overrated.
