I've eaten at Chili's about four or five times over the past 8 years in several different locations and each time in each location the experience was the same - bad. The food was not good (I've had the burger, a Jack Daniels steak [my most recent entree], and that stinking onion thing), service was horrible and the atmosphere is the same old tired neighborhood crap that everyone else has.
