more times than not, the wings i have had at hooters have been good. once in a while they will suck, but not usually. the hooters in houston have great looking attendants. ones in chicago not bad either. my current hooters is in milwaukee, and my experience there has been great so for. wish i would have thought of this: wings, girls and sports. Could have made a killing.
