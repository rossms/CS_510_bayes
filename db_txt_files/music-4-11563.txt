I especially like this CD because last summer I spent two weeks in Alaska. My friend and I rented a car and drove all around southern Alaska. Offspring was the only CD we found that was half way decent. Now, it has many ties to memories of a very epic experience in a very beautiful part of the world, which I spent with an incredibly special friend.
