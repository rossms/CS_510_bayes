Al Gore is an intelligent person who would make decisions based on facts and morality. My God! We can't have THAT in a president. My theory is that the people who voted for Bush didn't want anyone in the oval office who is smarter than them (i.e., the combined intelligence of a week's worth of Springer guests).
