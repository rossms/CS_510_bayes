I think if you loved the movie you'll love the soundtrack. Those of you who disliked Ewan and Nicole's singing steer clear of the soundtrack. However, it still has some great, groovy, dance mixes, eg. Lady Marmalade and Rhythm of the night. I strongly agree that those who hated the movie will despide the romantic recordings. But, I loved the movie and thus, enjoy the soundtrack just as much. Only movie lovers pick.
