Jason White is without a doubt the best OU quarterback in history. Anybody who is Sooner born and Sooner bred knows that. We didn't finish the season the way we obviously wanted to, but that is not Jason's fault. 2003 Heisman winner, 2x Maxwell winner, I love you Jason, you are the BEST!!! GO SOONERS!!!!
