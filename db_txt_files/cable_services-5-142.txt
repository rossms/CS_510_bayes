pim a technical rep for directv withh directv you can get more channels and were fixing to launch teo more satelites for more than 50 channels of hd programming for those people that cant get replacements and are worry about getting charged thats hogwash directv will give you free replacements if you pay your bill on time and just ask for it directv is way more customer focused thanany other provider if you switch to dish your still paying directv they use are satelites
