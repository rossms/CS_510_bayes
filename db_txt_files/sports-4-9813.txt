Name 4 Laker players other than Shaq and Kobe. That's what I thought. When those 2 have a solid game, the other 3 on the court just have to nail an open 3 every now and then. I can't stand Rick Fox, but he hits in clutch on occassion. Robert Horry...what can you say about him? He broke my heart when he nailed that clutch 3 against the Kings in the playoffs last year. My girlfriend thought something was seriously wrong when she heard me throw my coke across the room and yell a string of obscenities. Even with a weak record, the playoffs are a different season.
