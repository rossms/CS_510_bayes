I went to Pearl Harbor not expecting much, and I was pleasantly surprised. I can see that other RateItAll users were very scornful of the love story, but I enjoyed it. Yes, it was unrealistic, sappy, and predictable, but it drew me in nonetheless. (Ben Affleck deserves most of the credit for this.) I agree that the movie's strongest point was the chillingly realistic bombing of Pearl Harbor. The flying scenes of the Dolittle Raid were thrilling, too. This is a movie that's best seen on the big screen. Don't wait for it to come out on video.
