The 2001 QX4 has a smooth ride with outstanding interior comfort features - leather seats are comfortable, the instruments are easy on the eyes, and the sound system outstanding. The safety ratings are outstandind with the ALBrakes and plethora of air bags. In the Wisonsin snow, the 4 wheel drive is outstanding and above all the SUVs I tested. Downside to the QX4 - leg space, particularly the back seat.
