I gotta say that despite all the problems I have with some of Microsofts programs, Word I think, is one of the best they have. I really can't think of anything that I don't like about Word, it's easy to use, very well laid out, and can perform so many different functions. Easy to import and export documents, add images, create form fields, everything. I've used lotus, Amipro and Works in the past and I think hands down Word is the best of the lot. But hey that may just be me.
