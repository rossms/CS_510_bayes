I give this album a 4 because it is still a pretty good album. However, if I were to compare it to previous Weezer albums, Id have to give it around a 2. This is definitely Weezer's weakest album, but there are still some really good songs on the CD. Id still urge everyone to go buy the album, but if you want to truly hear how good Weezer is, buy the Blue Album and Pinkerton. They will blow your mind. The Green Album makes for easy listening, but doesn't really showcase their talent like Blue and Pinkerton did. However, compared to the other trash that is out nowadays, Weezer still scores a high grade.
