This pretty much tastes like you'd expect it to. If you think Vanilla Coke was a good idea, you'll like it; if you don't, you won't. I personally think it was a GREAT idea and I'm addicted to this stuff, which is bad because I typically try to stay away from non-diet soda. I did hear they're coming out with a diet version though, but until then I may very well be drinking a can of this every day!
