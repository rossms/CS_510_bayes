 The Parent Trap (1998) is just as charming as the original. Updated for the '90s, the show includes a few new twists but remains true to the overall plot of the 1961 version. Lindsay Lohan is absolutely terrific playing the twins, and Elaine Hendrix's portrayal of the twins' soon-to-be mother is classic. The supporting cast, playing Liz's butler and Nick's housekeeper, added a lot, too. I even enjoyed the movie's soundtrack. If you liked the original show, you'll be pleased with this updated version.
