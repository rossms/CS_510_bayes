There's just something about Elisabeth Shue- her beauty, her girl next door personality, a gentle warmness, something that just makes her so likable no matter who she is playing. She's a very talented actress, and I'd really like to see her career continue to flourish in the future. She gave a wonderful performance in Leaving Las Vegas . She was also impressive in The Saint and Palmetto . I can still remember her from the whacky Adventures in Babysitting and as Michael J. Fox's mom in Back to the Future II and III . She's a wonderful actress who deserves leading role after leading role.
