Great for kids, and not too sugary for adults; great for family viewing. Based on the series written under the pen-name Lemony Snicket, the movie covers at least the first few books (I haven't read them, though the few excerpts I have read reflects the same charming style as in the movie) about the adventures of the Baudelaire children-turned-orphans, and the eccentric Count Olaf who sought to gain their great inheritance. Cute storyline, colorful characters, good special effects, it all makes for an entertaining movie. Not for everyone, but certainly worth giving a shot.
