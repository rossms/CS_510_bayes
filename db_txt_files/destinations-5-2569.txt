I went with my dad, who hasnt been here since he left 33years ago. It was the most beautiful land I have ever seen. I did notice alot of the people speaking french, but I grew up fluent in english, french, spanish, and arabic so I had no problems with communication. The night life like redleb86 said is so much better than the states. Can't wait to go back.
