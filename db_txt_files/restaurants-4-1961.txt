Out of all the Mickey D's I have gone to, nationwide and hometown, I always get the same problem. When I order a milk shake of any kind, I always see an object in there. Everytime! But at BK, I have never experienced any problems. Sure their fries might be better, but that's about it. One category out of many that they can top!Overall BK tops them off.
