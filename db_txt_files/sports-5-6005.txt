J.J. is one of todays purest shooters if not the best. JJ Would shine on any team be it Duke or NCState. People think he is just s threat from the three but he can also get inside and make crazy layup. Anyone that watches Basketball durning the season and not just in March would no that. Also he did not come from a hella rich family. His family made an honest earning. It just so happens he has talent that every UNC to Kentucky fan is jealous of. UCONN has nothing on us we all know who really one that game.
