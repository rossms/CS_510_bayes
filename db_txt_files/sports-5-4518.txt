One of the best coaches in the land.Unranked going into the seasom, this years team (21-4)could end up as a 2-4 seed in the NCAAs. Coach Boeheim has kept the orangemen at or near the top of the Big East year after year. He has brought 2 teams to the final NCAA game.Never any rebuilding years. Great recruiter who lets his players show off their talents.Finds sleepers and turns them into stars. Does very well in International competition.The most underrated coach in the land.
