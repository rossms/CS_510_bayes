Parker Posey is definitely an underrated actress. No one really knows who she is but she is in a lot of movies. When I first found out who she was, was in 'Dazed and Confused'. She was the senior girl who was hazing the freshman and yells, 'fry like bacon you little freshman bitches'. She is also in 'You've got mail' as Tom Hanks' live in girlfriend. She is a good actress and has a lot of talent.
