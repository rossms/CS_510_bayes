Admittedly, I thought this would be pretty lame, but I was proven wrong. Simple plot with a diverse and colorful set of characters. The characters, though individually extreme, had great chemistry with each other. An eccentric but charming professor plots a scheme to rip off a casino riverboat with the help of a few interesting individuals, but is twarted by a sweet old chuch-going lady.A lot of strong language, but very funny.
