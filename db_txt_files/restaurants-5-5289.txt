The original Rock Bottom, on the 16th Street walking mall in Downtown Denver is an example of what a chain restaurant can be, if it is run by people who love food and drink. Excellent, hearty food (love the chicken fried steak) and truly remarkable brews; with a friendly, upbeat staff on top of it all. Denver's location has a pool hall in back which is a great meet market. Also live music on weekends and in the summer, AT LUNCH!!!!!
