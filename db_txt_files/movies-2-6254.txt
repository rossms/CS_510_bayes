Charlton Heston was not a good Moses. The Bible describes Moses as a poor speaker who he had to ask his brother Aaron to speak for him. But Cecil B. De Mille knew that his audience would not stand for a hero who was anything less than perfect. Heston overdoes his role as he does all his roles; he and William Shatner must have gone to the same acting school. The film gets an extra star for its impressive, groundbreaking special effects.
