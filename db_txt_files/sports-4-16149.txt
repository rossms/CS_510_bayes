What can you say about a quarterback who is one of the fastest players in the nfl with a strong arm and amazing agility? As long as he has a little help from the running game (I love it when they run the Power I with TJ Duckett in the line up) and a couple of decent receivers, I would be afraid to play against the Falcons.
