Big Red is my favorite soft drink. Unfortunately, there are very limited areas where you can find it. It's like a cream soda, but I've never tasted a red soft drink that tasted like Big Red, or that was as good as Big Red. I live in southwest Indiana, and I know that I couldn't get it even in the north half of the state. I think the bottles say that it's bottled in Waco, Texas. I'd recommend this drink highly!
