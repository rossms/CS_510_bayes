A flat out tasty beer. Bass played an important role in my alcohol education as the first beer that I ever had that didn't taste like crap (granted I had only had Busch, Lite, and Iron City). I will always have a fondness for Bass Ale, and am disappointed that it doesn't seem to be getting distributed as thoroughly as it used to be.
