Walter is greatness. He never ran out of bounds, and played on all downs. He played hurt and never complained. He played on horrible teams and still led the league, and he played with more heart than anyone. He always gave his all, and nobody did it better. Without a doubt #34 PAYTON is the best football player ever.
