It has great weed. the best i've smoked since san diego and daytona beach. the people are so down to earth. if your car breaks down here, people are actually going to help you cause they care here. i live in trashachutsetts and people are all about themselves and clam chowder. anyway, i liked nashville. that was a tight city with a lot of jobs and culture. definitely visit this state. if i could get a job here, i definitely would. i love the southern hospitality.
