Zook has done well with the players he has, there aren't many big names on this team. Chris Leak is probably the biggest name now that Ben Troupe is in the NFL. But he has kept the Gators in the top 25 most of the time, their impressive streak of weeks in the rankings was broken last year when they lost five games. Florida has shown hints of brilliance seeing as how they beat LSU, but they lost to a couple of teams they shouldn't have lost to (Ole Miss, among others), and they almost lost to Kentucky, which would have been bad. But props to Zook on his coaching job.
