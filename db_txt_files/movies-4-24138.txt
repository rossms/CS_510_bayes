I love the Jurassic Park movies, but I must say that this one was the disappointment of the three. (4th SCHEDULED to come out Summer, 2006) The plot was kinda bleh, but the effects were great! The action sequences were extremely suspenseful. The ending was kinda bleh, too. SUPPOSEDLY (this isn't a sure thing), the 4th movie will take place in North America also, with dinosaurs rampaging everywhere. Hopefully, they'll do a better a job this time.
