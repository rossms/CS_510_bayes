Unfortunately, my expectations were way too high before watching this film. Everyone had told me how great it was, it had won multiple Oscars, etc. I still thought it was very good, but not great. Spacey and Benning were tremendous, the dialogue was funny and interesting, and the story was original. If I'd seen it on the night it opened, I quite possibly could have thought it was great. It was also good to see Scott Bakula back on the big screen with his most memorable role since Necessary Roughness.
