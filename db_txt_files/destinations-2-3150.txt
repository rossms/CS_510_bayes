Toronto Sucks and the people are unfriendly compared to other cities. Most of the women I encountered are stuck-up bitches who think they are everything. The only reason it gets 2 stars is that it offers a good variety of restaurants, movie houses, theatre and clubs. Toronto is an expensive city with a charge for just about everything. Toronto has a sour pickle shoved up its arse and can kiss my ass!
