Skoal is a good dip to start out with, but if you're a true dipper you move on to bigger and better things such as Kodiak. I'm not a fan of all of the fruity flavors, as I tend to stick with the good old Skoal Straight. I don't mind that other people dip em so I can snag a pinch of somethin different every once in a while, but you won't find me with a tin of candy in my back pocket. Email me at Ncarolina2006@netscape.net if theres any new BUZZ about Skoal.
