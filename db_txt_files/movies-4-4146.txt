good movie. Charlie gets the golden ticket and goes to the magnificent chocolate factory. Gene Wilder is wonderful as the eccentric Willy Wonka. Charlie goes there with his grandpa and four other kids and parents. the other kids are obnoxious brats and each suffer a fate that has to do with their most rotten fault. Violet the gumchewing kid eats gum and turns into a blueberry. Mike tv, gets zapped into a tiny self that would fit in a tv etc. The movie gets especially good when they go to the factory. A good fantasy movie.
