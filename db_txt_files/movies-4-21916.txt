im saving the 5 star for terminator 3, the best movie i've watched that's better than the original, the liquid metal makes it more exciting as his enemy outwitted him just because of this metal, Arnold did his best to melt him for that's the end of the liquid metal man, comes the liquid metal woman in part 3.. stay tuned! how about a liquid metal family versus a family of terminators...
