I really like Brett Favre the football player. He's a throwback. He plays like a linebacker with a rifle for an arm and the grit to get things done. I can't rate him 5 stars because he's not a classic quarterback, but give him a chance to draw a play in the dirt with a stick and improvise while he's waiting for his receivers to get open, and that's what makes him a winner. But, now he's getting old and he's hurt, and maybe it's time for his body to get a rest.
