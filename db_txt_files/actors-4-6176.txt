I think he's a very talented actor but for some reason I just feel like he's way full of himself, hence the 4. I thought he did a great job in Dead Again back in the early 90's as the detective/murdered wife of long ago. His Hamlet was quite good as well but this is the sort of role where I start the think he likes himself too much. Also he's got the creepiest lips around, yeah that's right lips. They are virtually non-existent, he looks as if he was born without lips and the doctors just made a slit where his mouth belonged, very unsettling.
