I can't stand Cowher bashers. I remember a long stretch during the eighties when we'd sell our souls for competative Steeler football. Cowher came in and brought respectability with him, and since then our team has consistently performed at a high level. Maybe Cowher never wins the big one, but I'll take playoffs nearly every year over 6 and 10 every year. I thank God each season that we don't have to deal with the revolving door that many other fans have to deal with.
