I like Target, the stores are bright and clean, not as jammed packed as Wal-Mart is, I have purchased clothes there, mostly slacks, they are fine, have purchased small appliances, gardening stuff, household stuff there with no problems at all. The only thing I hate is check out, very confusing as to who is open and who is not with the staggered checkout stands, don't like that at all and it does keep me from Target at certain times like Xmas.
