Though never a Celtic fan, I grew to accept defeat while admiring the heart, tenacity and clutch performance of Hondo Havlicek. Not terribly flashy, but certainly fundamentally sound. In fact, I don't know if this stat is available, but I'd be willing to wager that Hondo had one of the lowest turnover ratio rates. More importantly, John's conduct on the court was above reproach--he carried himself with the grace that is certainly lacking in today's players. His hustle and professionalism makes him an easy pick for the 12-all time greats!!!
