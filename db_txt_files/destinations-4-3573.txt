MN is a good place to live (good economy, low crime, good public schools, good health care) but as a vistor, it isn't the most exciting place to go (other than the performing arts, there isn't a whole lot going on - unless you like shopping at malls.) Fezzador, get outta the '60's. Any MN politician will tell you that MN is a swing state - that's why it's been close in 4 out of the last 6 presidential elections, why it has a GOP governor and senator, and why 5/7 of the statewide elected officials are GOP. MN is becoming a national bellweather state.
