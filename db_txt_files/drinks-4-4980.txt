I'm drinking a Cherry Coke right now, and it tastes pretty good. Cherry Coke has the perfect balance of cola and cherry flavors, and it's not too sweet. Another user mentioned a sweet aftertaste, but I can't detect one at all. I don't drink Cherry Coke very often, but it hits the spot every once in a while.
