Cameron Diaz is hot in this movie. I dont buy Pacino as a football coach, and the football both on the field and off was way too over the top for me. Many people claim it is the most realistic football scenes in any movie. Maybe the hits are the most violent, but that doesnt that doesnt make it realistic. One of the worst sports films ive seen.
