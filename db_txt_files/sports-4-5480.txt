Wade is probably one of the most prolific scorers in the draft. He can create shots better than anyone. His ability to drive to the hole and finish is excellent. Somewhat small for a SG and he definitely needs improvement beyond 15ft . That should come with time and practice. The potential is there and thanks to his work ethic, he can reach stardom in the NBA.
