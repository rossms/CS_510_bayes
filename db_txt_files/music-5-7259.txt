What a feast for the eyes! Visually spectacular, musically awe-inspiring and heart-wrenchingly poignant in all it's operatic grandeur, in terms of the apex of music videos, this is it. Poodle perms, deserted churches, super models, grand pianos and that sun-kissed Les Paul...nothing encapsulates old school rock quite like Guns N' Roses. This is no music video, this is an eight minute epic.
