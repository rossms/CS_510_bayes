Although I personally like this beer, I must in all fairness say that it's an acquired taste. It has a very hoppy taste to it that some might find objectionable. It's also somewhat pricey, and there are other beers that I think are much better that don't cost quite as much. I have gotten a few bottles of Urquell that had a skunky taste, a phenomenon that according to an acquaintance in the brewing industry is quite common in beers in green or clear bottles.
