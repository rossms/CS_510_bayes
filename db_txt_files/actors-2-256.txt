Gregory Peck is my idea of believable low key. Gary Cooper, on the other hand, is SO low key, had I been one of his directors, I would have been tempted to constantly stop production and check for a pulse. On top of that, each of his characters seemed imperceptible from the other. Not to mention that he delivered his lines like near sited guy with a bad memory straining to see a teleprompter. Not all oldies are goodies.
