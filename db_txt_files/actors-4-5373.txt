Dennis Quaid has done some really wonderful work. The movie about the stonecutters is one of my favorites; the Big Easy is also one of my lifetime favorite movies. I liked Frequency, it is good family fare, only a little violence. I think his wife is sickening. She is a miserable individual. She should take a lesson from Kevin Costner whom she seems to have modeled her behavior after. This is probably a tough time for Dennis, but he will make it through OK. The little boy needs stability right now and it seems like the only chance he has is if his dad keeps his wits about him. Kathleen
