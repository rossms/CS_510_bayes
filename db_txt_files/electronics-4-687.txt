The Nokia 8800 is the most practible phone on the market. It holds more phone numbers than any other phone. It has the most effective battery life and it is user friendly. What's bad is the size. I feel it is too small. It's easy to lose, easy to break, and there are no supplies to purchase for the phone like clips or accesories.
