if you thought it was impossible for a major world city to be literally really clean and safe, you thought wrong. this city is pretty impressive when it comes to that. they have such unique artistic sense. but they're way into gadgets. even the macdonald's has electronic sliding glass doors. might seem too futuristic at times, but there are some beautiful parks and rock gardens. it is expensive though, and you better be a fan of seafood.
