I see a lot of comments about Ray Lewis being a thug and ruining team chemistry, but they must not be watching the same games. Ray Lewis elevates the play of every single member of the Ravens defense. In addition to being the most naturally gifted LB in the game, his intensity and purpose turn good to great around him. If you want to talk about people who ruin teams, look to Randy Moss.
