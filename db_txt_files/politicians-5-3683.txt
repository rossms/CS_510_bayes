I think George W. Bush is just what this country needs. So he's not perfect. At least he admits it faces up to mistakes he's made in the past, instead of lying about it. That's more than we can say for the Clinton-Gore administration. (And note to the person named Wondering...are you really that stupid?? Dubya is what they call George because his middle initial is W ...hence Dub-ya !! DUH!! So these are the kind of retards we have voting...no wonder Al came so close to winning!!).
