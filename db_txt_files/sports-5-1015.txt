changes how managers call the game of baseball more than any other player alive. who cares if he's a jerk. would u rather have a athlete straight out show and tell u that he's a a-hole or one that pretends he's a good guy for PR purposes and THEN is a a-hole after the shoot? say what u want about the man but he's still the best in baseball
