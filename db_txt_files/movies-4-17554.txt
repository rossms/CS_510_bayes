I thought this was pretty good movie.It was in Brasil and this woman was a letter writer for the illeterate. Except she was not an honest person and did not send most of the letters. She meets a woman and her son who wants her to write a letter searching for the boys father. the woman dies in an accident in front of the woman and the boy. One thing leads to another and the letter writer decides to take the boy to his father. It is good for the most part although it drags a bit in spots.Of course the dishonest letter writer ends up being a good person.and she and the boy form a friendship.
