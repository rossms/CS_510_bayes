Bush has no integrity. His battle cries were I trust the people! and I'm for state government handling their own affairs! , both of which have been proven to be lies. He voted in hand recounts in his own state, yet fights to have them thrown out in Florida, which shows he will do anything to win, including conniving, distorting the truth, and calling upon the heavy hand of his fellow republicans in the federal court. He will have no legitimacy if the recounts are not completed.
