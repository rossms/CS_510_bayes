A truly excellent game, then and now! The graphics (at the time, they are a bit dated now) were excellent, and the AI for the computer made the game get more difficult, the better you played. Playing this game two player over the internet was also a blast, even better than Doom or Quake, due to the three dimensions! The bosses were very challenging to beat, and the storyline was great! If you have a chance, you should pick up a copy and try it. You won't regret it.
