Ah, Mcdonalds. I remember when I use to eat there. That is unitl I found out that it's the lowest of the low when it comes to fast food resturants. The only thing Mcdonald's has that's even worth to be considered quality is their salads, fries, and their Mcflurries (the rip off of Blizzards). McDonalds was the reason why I hated hamburgers growing up. The BigMac has to be the worst sandwhich ever created. What's left? The chicken sandwhiches? Wendy's makes a chicken sandwhich. Mickey does not. Mcdonalds is now considereda last resort when it comes to survival.
