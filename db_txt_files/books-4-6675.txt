I wish I'd read The Hobbit before reading Lord of the Rings -- not for the continuity, because each book stands on its own, but because The Hobbit suffers in comparison. The Hobbit is a good story, great adventure, but lacks the incredible depth, the history and tradition, the sheer magic of the trilogy that follows. Having said that, it's still a great book and thoroughly enjoyable.
