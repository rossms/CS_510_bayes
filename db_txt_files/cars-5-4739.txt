I have a 2001 Ford Ranger and I have had it for 3 weeks now and I love it, its has almost all the options including power windows, locks, and mirrors, and it also has the 4th door. It has an automatic transmission w/ the 3.0 V6 and it gives power whenever needed, havent had a problem out of my ranger yet. It didnt come with fog lights or running bars but I will b geting them soon, this is a very durable truck and mine has 29,000.
