Unlike her uncivil, party-towing, divisive, disrespectful peer in the Senate, Barbara Boxer, Dianne Feinstein has been a good U.S. Senator for Californians. I really do not agree with most of what she says, but she can at least be a professional (something Boxer isn't). She is, above all, a woman who believes in what she says and usually follows through. For this, she deserves to be respected.
