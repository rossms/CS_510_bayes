You can't stop him, neh, neh, ne-ne-neh-neh! Carolina has him and you don't! We have a guaranteed 2 points at any time, and you don't, neh, neh, ne-ne-neh! He was late for class?- you can't stop him. He said something politically incorrect?- you can't stop him. The look on his face does not sit right with you?- you can't stop him. Nobody can guard him, and that's that! I don't care if he strangled your preacher with piano wire. Will he embarass any defender in college ball?- yes. End of Story!
