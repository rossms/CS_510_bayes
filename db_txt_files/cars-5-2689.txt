the people that rated it 1 star are idiots.. they think that japanese horsepower is cool? all it is are high preformance four cylinders with giant tips and glass packs on them. and they sound like a bee. they don't have the rumble of pure american horsepower. think about it if you buy a civic or a supra you have to modify them to get this kind of horsepower.THIS IS STOCK!!!!!
