Janet Reno has proven to be a person capable of handling a job through enforcing the Law and standing strong against the propaganda of the GOP and it's rightwing affiliates during the Clinton Administration. She did NOT enable bush jr to win FL, FL was bought and paid for by his bro jeb and GOP southern cronies. IF jeb was not Gov of FL this Country would not have the puppet-boy in the white house today! Go Janet Reno!
