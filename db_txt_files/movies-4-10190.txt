I guess it's kind of sappy, but I really, really liked this movie. It's no 5-star Schindler's List or Godfather, but it's a good romantic comedy and worth seeing. Tom Hanks does a great job, and so does Darryl Hannah, who I usually don't like very much. John Candy is also great as Hanks' goofy buddy.
