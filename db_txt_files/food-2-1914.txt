Mentos are OK if eaten one at a time. But to eat them by the handful is pointless. They don't taste like anything special. And those damn Mentos commercials must discourage a lot of potential customers. I mean, who do they think they are advertising to? My day doesn't improve if I pull out a pack of Mentos, dammit! They lied to me!! The commercial said my whole life would improve if I popped a Mento in my mouth and it didn't!! Those bastards! That's it...I'm suing the Mentos Corporation for ruining my life.
