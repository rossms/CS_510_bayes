I'm currently an MBA student with 3 classes left. Great instructors. Classes are small enough to allow for productive learning and interaction. Classmates experiences guided by instructor input provide a big portion of the appeal to me. I also feel that the online method prepares the student for the future's increased use of online work group collaboration methods. Thanks to technology my co-worker does not necessarily live in the same country as I do.
