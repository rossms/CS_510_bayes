This city is actually pretty amaizing and has come a long way since 1989, not at all one of the worst cities in the world at one point as Richy said. It was once called the Little Paris because of its marvelous architecture. Bucharest is a modern day metropolis, complete with nice shops and boutiques, good restaurants, convenient public transportation, fabulous nigth life, luxury hotels. Just be street smart, like in any other big city.
