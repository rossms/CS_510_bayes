The band's most ambitious album. 9 songs spanning over 65 minutes! Mind you, that was unprecedented back in 1988. The album is clearly demonstrative of the band's intent to slow things down a bit. I'm not going to bitch about the production, because production is something that can be corrected easily enough.
