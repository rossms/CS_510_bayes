Awesome city! Very beautiful and scenic. Beautiful area - the Bay Area, as well. There's a lot to like about this place. If I had to nitpick it, I'd point out the large gay population could make some feel uncomfortable and the cost of living is high. Not very diverse with minorities aside from Asians.
