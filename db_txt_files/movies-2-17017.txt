Bad. The amazing one word description. There is no chill factor in this movie, and while the aimless killing of a psychotic individual is the point of the film. No background is given, and most of the scenes in which the killer is preparing to murder another victem are simply comical. There is no inward horror or struggle by the main character, and his relationship with his supporting cast is not well conveyed.
