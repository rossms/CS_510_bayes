Just bought the 06 grizz and I love it. I've ridden everything from Artic crap to Honda and never had a smoother faster ride. No problems with the gas boiling or anything else to this point. Of course I rode her hard for about two weeks in the mountains and nothing has come loose or rattled. Started fine in cold weather as well, it was 5 and 6F on consecutive mornings. Just had to adjust the low speep idle a bit. GREAT MACHINE
