I love Macy's! It always feels like I'm in the elite city, because the clothes are a classier step up, and so are the housewares, children's clothes, etc. (My one gripe is the junior's dept....clothes EVERYWHERE - all over the floor, just too unpleasant to even browse!) But I think anyone who goes to the Macy's in San Francisco will see what I mean about the elite 'city magic'. The little cafe on the bottom floor, the mirrored escalators...I love shopping in stores like that! :)
