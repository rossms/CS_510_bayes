A good fun movie that captures the spirit of its time. Broderick does a great turn as the smartassed most popular kid in the school, as does the guy who plays his loser mate. I guess FB is the kind of teen many of us would've liked to've been rather than being spotty and awkward with girls. It may've dated a bit because of the very 1980s vibe but it still gives off a good feel.
