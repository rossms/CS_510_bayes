There are two things I like about Spanky. First, he was an admirer (and imitator) of Oliver Hardy. Second, even as a toddler, he was able to totally resist stealing glances at the camera. However, as he grew older, his acting got worse. Fortunately, he grew up to be a real nice man in his later years.
