They need to stop trying to be fashionable and shoot for stylishness instead. BB makes some genuinely weird mens clothing. I don't quite understand who the target audience is...men that like to feel like a 12-year old or actual 12-year olds? Quality-wise, it's wearable, it doesn't distort as badly as some other budget brands do. This doesn't elevate its rating, however, their sense of design is that bad.
