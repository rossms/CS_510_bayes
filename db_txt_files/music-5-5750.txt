Classic album and band, along with Maiden, Priest are the Gods of Heavy Metal, if you have not heard them yet do so now, decide for yourself, but if its British Metal you like Priest is at the top of the gerne. Track three of British Steel says it all Metal Gods . Other great Priest albums to check out would be Hell Bent For Leather, Screaming For Vengeance, Defenders Of The Faith, or if you can find it Sad Wings Of Destiny. But those are just for starters, I enjoy Priest on any of their albums.
