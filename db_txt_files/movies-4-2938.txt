The Perfect Storm is an entertaining movie. There are some extremely cheesy parts but that is to be expected with George Cloony and Marky Mark starring in the movie. The reason I gave it a 4 and not a 3 because this movie really was just okay but it is a true story. You see how crazy fishing really is. You never really think about the underworld or subculture of these fishing towns, so it made it more interesting.
