Bush relates well with the American people. He is undoubtedly genuine and sincere. Bush has shown he is a great leader by standing by the issues he deems most important. He is not swayed by what is popular, he stands by what is right. He is a true definition of a steadfast leader, we need him another 4 years in an era where terrorism is extremely apparent.
