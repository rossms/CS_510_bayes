He'll go down as one of football's better quarterbacks. Borderline Hall-of-Famer. Good career stats and led his team to the 1996 Super Bowl. You also have to remember that the Pats would not have won their first Super Bowl had Bledsoe not filled in for injured Tom Brady in the 2001/2 AFC Conference Final. He did have a great first season with Buffalo and did lead the Bills to a 9-7 record this year. He might have enough in the tank to help Dallas. But with guys like Vinny T., Eddie George, and Bledsoe, one wonders if Bill Parcells is going to sign Sammy Baugh and Chuck Bednarik next.
