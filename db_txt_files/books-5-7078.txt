Some slow bits here and there, but as a 10 book series (or 2 series of 5 books each, depending on how you want to look at it), The Amber Chronicles create a rich and diverse universe with a multitude of multi-layered characters. I also like how you read the story from the first-person point of view. The role-playing game which is based on the books is also very fun and interesting.
