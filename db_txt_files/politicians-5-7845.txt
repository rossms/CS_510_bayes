The most overlooked president in history. This man did more for the civil rights movement than kennedy or Johnson. In 1948 this man from Missouri intergrated the armed forces. He ended world war II by having the atomic bomb dropped. He was a man of courage, and strength and he didn't always do what was popular. He did how however do what he felt was right.
