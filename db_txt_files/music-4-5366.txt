I admit, I am a mark for Del. I love the music and his delivery, but I am also a purest and as much as country music today is mostly pop, I consider bluegrass a totally different type of music. Country started as bluegrass and the blues being meshed together, but today's country is far from it. Del has had many great albums and this is just one of his many triumphs.
