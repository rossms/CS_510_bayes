Beautiful, quaint, green, colonial, beachy...what more could you want? The South is different, so come with open eyes and take it all in. Not a tourist trap, but a working community, with carriage tours and cannon gardens, sweet grass baskets and sweet iced tea. Sometimes I lie and call it home. You'll want to do the same.
