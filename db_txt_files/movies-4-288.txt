Gladiator's one of those films that needs the big screen because the action + spectacular scenery are what keep it going. Once you see it on TV there's not enough plot to keep you interested and the impact of the action diminishes. 5 stars seeing it at the cinema first time around, dropping to 3 stars when seeing it on TV.
