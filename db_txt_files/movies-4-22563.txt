This comic book type action movie- in fact, the entire Batman series- shows great insight into how and why the title character became who he is best known for. From the first film on, the viewer is invited more and more into the troubled but good natured life of a millionaire crime fighter, which is good for connecting with the character. What I also like is the fact that Batman was one of the first comic book heroes to rely on technology, not superhuman powers, to combat the growing criminal element of his home city.
