I have been waiting for the ideal skater game for a long time until this came out. It is realistic in a sense that you can change attributes for your board, and build skills. It also fulfills fantasy skating because some tricks and jumps are impossible. This game has good music, gameplay, and it is fun and addicting. It makes you want to go to a vertical skate park to injure yourself.
