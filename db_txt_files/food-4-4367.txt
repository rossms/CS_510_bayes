Back in the good old days when people weren't obsessed with fat, salt, and everything else, my mom used to serve us Fritos. I loved their greasy, salty taste. They were especially good with bologna (horrors!) sandwiches. I'd never buy Fritos as an adult, but I don't hesitate to have a few when they're served out. The barbecue-flavored Fritos are especially tasty. I know it's good to have more knowledge about food and its effects on health, but it certainly cuts down on the joy of eating. Maybe someday researchers will discover the health benefits of eating Fritos. Until then, I'll stick with pretzels.
