Grizzly rules!! best tasting, longest lasting and definately the strongest you can get. I think the wintergreen fine cut is soaked in pure nicotene. But I prefer the long cut, only because the fine cut gets all over your teeth, i mean it spreads out, guess thats why is so much more potent. If you havent try it, you should it's only $2.
