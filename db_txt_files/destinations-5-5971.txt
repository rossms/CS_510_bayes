Will be there every chance that I get. If you can get past the the Lawyers pretending to be Brad Pitt in A River Runs Through It and their bazillion dollar fly fishing get-ups, you will love it. The people are incredibly nice, polite, and educated. Life in Montana is about living every day, not keeping up with the Joneses. The Rainbow Lodge south of Bozeman is beautiful with great folks running it. Sample the local brew Moose Drool on the back porch overlooking the Gallatin River. God Bless Montana!
