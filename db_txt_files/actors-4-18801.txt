 Pulp Fiction was a great movie. Do you remember how hot Tarantino was after that movie hit? People were talking about him like he was a genius. And his earlier movie Reservoir Dogs ensures that he's not a one-hit wonder. But what else has he done? Jackie Brown ? Ugh. And please tell me what possessed this guy to start acting? You'd think someone intelligent enough to direct Pulp Fiction would know better than to take a crappy part in From Dusk Till Dawn.
