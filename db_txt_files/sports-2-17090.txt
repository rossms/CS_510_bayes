The players on this team as a whole have dropped the ball this past year. The offense may take less of the blame though considering that TB realistically never had a good offense to begin with. Despite some early injuries to key first stringers, the defense has blown some huge games. Their offense, again, sure didn't help them out when they did their job. Gruden's performance as a coach is not the main factor here. He has to look for an offense next year, and get the mindset of his defense back on track again.
