Germany would be in the #1 place I would love to visit. Without a doubt. Love the food, people, wine, landscape and culture. Would really enjoy taking part in the Oktoberfest celebration and visiting the vineyards. There is just too much to see and do that I'd have to keep going back... Did you know that German wine is very highly rated in the world, if you haven't tried it, please do so. Anything with the rating Qualitatswein mit Pradikat (english: wine of distinction) is awesome. Greetings from Canada eh! danke :)
