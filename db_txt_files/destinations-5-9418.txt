The Jewish quarter (area? neighborhood?) in Prague, of which the cemetary is a part, is an incredible don't miss it attraction in the city. The cemetary itself was interesting, and I think everyone comes out with the same photograph of crooked, battered tombstones crowded together much too close. If I was rating the cemetary alone I'd give it a 3 or 4, but taken as a part of a whole (being the Jewish area/quarter/neighborhood/museum), it gets a 5 rating from me.
