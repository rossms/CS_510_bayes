MASH is definitely more well remembered for the TV show, but the movie is actually pretty good. It's kind of funny to see how all of the characters compare with the ones from the TV show. One piece of trivia...Gary Burghoff is the only actor who played his character (Radar) in both the movie and the TV show.
