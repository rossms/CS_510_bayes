The reason this is great is because it is by far the best stuff out there under 6.00 a half pint. Its a little rough as most bourbon is but a surprizingly easy aftershock (aftertaste) makes it a perfect cheap drink. I would actully prefer this over some high dollar stuff. itts every bit as good to me as makers mark,jack daniels and wild turkey 101 well maybe not as good as wild turkey 101 but as good as the rest Remember if your not used to bourbon STAY AWAY FROM THIS! But next time your a little low on cash and want to enjoy an all around good bourbon, This is your drink!!! RECOMENDED A+++!!!
