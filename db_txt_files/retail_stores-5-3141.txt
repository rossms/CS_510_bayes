A truly great franchise store, with some AWESOME prices! Their service is great and their store layout is very intuitive. Also, all of their rentals are five days, unlike the questionable two-days-only for New Releases found at Blockbuster. Just recently, the Hollywood Video nearest to me placed all of their Nintendo 64 games on sale for 9.99 (+ their current buy-two-get-one free deal). I was able to pick from any of their rentals and got awesome games at incredible prices! Their pre-viewed DVDs are also plentiful and brilliantly-priced! Shop there! You will not be dissappointed!
