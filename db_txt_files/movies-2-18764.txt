I have tried not once but three times to watch this so called EXCELLANT SCARY MOVIE, and have fallen asleep all three times. Honestly, couldn't keep my eyes open to watch this thing, it was that sad. Everyone was so surprised at the ending they said, i wonder how they ever got that far too see the end. I know what happened at the end only because I got tired of trying to watch it and finally asked someone who did. BORING is an understatement.
