As an avid fan and owner of 3 harley-davidson's, I bought a Road Star Limited Edition for my wife and I just have to say that this is one magnificent machine. Endless chrome,beautiful styling, an ecxellent ride both solo and with the person you love, you just cant beat it. I'm getting one myself. I never thought a japanese bike could be so nice as this one. Test drive one and see for yourself, you won't be dissapointed!
