listen, forget you ricky haters and tricks who wont let go of ricky's mistakes in the past. if your going to stay living in the past then i guess yeah ricky is just an alright player with explosive hops and an ego that outways the rest of the team. But if you look at him now, an explosive player who comes off the bench to change the tempo of the game and incoorperates the rest of the team with his scoring and team defense. Seriously ricky loves the game and is going to be one of the better attributes to the celts. forget bron bron
