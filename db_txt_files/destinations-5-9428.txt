This monument looks really impressive from a distance and it can be seen puncturing the skyline from all corners of the city. When standing beneath the cathedral looking up at the dome one notices so much architectual detail and I felt privelidged to have been there, yet the exterior almost faded into insignificance for me when I viewed the awesome interior. I was not prepared for the sights that greeted me and the artwork took my breath away. This reminder of a bygone era is an absolute must for anyone visiting the city for the first time.
