I've been in a lot of grocery stores in my life,Penn Fruit,Hills,Food Fair,FoodTown. You know what they are all gone,but not Waldbraums,you know why,they are the best,clean,helpful,fast service its such a pleasure to shop there. One question,who puts the rubberbands on the lobsters,very tricky business....
