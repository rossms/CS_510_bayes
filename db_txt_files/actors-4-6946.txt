I'm sorry but I love this guy. Ever since I watched him in the goofy Breakfast Club meets X-Files horror/comedy/teensploitation/comedy/coming of age/eye candy flick The Faculty as the loner drug dealer, Zeke. What a cool part. His hair looks like it was modled after a pissed off Moe from the Three Stooges. He is an impressive serious actor as well as he proved with The Virgin Suicides. However he has sold out and done some complete sh*t films like Pearl Harbor and O. I cannot wait to see his next project, Black Hawk Down. Good young talent.
