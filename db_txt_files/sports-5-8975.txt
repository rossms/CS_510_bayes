Prince is quickly evolving into a all-star caliber player. His offense is catching up to his undeniably great defense. He doesn't have the typical NBA attitude, and he certainly doesn't seek attention like so many of his peers, but any student of the game can see he has yet to reach his full potential. I can't wait to see him in 2 to 3 years.
