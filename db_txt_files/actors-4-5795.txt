If you read about me, you'd know I love history. So does he. He's very cute. Although if he was in my league, sorry he's not my type. Titanic is the bomb. Leo blew all actors away in that role. If not for his Brazilian girlfriend and some of his junk roles, Leo would have gotten a five star from me. Rock on!!!!!!!
