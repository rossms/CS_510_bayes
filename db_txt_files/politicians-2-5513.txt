I think he's a poor choice for the Presidency. He's weak on the issues, and he carries around hypocrisy like heavy airline baggage. He will vote for things when they are popular (the war in Iraq, the Patriot Act) and then deny it the next minute, or give some half-assed excuse why. We don't need a president who withholds the truth from the people and makes up lame excuses. And I'm as anti-Bush as you can get.
