When I was a young child(about 5) I ate some of Muffin's (our nasty hyperactive overgrown poodle) Gainesburgers..My dad said, here take a sip of this. It was the infamous Highball. I don't know if I liked it or not, I don't even know what is in a Highball. There is just something nostalgic about it for me. Whenever we had company, my dad would make highballs..here, take this highball to grandma..Honey, can I have another highball glass? Do you need another highball? By the way, highballs are an excellent accompaniment to Gainesburgers.
