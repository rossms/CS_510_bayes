Yea , it has gone down hill a little over the years, but this was the only pizza place in my town growing up, and it still has the best pizza. It tastes much better in the restaurant then carryout though. The independent, family-owned pizza places in my city definately have better pizza, but as far as national chains, Pizza Hut is the best.
