Their commercials seem to be making waves with their singing soggy bread creatures and that's probably what the marketers want. I'll admit they made me laugh just because they were so stupid. Looked like something my younger brothers would have made back in their idiot days of jr. high with dead bug parts and moldy bread. As for the subs, average at best and priced ridiculously. I refuse to pay $8 for a stinking sub.
