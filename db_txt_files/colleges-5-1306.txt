first, people at duke are not elitist. most of the snobby kids came in that way and you can't expect the school to work miracles. second, are you saying, then, that students at harvard, princeton, yale, etc, are not snobbish and elitist? if so, you really ought to look at the schools again. I know quite a few ivy leaguers and the account for a good number of the pompous jerks in the world. but I won't dismiss their entire institution as such.
