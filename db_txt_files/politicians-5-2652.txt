I have to say that Mr. McCain made the best McCain fries I have ever in my life tasted. If only he didn't add his special mustard and goat cheese formula to these crisp fries, he might have been the president. Tis a shame that Americans make terrible accusations to Mr. McCain's homemade fries!!! Shame on you for not enjoying his special mustard and goat cheese formula as much as I did!!
