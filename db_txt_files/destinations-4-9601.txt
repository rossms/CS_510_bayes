these cigarettes r pretty hard to find, but not as hard as other cigarettes. they last pretty long (10-15 minutes depending on how often you hit it) even though they seem thinner than the average death stick theyre packed like a motherfxker, their filters taste like cinammon and they get you light headed for a while... i think theyre pretty good for a once in a while time deal, but i wouldnt smoke them leisurely. i usually have one in case when i dont feel like THEEEE best cigarette in the world-- Marlboro Lights =)
