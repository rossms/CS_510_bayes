Not the most beautiful site on earth, but definitely impressive! The water fall is so big and the water is always tough, add some fog, wow, what a site! This is truly a place for a romantic hideout or just to relax from whatever stress you have. With many other attractions built at Niagra Falls, it is the perfect place to go in the summer. You would feel free once you see it!
