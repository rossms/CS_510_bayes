A war hero for sure, but also a political oppurtunist of the worst kind. Lost all respect for the man when he allowed the Bush campaign henchmen to run rough shod all over his integrity and that of his families, during the primaries in the southern states in 2000. Also lost points by not standing up for his friend and fellow Vet-John Kerry, when the not-so Swift Veterans started thier campaign of disinformation about Senator Kerrys record in Vietnam. Also McCain/Feingold ensured 2 party/Neo-Con rule for at least another generation. He is not to be trusted.
