I chose to return to OU for my master's degree because of the faculty, not the nightlife around Norman. If you're interested in an education this is the place for you; if you're more concerned about being entertained every evening then you're options will be quickly exhausted. The campus is expanding annually and the preservation of many original structures such as the Bizzell library is going well. This campus is impressive and more traditional than many I've seen and it becomes more comfortable as you become more familiar with what it has to offer.
