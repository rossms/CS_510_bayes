Classic! If your only knowledge of the Ingalls is the TV show, pick up the books! They are so wonderful--a beautifully described picture of what life was like nearly 150 years ago. Big Woods is the most simplistic (my favourite is actually Farmer Boy ), but it's a good introduction, and an easy book to read *to* your children. My mother still reads these books!
