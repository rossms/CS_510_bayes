One of the most intriguing states in the country, from the deserts surrounding Phoenix, to the high mountains of Flagstaff, to the gorgeous red rocks of Sedona, to the depths of the Grand Canyon. Definitely worth visiting, and Phoenix's conveniently central location and excellent airport makes for a great jumping-off point for visitors.
