I am glad to be the first to rate this fine product. Smucker's uncrustables are so good, I was really suprised when I tried one for the first time, the bread is so fresh and the peanut butter and jelly are put on perfect....Very tasty, good when you are stoned or sober, good for the whole family , a good item to put in the lunch box for work. I recommend.
