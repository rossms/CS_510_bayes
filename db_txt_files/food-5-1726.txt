Twizzlers are the BEST movie theater munchie. Buy a big bag of these at the counter or if you're really swift pick up a 1 pounder at the supermarket before you arrive and they'll last the whole movie. Not too sweet, silent chewing so you don't bother the people sitting next to you like it does when you have to listen to some guy shoving handfulls of popcorn into his gullet and mash them up for two hours. Yum dilly!
