LeBron looks like the real deal. His debut against a championship caliber Kings team was one of the most dominant in NBA history. I am blown away by 1) his court vision; 2) his body (if i had his build when i was 19, i may have gotten some dates); 3) the way that the game seems to slow down for him. 4) the fact that he is playing POINT GUARD. It won't be long before he gets 5 stars from me.
