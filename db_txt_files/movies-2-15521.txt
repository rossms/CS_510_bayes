Another remake, of one of the greatest tragedies of all time. I suggest you watch *It Happened One Night* to get a more accurate version of the sinking of the Titanic. Celine Dion has a great voice, but that song nearly drove me over the edge. James Cameron should take a very early retirement from directing.
