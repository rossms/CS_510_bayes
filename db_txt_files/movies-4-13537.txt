When I saw this movie, I hadn't heard any of the hype about it; therefore, I had no expectations. I liked the movie because it forced me to lose precious sleep. Anything that can keep up during the few hours I actually get to sleep must pretty decent. I tried to watch it again many months later, and just didn't care. It's defenitely a one-time event.
