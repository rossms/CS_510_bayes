Just what college athletics needs. A good person, good family man and a great coach. Success is measured by more than wins and losses. Coach Nutt is successful and has brought back Razorback football to highly regarded national recoginiton. There will be seasons with many wins and seasons with fewer wins, but the lessons he and his staff provide these young men is priceless. Thank you Coach Nutt! GO HOGS!!
