The Freelander is buy far the most expensive small SUV's, with a starting price around $25k. I don't know why people think that Land Rover's are something special- the average one isn't reliable at all. This is way over priced. To get a 4 door, 4X4, you'll end up paying over $30k for one. What a rip off, considering the loaded Explorer or Highlander you could get with that. If you are looking at the Freelander just becuase its one of the few small SUV's too offer a V6, look at the Escape also.
