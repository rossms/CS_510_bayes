Hitler was an up-and-coming loudmouth when Max Schmeling won the world's heavyweight championship.Most of Schmeling's friends and his manager were Jews(autobiography,Sports Illustrated article,film-Joe and Max).He saved Jews from a riot(1938-Kristalnaught) and reportedly on the frontier.He was the only German athlete to be drafted;he was a 34-year old Private and Hitler decided he was expendible after he was kayoed by Joe Louis.Germany,which has a tendency to return to its old bad habits,just hasn't had enough Schmeling's.
