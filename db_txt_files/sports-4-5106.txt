I see some very bold claims of his greatness. I remember him playing for the Turtles, recall him being a mighty fine player but I don't think he was one of the greatest ever or better than Jordan. I will say that the Boston Celtics have never recovered since Bias' draft day tragedy. I remember the meanest jokes of 1986 were, NASA: Need Another Seven Astronauts and I hear Len Bias is starring in the 6-foot-under league.
