Our waiter quit during lunch. The pizza, while topped with some interesting combinations, is not any better than anyone else's. This is the most overrated airhead restaurant chain of them all, bar none. Would I wait in line? Why? I can get their overpriced pizza for similarly exotic prices in any supermarket...dumb!
