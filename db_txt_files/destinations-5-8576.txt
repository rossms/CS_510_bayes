I have to say that Grizzly is the best tasteing chew and best way to go money wise. My friends introduced me to the skoal apple and i was amazed by the initial buzz and got hooked. I tried the grizzly wintergreen because it was A LOT cheaper and found the same buzz with a much better flavor. Since, I have tried the redman and a few others but have found that nothing compares to Grizzly wintergreen.
