SO far, this has been the funniest movie of 2003. I do not really care for Will Ferrel's humor. However, he, Luke Wilson, and Vince Vaughn make a dynamite combination. There were many hilarious jokes in the movie I haven't seen a comedy released to theaters in the past two years that I could call funny. Old School restored my faith in current comedies.
