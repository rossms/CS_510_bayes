A nice movie. A bit predictable and preachy. Takes place in 1953 a girls college at Wellesley. the women are groomed to be wives instead of pursuing their own dreams. Julia Roberts Character is the teacher who tries to encourage them to look beyond being a wife and mother. pretty well acted. no big surprises.
