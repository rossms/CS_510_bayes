One of the most awe inspiring places that I have ever visited. I managed to follow the route of the motorcade, up Main Stree, onto Houston and standing directly in front of me was the Texas School Book Depository and the Sixth Floor Window and a right on Elm Street. Standing on the grassy knoll where Abraham Zapruder shot his historic 8mm film. The Sixth Floor, the Grassy Knoll, The Triple Underpass and Dealey Plaza are historic site that everyone should visit.
