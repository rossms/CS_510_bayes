Darien Lake is a nice medium sized park with a pretty decent selection of rides. Some good rollercoasters, an enormous Ferris Wheel (I was told it is the biggest in North America, who knows), and your usual selection of race cars and such. Definitely worth the visit if you're up in the Rochester area and looking for a fun day trip. Not too expensive and a great way to get some thrills on a warm summers day.
