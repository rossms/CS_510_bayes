I think her show is very funny, I watch it every chance I get. She is crass and loud, because she is an original. It's part of a character. I've never seen her talkshow, but from what i read here I'm guessing it's not very good. I'm surprised at all the fat bashing and stuff on this site. People can criticize her acting if they want to, but don't make fun of her cause she's fat. That's just low.
