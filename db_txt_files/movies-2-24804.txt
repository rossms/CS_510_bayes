This is another doomsday thriller. A batch of scientists with a supercollider screw up and work up a black hole that threatens to envelope the earth. Some more techie types have 24 hours to make it all right. A good premise is lost by over the top acting by some of the cast and plain old fashioned scenery chewing by others. The effects are really cheesy, to boot.
