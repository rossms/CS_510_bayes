Good enough. Sandra Bullock did well- it would have been better if she acted more un-feminine in the beginning rather than waiting for other characters to call attention to it. The mystery side of the plot isn't that deep, but the movie has lots of funny characters ( Ms. Rhode Island ), and I was kept entertained.
