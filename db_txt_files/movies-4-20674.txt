I used to think this was the most incredible movie ever made. But when it's shown on TV, it's not that great to me. The difference is that I first saw it in a theatre when it was new, back in the days when theatres had LARGE screens. And this was an unusually beautiful theatre, plus the sound was superb. Even though Angela Cartwright never heard of me, I was desperately in love with her at the time, so I never wanted the movie to end (I think she's gotten old & pudgy like me since then).
