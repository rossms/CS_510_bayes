The 12 years prior to his taking office were some of the worse years in US history. They left a mess (huge deficit, crime, high interest rates, very poor economy, etc.) and he fixed it. Just goes to show you..bigots make lousy presidents. But Clinton is the best ever. Thanks Willie for being human...not a hypocrite like Newt, Rudy, Hyde, Dubyah, etc., etc,. They tickle me.
