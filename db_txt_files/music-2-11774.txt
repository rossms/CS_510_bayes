Lots of the songs on this cd musically sound redundant. I'll admit, Lifestyles of the Rich and the Famous is a great lyrical song. However, that cannot bring enough credit to fill in the gaps of mushy sounding bubble gum punk (which by definition is not punk AT ALL). The rest of the songs follow this same pattern ( The Anthem ....I can't believe that's a part of Madden 2003). It may be their breakthrough to mainstream, but it's no masterpiece by far.
