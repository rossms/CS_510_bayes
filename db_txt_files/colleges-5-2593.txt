Bates is great and yes the Bates Hotel is famous and I have the sign in my window to prove it. But the school is a LITTLE IVY (like Amherst and Bowdoin and Wellesley etc.) It is hard to get accepted and hard to stay in: but, you are more than your SAT's here. SAT's are not required for entry: but, a well rounded person is. The first time you set foot on the quad you know that Bates is the one for you. It takes students no longer than that to fall in love with Bates. The bad thing: You want to stay at Bates for graduate school but must leave as it is an undergraduate Liberal Arts College.
