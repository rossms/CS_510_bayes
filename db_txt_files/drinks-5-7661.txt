I love this stuff! I went on the distillery tour while on a buisiness trip and was blown away by the attention to quality they put into their product. Because it was a Sunday, there were no free samples. So the next day I ran out to get some, and am today (after 2 more bottles) compleatly sold on the fact that it's the best Bourbon on the market!
