This movie truly was a heart-warming movie which made you laugh and cry all at the same time. Sean Penn did an excellent job at playing Sam, a father with an IQ of a seven year old who has his whole world turned upside down when CPS takes his daughter away from him because he is unfit to be a father . It's a lesson that the bond between parents and their children should not be based on intellegence, but rather based on love. Michelle Pfeiffer gave a great performance and was hilarious as the jittery lawyer.
