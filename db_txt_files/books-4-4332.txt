Dante's book on Heaven and Hell is filled with symbolism. It takes a while to sift through it, to figure out what he's saying, but it's very interesting. Interestingly enough, the original was written in Italian, while most works of that period were in Latin. Unless you read Latin or Italian, beware that some of the translation does get lost as often happens, but the book is worth the effort if the myth of Hell interests you.
