Just wondering how many people giving low votes here are Republican and don't like RATM's politics. When this album came out it was like a breath of fresh air in a room fetid with the stench of corporate AOR. I can see rap metal isnt to everyone's taste and can sound a bit samey but at least it has energy and is trying to make a point.
