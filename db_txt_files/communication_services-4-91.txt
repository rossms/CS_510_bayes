I have used AT T for quite a while..have always been pleased. Tried MCI for a while but was too much of a hassle, dealing with two bills, constantly changing rates, etc...$.07/minute all the time seems to be the best and most reliable deal out there..I don't want to be checking the clock when I feel like talking to someone to see which rate applies when..
