I think it depends on where you are. I've bought/received jewelry from Zales in TX, VA, and FL and have been thrilled with everything. My most recent purchase was a sapphire ring online, fast shipping even to FPO, great quality, and good price (I waited until it was on sale). I've had nothing but good experiences with them, online and in store.
