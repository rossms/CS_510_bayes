One of the few FREE outdoor Shakespeare Festivals in the USA. Great mix of local and regional actors, doing the Bard's bidding on a temporary stage in Southmoreland Park. A good number of the audience picnic before the play. Bring your own chairs or rent them at the park. Their website delivers the latest info on dates and times.
