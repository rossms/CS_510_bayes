Friday The 13th is just another low-budget gore fest that wastes it's time on female nudity and blood and guts. Jason Voorhes drowned as a child, but they have found him, and he's dead... or is he? Teens are being slashed and murdered from some woman out there, who happens to be Jason's mother, just to let cha know. And Jason is still alive, it's just that his mother has been cooking up brains and guts for him the whole time and comforting him becuas ethe stupud teens were playing with eachother at the camp not watching the little monsters and he drowns so mom goes mental. I like soft pretzels.
