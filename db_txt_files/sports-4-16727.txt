Indianapolis colts have really helped to build a team spirit for the citizens of Indianapolis. The city is full of blue and white Colts banners, pendants and posters. I wear my 1984 very rare Indianapolis Colts hat to the game once and a while & several people try to buy it. Why is it they have never offered me more than $20.00?
