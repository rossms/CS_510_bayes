Roy Williams has hundreds and hundreds of NCAA wins. Many of those wins are even against great Big 12 teams like Baylor and Kansas State. But as soon as he coaches at Florida State he blows a 26 point lead. And don't even get me started about Clemson. Maybe if Sean May spent more time dunkin the basketball instead of dunkin donuts, the Tarholes wouldn't be below .500 in the ACC for the 3rd straight year. I hope Matt Doherty is laughing.
