Take a few pleasant melodies, jack them up a few decibals, add a little distortion, a touch of intensity, a wicken crew and you have the formula for Godsmack. As hardcore as it may seem, the album has an underlying sense of musical taste that is undeniable. If you need a soundtrack to which to vent, this is it.
