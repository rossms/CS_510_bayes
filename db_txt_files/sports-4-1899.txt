* Never believed in the curse but those that do believe can't really view it as over until Boston wins the World Series. New York had a lot of good players but as a team had too many flaws. Worst crash ever in baseball history. Perfect that it was the Yankees to suffer it. * Will lose to Boston if they make the division championship. Unless you believe in that damn curse.
