I found KC to be a beautiful, cosmopolitan city. Hilly and lots of green. It has the look of an Eastern City with a Southwestern pace of life. I would move here and live in the city. The only downside is downtown doesn't have the shopping I heard it once did. The climate isn't the most desireable but the cost of living is better than other metros areas in the country.
