How could a greatest hits compilation from this band be anything less then excellent? This CD offers a nice snapshot of how U2 has been able to reinvent itself over the years - taking chances with their music, but without losing the core of what makes them a special band. Love them or hate them, you have to give this band respect - they have proven themselves to be one of the most innovative, enduring bands in the history of rock music.
