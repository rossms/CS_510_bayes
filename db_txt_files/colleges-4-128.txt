T-bird is great for someone who wants a tailored, international business program. By attending Thunderbird's overseas campuses, I was able to get real-life international experience while obtaining a graduate business degree. However, I, too, was worried that employers would not take an MIM as seriously as an MBA, but that has not been the case at all. Quite the opposite - I was offered a salary and signing bonus that is equivalent to a Harvard grad's. You may not be recruited by the companies looking for a cookie-cutter MBA grad, but you'll never regret that decision - I'm sure of it.
