The world famous diary of the 13 year old Jewish girl forced into hiding with her family and 4 others in the sealed-off backroom of an Amsterdam building,before her tragic discovery and death at Belsen.An absolutely essential read:not just for its still totally relevant messages about hatred and intolerance, and its remarkable insights into conflicting teenage emotions in such desperately strained circumstances,but above all because it happens to be one of the most absorbing and terribly moving testaments ever written.
