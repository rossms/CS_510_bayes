This series should be read in chronological order, not the order the books were published in. The main character, and some of the others, truely develop as time goes on. I enjoyed it immensely, as it presents one of the most interesting protaganists I have ever read about. Physically handicapped, he uses his mind to accomplish goals most non-handicapped would boggle at. Read it!
