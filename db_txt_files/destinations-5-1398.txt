Most of the negative comments are by people I doubt have ever visited. Were the people in Paris rude? Not any ruder than the people in NYC, Philly or Boston. It's a big city full of self important people. What do you expect? Is it still worth visiting? Absolutely. Paris is the most physically buetiful large city in the world. And the people are actually friendly in the French countryside, which is also buetiful. This is a rating based solely on France as a destination, so the political comments left here seems out of line.
