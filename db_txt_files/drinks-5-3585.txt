The gimlet is an under appreciated, realitvley simple drink (in terms of number fo ingrediants) that is the perfect drink when you want something good and palate cleansing. The sourness of the lime hides the inferiortiy of cheap vodkas but it is best with Chopin or a more expensive vodka. Most people use Rose's lime juice. The right gimlet won't taste sour, will not be syrupy and will go down like water. The only drawback is that the average bartender has trouble with the ratios between juice and vodka. A much cleaner, drier version of a whiskey sour. A must try, and in my case, my second favorite drink.
