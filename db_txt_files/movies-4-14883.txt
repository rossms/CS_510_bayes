I liked Billy Elliot. A feel good movie. An 11 year old boy wants to dance ballet. He has to hide it because his rough coal miner dad would not approve. He becomes quite a good dancer and dad finds out. At first he is disapproving. But then realizes his son has talent is there for his son. Jamie Bell did a great job in the role of Billy. and the rest of the cast is good too.
