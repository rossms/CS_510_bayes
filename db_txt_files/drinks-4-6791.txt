Pretty good, but overpriced. I'd suggest fans of Casa Noble to go their neighborhood Albertsons store and pick up a bottle of Don Viejo Anejo. Its made in the same factory (La Cofradia) and is quite similar, at less than half the price. To me, its also very similar to Tonala, made by Tequilas Finos. Much cheaper as well. I will say the bottle is exquisite -- maybe that accounts for the superlative rating?
