It's a good taste but damn, does it have to flake off so much. That's the only reaon why it's a 4 and not a 5. Every bite breeds a mess. Don't forget, when you get done eating a Baby Ruth, don't forget to look down and check your clothes you might have bits of chocolate/peanuts on it. A real mess when you're inside of a car on a sunny day.
