I do believe if I said anything bad about this movie I would be crucified by all of my friends:) Truthfully, it was quite entertaining in it's own right-and Bruce Campbell's hand getting chopped off was certainly unexpected(and what lovely payoff that had in Army of Darkness). I laughed my ass off when I saw it, and where it isn't one of my favorite movies (sorry guys) it is..well..different. In a good way..Hehe really!Groovy.
