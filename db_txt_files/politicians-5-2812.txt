Oh I LOVE THIS MAN!!! He will one day, rise in the ranks if not the first BLACK President. As a white female...This man gives me hope that our counry WILL come together and ALL be brothers and sisters. I would surely vote and campaign for this man. He does NOT demonize and he is for EQUAL rights for EVERYONE....Go J.C... BJL
