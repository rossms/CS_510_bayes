I've never tried one, but my son just loves them. However, I do think they are very obnoxious to prepare. Cut the plastic off this, slit the plastic on that, remove this completely, heat in the microwave for 2 mins, remove, add this back to the tray, stir that thing, reapply the plastic to this other thing, remove the plastic entirely from the one you previously slit, flip the main entre over, pop it in the microwave for another three minutes, repeat the OPPOSITE of the last 5 steps, stir everything again, allow to cool, serve. Whew!! I would have been better off making a homemade cordeun blue!
