It's a very pleasant, down-to-earth Midwestern kind of place, and from what I could see, Milwaukee seems like an attractive city. If you're ever there you absolutely have to check out the House on the Rock, which I can only describe as the weirdest museum on the planet. If it were in California or on the East Coast it would be world-famous, but nope, it's just out in the heartland; their little secret. On Wisconsin!
