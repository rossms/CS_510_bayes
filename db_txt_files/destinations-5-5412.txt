Ok, im from Metro East St Louis. For those of you who dont know that means i'm just east across the river from St. Louis. Yes Southern Illinois has its fair share of hicks and rednecks, but it is still a great place to live. I have never had any serious problems with people from any area of the state, with the exception of Cub Fans of course. Go Cards
