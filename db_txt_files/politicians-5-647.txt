Russia often produces great people who are subsequently despised by their own people, because they are too intelligent, too sophisticated, too clean. Read Russian history. Russians would rather have Stalin than Trotsky, Yeltsin than Gorbachev. Both Stalin and Yeltsin were corrupt, ignorant, drunken brutes. If Russia had stayed with Gorbachev, they would not be in the mess they are today. Putin is nothing more than a weasely ex-KGB thug.
