It would've been rated a 5 except all of the rumors of Yellow #5 killing of men's sperm and giving a low sperm count. But I love the idea of a young, hip, extreme drink. The commercials catch attention of all teens, relating you to the drink. The taste is unusually different from an ordinary, non-cola. It's sweet and satisfying and quenches your thirst. There is not another drink out on the market like it.
