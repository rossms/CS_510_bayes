This place is a bargain. Most stores nationwide are open 24 hours and open usually during the holidays for some time just in case an emergency shop is needed (which it usually is). The prices are lower than a lot of places, the deli is pretty good, the meat department does an excellent job, and the Kroger Plus Card saves you a bundle.
