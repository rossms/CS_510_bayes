Cornell is great. There is a tremendous variety of course study -- from physics to African studies to viticulture. Most of the students are tremendously smart -- and you have ample opportunity to meet and befriend a wide range of people -- poets, engineers, agricultural scientists. Cornell truly cares about its undergrads -- it is one of the few major research schools that makes its undergraduate education a priority. And it shows.
