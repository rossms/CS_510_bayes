Vienna is a beuatiful city. It has everything, architecturally, from the Schonbrunn Palance to the Hundertwasser House (talk about extremes!). I only spent a couple of days there in 2003, but they were enjoyable, despite the fact that an ATM swallowed my bank card, and the fact that the hotel my wife and I stayed at was one of the worst ever (lousey service,musty bathroom, and more). Food was good, but overpriced. People were basically friendly. I'd like to go back someday and spend some more time there.
