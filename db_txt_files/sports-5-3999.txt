Before the great John Wooden, Adolph Rupp was who all college basktball coaches were measured against. A basketball fundamentalist wonk, Rupp demanded the best from his players. And his players would respond with four national titles. A man from the south, he was a product of the pre-Civil Rights movement. But even Rupp would come to terms and embrace the necessary integration of schools and sport (albeit not for a long time). Given all this, he unquestionably stands amongst the greatest coaches in college basketball history.
