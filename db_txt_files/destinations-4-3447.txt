Boston is amazing culturally - you can walk the Freedom Trail through downtown and see a tremendous amount of American history. The city itself is very attractive, with some beautiful views across the Charles River. The population is young and vibrant - which makes the near-total lack of a nightlife that much more surprising. It is also impossible to find your way around - even while walking, the street names change about five times every three blocks and suddenly twist around to meet a new street. But culturally and historically, this is a terrific city.
