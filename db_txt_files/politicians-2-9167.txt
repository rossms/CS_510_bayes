We got entangled in all our imperial problems under this guy. We acquired Samoa, Guam, Puerto Rico and Philippine Islands. What have these possessions done for the common good? They have cost us billions and tens of thousands of lives defending them. It is even questionable that we should have stolen Hawaii although the Missionary descendents had already stolen it from the native Hawaiians.
