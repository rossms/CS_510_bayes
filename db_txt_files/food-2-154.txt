Good cereal, but the WORST commercials on the planet. When that lady comes on the TV screen wearing the plastic hair net and SHOUTING, I immediately hit mute or change the channel. Please make it stop. The commercials make me want to STOP buying the cereal. June 17: The new commercials are no better. As soon as that obnoxious woman starts shouting: Are you HUNGRY?! I immediately hit the mute button. Please, make her go away.
