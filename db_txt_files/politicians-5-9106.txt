President Clinton was one of our best. I'm proud to have had him in office. I'd vote him in again if he runs. He did nothing politically wrong while in office and that's all that's important. He's extremely intelligent and brought our country to a financially responsible position. Now we'll see what 'W' does with it. I know, he'll blame it on Clinton. . ..
