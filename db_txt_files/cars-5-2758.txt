The Celica, how can we not like this car? It has always been the under-dog of what people really want in a car! So many models to choose, they made one for just about everyone. The amount of torque the old celica's have makes up for the loss of hp. But those new Y2K celi's are amazing. Quick.. so don't go getting yourself in trouble! Clayton http://celica.excelland.com
