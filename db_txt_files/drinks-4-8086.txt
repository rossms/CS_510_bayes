Personally, I find this whisky to be quite good, but nothing compared to the flamboyance and intellectualism of Jack Daniels...many would argue with one, however, and many have. It was always a favorite stolen out of the negligent parents liquor cabinet for high-school drinking fests, sometimes named parties.
