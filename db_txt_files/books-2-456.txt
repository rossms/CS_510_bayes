You may have heard good things about Charlotte's Web, but it is in fact an extremly silly and confusing book, that takes forever to get anywhere. The whole entire idea with a talking pig is extremly goofy, although it was well told in Babe. The only reason why you may want to get aqquainted with Charlotte's Web is if you wanted to see the movie, whihc was very well animated.
