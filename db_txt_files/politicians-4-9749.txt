At the time, I would have suported senior Bush all the way. He stopped a mad man from taking over Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, and eventually the world. Supported by most major countries worldwide. He was a tad bit dull, and didn't do much to help the economy, which is why he didn't get reelected. Still, his removal of Saddam from Kuwait makes up for his losses. He had no idea that Saddam would break all UN and US resolutions, and that the UN would turn around and support him.
