The most delicious fast food I've ever had. The lines always look long, but they move fast, so all you need to do is hunt for a table [there's usually about 5 other peole doing this, too]. I'd kill for some of their fries and an Animalized [or Animal Style] cheeseburger right now. Unfortunately, Minnesota has yes to catch up with the cooler states.
