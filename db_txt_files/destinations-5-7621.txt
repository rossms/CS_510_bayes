I couldn't care less about the inside of the Carter Center - I love it for the lake around back. Jimmy Carter apparently likes animals, so he let's people bring their dogs to swim in the lake. They recently started semi-enforcing a leash law, so dog traffic decreased substantially, but it's still a big dog-party on nice weekend days.
