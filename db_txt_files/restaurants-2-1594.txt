Okay fast food is fast food but gimme a break, KFC was once a great Saturday night treat but have you eaten the stuff recently, drips with fat way to overpriced (especially home delivery items) and the product seems not to venture into a more healthier trend in lifestyles these days. Please lose the fat and for goodness sakes change the menu.
