This game is very big indeed. There are a lot of areas to go to and each area is a decent size. The monsters are fairly decent as well. The downside is that there is only one shop in the entire game. Also I didnt really even buy that much from the shop most of the good items are found on monsters and in the levels and I didnt find it too difficult to level up either. Money was also a little too easy to come by. All in all its an excellent game. Enjoy!
