Nice British movie dealing with the plight of Pakistani emigres living in London and with the many issues they have to address. The lead character, played by Gordon Warnecke, is only incidentally gay and his homosexuality is actually one of the bright spots in his life. Nice understated performance by Daniel Day-Lewis as his supportive punk boyfriend.
