Wrigley field is the mecca of baseball. The Cubs are one of the winniest teams in the history of baseball. I dont see how any true baseball fan could rate the Chicago Cubs in a low fashion. They outdraw many of the other more prominent teams year after year yet Cub fans arent given the credit they deserve. Chicago has the most intelligent fans in all of sports. They truly put the south siders that play at Comiskey park to shame.
