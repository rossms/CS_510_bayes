Totally agree, be careful in this shop!!!!!!!!! We visited the one in St. Thomas and on a lark purchased a diamond bracelet. I had it appraised and it turns out it was lower color grade than we had been told at the store. I have put in a claim and I will see how that works out. Fortunately and by dumb luck at least it appraised for more than we paid for it but would have been better off at Overstock.com! I will never shop with them again.
