starting to see nba potential , now that groin injury is healing...more of a creator type than a shooting guard in the nba likely.....probably not the 6'2listed but heart makes him much bigger...2nd round pick likely per draft experts.......6 years as an nba back up followed by assistant to boeheim and then taking cuse head coach spot......go gmac...continue to make scranton proud
