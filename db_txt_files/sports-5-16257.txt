I've been a Bill's fan since the O.J. years and this year I have decided to solemnly switch to the Chargers!! The past few years have been hard for Doug, but now I have seen what a true team can do for its leader. Doug is going to lead our team to the Super Bowl this season, I ll bet my life on it!! Go Chargers!!!!!
