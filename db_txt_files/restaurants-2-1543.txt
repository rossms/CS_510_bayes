What is it? The training,the staff or company policys that dictate that every KFC that I have ever been to is so consistant, consistatly grubby with unbalievably slow service and always, but always understocked of something on the menu. From someone who in the right mood to be patient realy enjoys the food the finaly served to him. ps Why do they also never ever have any napkins in the dispenser and never ever ever any sugestion/complaints forms in the provision.
