Tubby has made big changes in the UK basketball department. He has focused more on the fundamentals, and thats great, especially defense. I love the way his teams play ball, and I support him 100 % ! GO CATS! Oh yeah and all of you people that say he cant recruit, look at the back court he has coming in. Looks like he beat out Pitino!
