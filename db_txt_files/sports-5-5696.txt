A number of sportswriters have hinted that while Jameer is a nice college player, the only blue chip point guard in the 2004 tourney was Wake's Chris Paul. Bill Simmons went so far as to say that Paul (and Okafor) are the only guys with the potential to be NBA all-stars. However, when Jameer and St. Joe's matched up against Paul and Wake, Nelson destroyed him. I mean absolutely dominated him. He got quality shots whenever he wanted, and outmuscled, outquicked, and outplayed Paul in all facets. Even thought Nelson is likely the player of the year, I STILL don't think he gets the respect he deserves.
