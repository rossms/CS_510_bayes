We have a 1998 EB Expedition and we love it. We bought it new and it has over 70k miles over it with no problems. The only reason it doesn't get a 5 star rating is because the ride is little rough at some points, and it's certainly a gas guzzler. However, you won't find a better, more roomy and powerful ride at a better price.
