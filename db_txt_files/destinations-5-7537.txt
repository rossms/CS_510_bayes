Stone Mountain Park has given visitors many more things to do than in the past. The first time I visited the park, which was in the late 1980's, about the only thing to do was walk up the mountain and ride the Cable Car to overlook the park. Now, with the addition of new attractions, Stone Mountain is definitely a place in Atlanta worth visiting.
