I have only seen a few of her movies. She was great as the mute girlfriend of Sean Penns character in Sweet and Lowdown. I hear she was imressive in the movie about the Irish family coming to America and would be anxious to see that movie. Minority Report was an interesting role for her as well. so far she looks like she has some talent as an actress.
