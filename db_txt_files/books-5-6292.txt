If you're interested in comparative mythology, this book is fascinating. Joseph Campbell's knowledge of myths and religions is both deep and broad, allowing him to draw from hundreds of examples to show how cultures that seem to have nothing in common actually tell very similar stories about the archetypal hero journey. But if you've never read Campbell (or Carl Jung) before, I wouldn't start with this book - I'd start with Campbell's 'Power of Myth,' which is a great introduction to his ideas.
