It was good for one of those EPIC movies(EPIC's arent really my thing), but why did everyone have that bad Brittish acsent? And Orlando(thanks to Boonta I know his name) had the same voice as in Lord of the Rings, which(guess what!) was another EPIC. Men in skirts didnt really help much either. The acting was decent and the CGI looked real. If your a fan of the story, Recommended.
