I've been a Timberwolf straight/long cut snuff dipper for quite some time. It's at least as good as Skoal and doesn't take a such a wad out of my wallet. I just recently tried the new peach flavor and have been very favorably impressed by it's good flavor and total tobacco satisfaction. Good job! Although the straight long cut has been my snuff of choice, peach is rapidly approach my tobacco of primary choice. Again, job well done!
