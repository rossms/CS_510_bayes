I saw this at the cinemas a while a go, and I enjoyed it. the animation was nice and it was fun to watch. If you liked the shorts, you'll probably like this, too. There are some jokes that kids won't get. The story revolves around Wallace and Gromit operating a pest-control business that stops rabbits and other pests from ruining the villagers' vegetables which are being prepared for an annual competition. Soon, an even bigger pest threatens the town and Wallace and Gromit try to stop it from causing any harm. I don't want to spoil anything, but it is a good movie for both kids and adults.
