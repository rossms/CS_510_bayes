Delightful. Finding Nemo has an excellent storyline for today's youth - - they are Fish, but nontheless reflects the common single parent families of today. I also like the way Nemo, the fish-child in question is 'out on his own' but always keeping in mind the values his father has always tried to teach him. Excellent writing.Four Stars.
