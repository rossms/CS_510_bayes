I can't imagine anybody else being President and I wish we could elect him again! No matter who wins in November, I'm going to miss President William Jefferson (Bill) Clinton. He's handsome, intelligent, charming, a communicator without peer and an excellent president. A fascinating person to boot! I LOVE watching this guy!
