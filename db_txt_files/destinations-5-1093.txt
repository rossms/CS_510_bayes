I have been all over Italy many times and I would encourage everyone to go. In particular, you should explore Calabria. It is so rarely seen because few tour companies go there, but absolutely beautiful. The beaches around Vibo Valentia are blue-green and warm, the pace is slow and peaceful, and the fruit is fabulous. Buona fortuna and enjoy!
