Well !! this is the only place where i can custom order khakis . My odd size is 31 waist and 30 3/4th inseam. I personally am very happy with the service. The only blemish is when i ordered a Original Fit Jeans and they send me a completely different fit ( despite the tag on the jeans claiming otherwise ). The Store did give me a refund though. I would ask ppl to try out the website and use the online coupons wherever possible.
