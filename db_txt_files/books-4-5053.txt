This is an impressive book, and it does a good job of using an interesting story to explain Rand's Objectivist philosophy. But it doesn't have the same strong sense of character that drove The Fountainhead. John Galt just isn't as compelling as Howard Roark. If you're a big fan of Rand, it's definitely worth a read. But if you didn't like The Fountainhead very much and you're wondering if Atlas Shrugged is any better, it isn't. Content yourself with one Rand book and move on to other authors.
