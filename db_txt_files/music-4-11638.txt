this is definetly not their best album. the other three before that (hear that JBUT225DU? there were THREE..buddha,chesire cat, and dude ranch..plus they had a bunch of demos one of them being fly swatter. and you call yourself a blink fan???) but back to my point, enemal was ok but the others were better, and yea its true that they were more pop in this one..but who cares blink is blink.
