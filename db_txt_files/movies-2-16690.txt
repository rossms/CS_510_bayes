It really is a cool story - cool enough to make a movie about. But, I'm sorry, this movie did nothing for me. It seemed like it had no driving force behind it. There was no culminating act, no big game or anything like that, which the plot was working toward. It was just a string of situations where "Coach" had to stick up for his buddy, Radio. I was bored after about 20 minutes.
