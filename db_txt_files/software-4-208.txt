I like Safari. It's fast, has a nice interface, and seems to configure Web pages properly. The only real issue that I have is that it doesn't have an icon that indicates that the browser is searching. IEhas the spinning E, and I find that I miss some visual representation of a browser searching for a page. Without this icon, I keep thinking that Safari is locked up, or that it didn't register my click.
