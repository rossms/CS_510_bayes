Prices are not higher than Fry's or Safeway, but the quality is 10 times better. I completely stopped buying produce from other stores, because it turned out to be a waste of money, lots of money. Albertsons is almost 10 miles from my house, 7 Frys/Safeways can be found on my way to Albertsons (icecream melts in summer on the way home, so that I have to go to Fry's sometimes). I gladly drive the extra miles to buy fish that looks clean and doesn't smell like it was displayed for 3 - 5 days. Fry's sucks.
