The first Sonic I ever visited was in Bakersfield Ca. I didn't go for any burgers, I went because my cousin recommended their fabulous real fruit slushies. I have to say I was hooked, for the whole week I was down there I had a slushi a day. I don't live in Bakersfield (who would want to) I live in San Jose Ca. why isn't there any closer? Now I have to wait until my next visit to Bakersfield to have another slushy, and maybe I'll try a burger this time. But dammit make one of those Sonic places closer to my home, because I see the stupid commercials all the time, but there are none in this area.
