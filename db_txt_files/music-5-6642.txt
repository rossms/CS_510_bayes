This is the best record made so far this year. Hell, it's better than any of that crap passed off as music in the '90's. No rapping, no whinny ass songs about how life sucks, just straight in your face kick ass rock. This is the perfect record to play when it is time to get the party started. Long live rock-n-roll and Motley Crue
