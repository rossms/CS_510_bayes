Be prepared to be disappointed. If you're thinking Walden Pond is going to be this nice, quiet, serene place that was the source of Thoreau's inspiration like I did, you're going to be surprised. Not only was I surprised by how big the pond was, (more like a lake), but they've put in a beach house and have allowed people to swim, boat, and do whatever they want to the place. They have gift shops and roads and picnic areas all over the place. So much for simplified, eh?
