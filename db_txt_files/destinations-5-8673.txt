I've only been dipping just under a year and I've tried just about every flavor skoal has, and a few of the cheaper brands like grizzly and timberwolf. My favorites are skoal straight, mint, apple, and cherry. What gets me is all this real men cope and i don't want a tin of candy and skoal is for pussies. It doesn't take dippin' cope to be a man. A man will dip whatever he wants despite the whining of copenhagen guys, who by the way, whether they admit it or not, almost always love skoal apple. UPDATE: skoal peach has quite possibly stolen my heart. it's hard to beat this stuff. just too dang costly.
