Cedar Point beach compliments a beautifully huge amusement park complex on a peninsula and is most indeed an IMMACULATE beach. It is most definitely a 5 star rated beach !!! If you haven't been there then you don't have a clue and it definitely would be totally unfair and unjust to be negatively rating it based on sight unseen assumption !!!
