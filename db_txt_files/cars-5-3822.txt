Own a 2001 XLT V6 4wd in black. Wonderful vehicle. Presently have 19,000 trouble free miles. Use the vehicle to tow water craft, get to the skii slopes and to my favorite fishing spots. This is by far a home run for Ford/Mazda. This vehicle stands up and above the CRV/RAV4/Liberty you name it the Escape is number 1! The only thing I would improve would be the interior, which I hear was already done for 2003...
