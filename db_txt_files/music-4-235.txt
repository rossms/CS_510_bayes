I must say I did start to turn on this album after what, the fifth video? though I did like the second album and some of the third (and haven't heard much after that), I'd have to say no wonder they hated getting famous cause it ruined them. the sound on this album, as well as the lyrics, were fresh, poetic and soulful. The sound was a great blend of sweet and mysterious. I'm sure this album will be considered a classic in 10 or 15 years.
