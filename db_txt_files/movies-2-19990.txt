hmm, if this is the new version, then no, i didn't like it... the whole movie was centered on the effects, they messed up the plot and the acting and EVERYTHING, the version made in the 60s rocked, there was only one effect in the whole movie, besides awesome camera work, and it had a good plot and really worked with the suspense factor...
