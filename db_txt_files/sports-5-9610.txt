Who needs defense when you have this much offense? Certainly not a championship caliber strategy. The aquisition of Jamison will have a good impact, but there is only so much offense to go around. If I were Cuban I'd sell my soul to get a Ben Wallace type player... or maybe you could slip Bradley some steroids... worked for Shaq.
