white castle is an exceptional burger eatery. The burgrers are healthy, as they are steamed, andthe carmelized onions really give those little burgers a unique kick. Plus, I always got amuzement out of eating lots and lots of miniature burgers. And to top it off, big red is on tap here! I wish white castle moved out to massachussetts. I had to go to st. louis to get one.
