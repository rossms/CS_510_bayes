One of my favorite football players today. LT took a crappy NFL franchise and made it somewhat respectable (and made the once dominant Raiders look pathetic). I'm proud to have this guy on my hometown's team. Here in San Diego, he's a household name. His first name is funny but he's extremely dangerous on the field.
