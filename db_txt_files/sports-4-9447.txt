What a great turnaround this guy has made. Everyone thought he would self destruct in the Bienvenidos a Miami party lifestyle, but not only has he stayed away from the sticky icky, but he has developed into one of the best players in the Eastern Conference. When I think of players I wouldn't want to try and guard, Odom is definitely high on the list. 6'9'' with an unbelievable cross over, first step, and strong finish - nobody every doubted his talent, and now his head seems to have caught up to the rest of him.
