The Milano cookies are delicious. I like the Raspberry, Orange, and the Mint ones. I'm not too big on the chocolate ones, but that's just my taste. I have a recipe to make my own, and someday I will, because these cookies, while delicious, are still rather expensive for the few you get in a bag. Overall, yummy!!
