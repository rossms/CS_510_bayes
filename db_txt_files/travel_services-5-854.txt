I don't understand the comments below - Moving Staffers did a great job for our company - We moved over 50 units that were hit by the Hurricane - They did a great job and got it done in just under a week. Full packing and loading services. In looking at the complaints below it would seem most of it is about paperwork of some kind. Their services are set up so that the customers get a screened service provider. I think it was a great service and would recommend to anyone across the country. Dan and his crew went out of their way to help us in the time of need!
