One of the only books I haven't felt cheated by paying more than $25. Sequel to Ender's shadow, this book continues the story of Bean when he returns to earth after the Formic War. Achilles comes back, trying to kill Bean and make a play for power. I expected Peter to play a larger part in this book, but I'm content to wait for him in the next one.
