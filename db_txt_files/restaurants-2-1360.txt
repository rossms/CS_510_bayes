I worked for a sonic for several years in shreveport. I watched customers get spoken to in disrespectful ways by the partner as well as employees. She would threaten customers for having the radio loud or complaining about their service. She would say she would call the police if they did not leave. I remember several emails from the comment line would come in and she would immediately have us write statements changing the story to suit her and email them to the supervisor. Who can trust a corperation that allows a partner to behave in such a way.
