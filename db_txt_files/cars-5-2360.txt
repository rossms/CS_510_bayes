Fast, powerful, and beautiful. It can out perform a good portion of the Ferrari and is the least expensive sports car out today. (Note: Road & Track classified the Viper's as a Super Cars not a Sport Cars) UPDATE: My dad works with a guy who specializes in Dodge Viper repares. He said that there is not much money in repairing Vipers because they don't break. The car is built on a frame built to handle 800 horsepower. The Vipers stock engine is only 500 horsepower (yeah, only). The frame is built for the racing Vipers which have the 800 horsepower engine.
