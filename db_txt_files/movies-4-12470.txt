I love how we as the viewers get to look into two different lives instead just the Bucket's. I'm sure we all wanted to know what made Wonka as childlike as he was. I enjoyed being able to see what Wonka's family life was like. Along with the nuttiness of the movie, it provided a darker side to it as well.
