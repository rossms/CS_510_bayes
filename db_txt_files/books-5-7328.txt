I was the one who suggested this book be put on the list, so I'll be the first to rate it. It is simply a great book. The things he does in this NONFICTION story are unbelivable. It will come as know surprise after you read this book that it was written by the same author as Jurassic Park, my personal favorite. And myself being an author I know that this is a wonderful piece of literature.
