Next to Wilt the Stilt, the greatest basketball player of all time. Next to Bill Russell, the greatest competitor on the B-Ball court of all time. He is the NBA's all-time leader in scoring average. One of the greatest athletes of all time. Not only a stellar basketball, he is a scratch golfer, and was good enough to play Double-A baseball though he had not played in years. Michael Jordan is a once-in-a-generation talent (others in that class are Jim Brown, Babe Ruth, and Jim Thorpe).
