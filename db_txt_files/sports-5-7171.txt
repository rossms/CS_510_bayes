How you can rate Michael Jordan anything but great is beyond me. I have noticed those who have under rated him are unhappy his commercial prowess. Yes he makes commercials and makes a lot of money, but we are not here to rate that, we are here to rate him as a basketballer and there are none better than Jordan. He did things which were unimagineable. Under pressure he took it to the next level and won many games virtually on his own. Those who have voted against him are either bliind, ignorant, jealous or worst of all, racist. I thought it not possible to rate such a phenomenon anything less than GREAT.
