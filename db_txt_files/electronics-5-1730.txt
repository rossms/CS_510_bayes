This model was rated very high in Consumer Report several years ago, and mine has held up really well as predicted. The picture quality is excellent, and I haven't had any problems at all with it (except for the time my dog chewed up the remote control and I had to order another one!). It was also priced very reasonably. My only complaint is that when I'm programming it, I have to watch the date very carefully. It changes with the time, and it's easy to make a mistake.
