they need to trade ladanian tomlinson because hes way too talented and doesnt deserve to get stuck on this team. he had 1600 yards which was more than clinton portis and made all of them behind one of the worst o-lines in the league. also 100 receptions which was more than marvin harrison. theres the only good part of the chargers. they should fire their coach too, he's an idiot who doesn't know how to manage.
