an almost 4.A mocumentary where a few groups of folk singers from the 60s reunite as a tribute to the person who managed their careers. the same cast from Best In show, and Waiting For Guffman, play the several folk groups. It could be quite funny.I read that like the other movies, there is a lot of adlibbing with the roles. all the songs heard were written by the actors which was kind of nice.i liked it for the most part.
