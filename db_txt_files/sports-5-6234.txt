UK KICKS A**, MORE HISTORICAL TRADITION IN THE NCAA RANKS THAN ANY OTHER. MOST IF NOT ALL SCHOOLS HAVE A GOOD RUN AND TAPER OFF AFTER A FEW YEARS, OR EVEN A DECADE, BUT UK HAS BEEN GOING STRONG SINCE 1903. THEY WON THIER FIRST CHAMPIONSHIP IN '48, SECOND IN '49 AND FINISHED FIRST IN THE FIRST EVER ASSOCIATED PRESS BASKETBALL POLL. CURRENTLY THEY HAVE STRUGGLED UNDER HEAD COACH TUBBY SMITH, BUT HISTORY ALWAYS REPEATS ITSELF.GO BIG BLUE!!!!!!
