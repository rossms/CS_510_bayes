Capital of Pernambuco state, that's a happy city. You can apreciate a typical dance called Frevo, danced with colored clothes and a colored umbrella. Has historical value also, and strong influence of dutch colonization, by Mauricoi de Nassau. In the nearby there's another touristic city called Olinda that worth the visit. Forgot to mention the great beaches and the amazing coral formation that names the city.
