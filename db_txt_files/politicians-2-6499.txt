In an impressive GOP victory across the board this election it is also worth noting that Daschle lost. Minority leader goes down. Hard. The democratic party is in complete disarray now. Hillary Clinton may be the standard bearer now. If liberals are smart they will not allow her to become the beacon. Doing so risks alienating the party even further and making it almost unviable. The liberal effort to move further left has been rejected. A complete failure. Will the party wise up and move back towards the center? I doubt it. I expect this party will become more ruthless than ever. Sad.
