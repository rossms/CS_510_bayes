(Rating is based on the movie as it is--I haven't read the book, and I don't really know how close to the book it is, but it doesn't matter). The other Harry Potter movies were pretty entertaining, and this installment was no disappointment. Excellent story and great effects to compliment the movie. If you haven't read the books, this is a pretty good mystery. Worth watching.
