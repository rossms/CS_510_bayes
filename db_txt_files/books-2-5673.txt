Reading this book made me curious about the criteria for the National Book Award. According to information on the cover, the author came to the United States at 16 and is now a professor of English at Emory University. It's entirely admirable that he was able to accomplish so much in a second language. Nevertheless, the language in his book is so limited that it makes his characters sound like poorly-educated children. I wouldn't have waded through to the end if I hadn't been reading it for my book club.
