One of Crichton's elite. This is his fifth best book, which is indeed, very good. It's almost hard to evaluate this book without giving spoiling it, but I definatly suggest this book for anyone who loved Jurassic Park or Congo. Surprised this isn't at the top of the list, but I guess there are two many Grisham and Christie fans out there, which makes me sick. Crichton is by far the number one author.
