the effects and sets were great, and the drama was well done. it was fun to watch tom hanks and his little personal plight, and i even cried when wilson floated away (i never ever cry at movies). but yes the end was frustratingly disappointing. is it just me or does it seem like hollywood is deliberately try to piss us off?
