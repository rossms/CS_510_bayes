It seems as if everyone grew up with Ronny Howard. He portrayed Opie Taylor just as a he was supposed too a good kid without him being too aww shucks or cute, dumb, naieve or just annoying. He was also in the great musical The Music Man. In it he plays a kid with a speech impediment, and although he goes overboard with the lisping, Howard still pulls off the charm.
