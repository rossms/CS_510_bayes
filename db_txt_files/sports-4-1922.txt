I don't like the Yankees, but it's tough to give a bad rating to a team that's won nearly 30 World Series. Let's face it, if any of us were in Steinbrenner's position, we'd be signing Giambi, Sheff, Musssina, and trading for ARod if it meant getting a ring. Maybe it's unfair, but those are the current rules. Be angry at the folks who enact those rules, not Steinbrenner.
