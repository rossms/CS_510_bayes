I have owned a Specialized HardRock for about 8 years. The bike is absolutely amazing, a well oiled machine. I have gone over 2,300 miles on the bike and have experienced relatively no problems. The gears, brakes, and frame were very well built. Besides adventures with my brother on our HardRocks, I also used my bike to train for Iron Man competitions. Well built, sleek looking bikes.
