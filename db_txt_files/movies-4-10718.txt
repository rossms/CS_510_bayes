This movie is a part of my own movie collection, enjoyable over and over again. It's shameless and unappologetic, dumb humour reigns supreme, and yet it all comes together to create a really entertaining movie. Vince actually plays the good guy in this one, a character we usually don't see him playing, which I think mixes things up a little since Ben's character has been seen before. If you are just in the mood to shut your brain off and laugh, this is the film to see. F'n A, Cotton, F N Aaaaaaaa...
