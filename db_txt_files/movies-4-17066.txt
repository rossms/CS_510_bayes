Why anyone would rate this film lower is beyond me. Yes it is kind of trashy, just look at the subject matter, but it tales a very gritty story about the lives of these women. Sandra Oh and Jennifer Tilley give excellent performances.... Yes I said Jennifer Tilley gave an excellent performance..... stop laughing...... really. It is a tough movie on a tough subject. If you are open minded enough to watch the movie without making judgement based on the subject matter it is enjoyable.
