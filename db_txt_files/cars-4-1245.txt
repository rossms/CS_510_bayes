I Love my 1998 Altima, no problems, has 60000 miles. But my gas mileage is terrible. I'm getting 17 mpg and I don't know why. I really would like to get an answer to this because I'm going to the gas station more than I should be. If you have any solutions of suggestions please e-mail me at laxn103@aol.com
