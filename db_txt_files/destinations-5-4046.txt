 Tucson is a great city and I had a blast there when I was there about 10 months ago. There still are plenty of hippies and Punkers around and the nightlife is indeed thriving. The Hotel Congress and Plush were my most frequent stops when I was there. It is also the home of the hippest band in America today, Calexico!
