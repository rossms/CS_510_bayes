One of the great clutch players in ther history of the game and a guy who would never stop moving for the entire 48 minutes. Was also drafted by the Cleveland Browns (even though he never played football at Ohio State.) Hondo was a link to the great Russell led dynasty and also led his own group (with Dave Cowans, JoJo White, Don Nelson, Paul Silas...) to a couple of championships in the seventies. He could play all phases of the game and until the great players that emerged in the Bird-Magic era of the 80's and 90's was arguably among the top ten players ever to play.
