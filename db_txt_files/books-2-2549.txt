I haven't looked at this comic strip for years, since Ms. Guisewite felt a need to criticize then-sitting-President Reagan. I don't remember the exact topic, but as a die-hard conservative I did not appreciate little Ms. Cathy's editorializing, and the same goes for Rosie Odious O'Donnell and many of her stinkin' liberal buddies. They are free to speak their (tiny) minds and we are free to refuse to listen to their whining. Being a celebrity doesn't make you an expert, and there are abundant examples of that in Hollyweird, as well as in the printed media.
