the final installment in a trilogy of movies that i consider to be the only true muppet movies. while not new like the muppet movie nor as elaborate as the great Muppet caper the Muppets take Manhattan has a charm unto itself. C'mon Miss Piggy and Kermit get married at the end--thus putting final scene in their stories relationship--hell, it's a better ending than return of the jedi also i always get the phrase ocean breeze soap--will get you clean in my head.
