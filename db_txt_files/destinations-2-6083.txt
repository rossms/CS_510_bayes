The 2 stars are for Lake Tahoe area. Other than that, the rest of the state is a desert and/or nuclear waste dump. Las Vegas may be the worst idea for a city, like, in history. A place where people who cant afford to come to gamble their money away. Of the largest metro areas in America, Las Vegas has the fewest adults with a college degree, which explains why they are there to begin with. Not too bright. Maybe the aliens living at Area 51 will get into government office somehow and re-make the place.
