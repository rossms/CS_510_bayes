Skoal is by far one of the best types of smokeless tobacco. It is great to put a dip in when fishing or just hanging out with the guys. I dont know why Skoal made vanilla to me didnt only taste wrong but it also sounded wrong. The pouches are very nice besides they lose flavor to fast. The best flavor that skoal has out there that i have tried would have to be cherry but i heard they have fruit punch and blueberry. I have yet found any place to by these two types in Janesville. Last thing i would have to say is the new tops work great to keep the chew fresh
