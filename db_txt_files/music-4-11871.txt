A magnificent CD. I give it fours stars only because like Springsteen's The River, an effort this sprawling almost has to have one or two false starts. There are some forgettable tracks and Isn't She Lovely is an early indication of the overly sentimental turn Wonder's music would soon take. But the highs are numerous and wonderful. They are songs that simply are not to be forgotten. Love's in Need of Love Today, Pastime Paradise, Ordinary Pain, I Wish, Sir Duke, As, and Black Man are only some of the stellar cuts on this double CD.
