I went to one back in 2002 in Montgomery, Alabama and it had bad service. The watriess was pretty mean. They were out of soda and I could only drink water. I only got a little bit of food 'cause the rest was covered in Mustard(which I really hate) and my Aunt talked to the waitress and we all left with a frown on our face. And whatever you do. Never come here( unless you know this Shoney's has good service). The food was okay also.
