I hate the commercials where the Italian-American family takes their mom or dad to Olive Garden right after they just came to visit from Italy...like that's where they would want to go after eating all that great authentic Italian food back home. The food is ok but you're really paying for the decor and unlimited breadsticks. The sauce is definitely from a can and the food never tastes fresh from the oven. There is another place in my hometown called Johnnie Carinos, much better Italian food and it is fresh. You know because their kitchen is in the back of the dinning area for everyone to see.
