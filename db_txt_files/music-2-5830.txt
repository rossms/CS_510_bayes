It is my pleasure to knock this record down below 'Ziggy Stardust' by David Bowie. I am even an outside admirer of Motley Crue, but this record just is flat out bad. On this record they have energy, but not a hell of a lot of talent. Mick Marrs has and always will be one of the scraiest life forms to look at.
