It tastes like water to me - the reason that I like Aquafina is because I like the oversized mouth (is that the right word?) of the bottle. I'm not exactly sure why I like this aspect - it may be because the bottle feels sturdier, or it may just be because it reminds of dark but happy days drinking Mickey's Big Mouth malt liquor. (and yes, when it comes to stuff like water, packaging is a big deal.)
