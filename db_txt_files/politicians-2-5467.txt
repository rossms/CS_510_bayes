i respect john kerry's service to his country in vietnam, but i am more than a bit uncomfortable that his service is playing such a large part in his campaign. his political career and the traits of his character are more influenced than his opposition to the war when he returned home than the short time he was in vietnam. his 20 years in the u.s. senate reflect more the ideals of an anti-war protester than of a decorated veteran.
