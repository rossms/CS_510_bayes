The Cabo Wabo Anejo Tequila is incredibly smooth, with loads of flavors, and a terrific finish. The best Tequlia I have ever had. The Cabo Wabo Reposado Tequila is a close second. However, the Cabo Wabo Silver Tequila is not one I would recomend - not at all smooth and leaves a not so pleasant aftertaste in the back of your throat.
