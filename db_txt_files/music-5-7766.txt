Even today, 'Free Falling' serves as one of Tom Petty's masterpieces. The lyrics are easy to follow, and the tune is unforgettable. As for the music video, it can be said that though it was rather cheesy. But it also represented the Southern California skateboard scene, complete with the visuals and the beautiful girls which positively define California.
