I rate Bombay Sapphire a five because even if some people don't like the taste of gin, one has to rate it in context, as far as gin goes Bombay Sapphire is good gin. The high proof of the alcohol is also a plus because one only has to take a minimal number of shots to get the same effect as less potent alcohol.
