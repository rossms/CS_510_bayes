I hope, I hope for America, that someone with the moral fibre of Hillary Clinton gets elected as president. Interesting characterization of her as a dominatrix earlier on. That is really the fear of the right wing - a strong woman and an independent thinker. You show them, Hillary! Update: on moral fibre (or fiber): moral fibre to me is a blueprint for the way we lead our lives, based on an inner sense of right and wrong. It is an individual quality and it only has relevance when our actions match that blueprint.
