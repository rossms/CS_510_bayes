The cool thing about these is that they are made fresh and you can see the whole process. They put one up in a town near me, Newington Ct, and there were actually people camping for days to be the first customer (the prize was a years supply of donuts). The town had to hire 3 cops for a few months to direct all the traffic. Any donut that can attract this type of attention is worth trying.
