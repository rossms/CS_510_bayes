Am I the only person who can't stand Susan Sarandon? And what are people thinking when they say she's good-looking? Are you all seeing the same bug eyes I am? I'll admit that she seems to have acting skills, but there's something so irritating about her that I can hardly watch. Bull Durham, for example, was a good movie. But Sarandon tainted the whole thing thing for me because I found it impossible to believe that two sane men would compete for her. Why not compete for the chance to shave your head with a cheese grater?
