Best place to call home (and I've lived all around North America). Half the rain of Vancouver and Seattle. Arbutus trees and garry oaks, rather than dreary evergreens of everywhere else nearby. Great selection of restaurants for a city of it's size, beautiful neighbourhoods where people care for their homes and gardens. No real commuting. World class university. A symphony. Genuinely friendly people, not a lot of pretence.
