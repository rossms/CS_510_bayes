This movie feels like an extremely long trailer for a movie that could've been good. It is filled from start to finish with special effects, explosions, and one liners designed to hold the attention of a mindless audience. There are no surprises and nothing new to see here. Watch 'Deep Impact' for a thoughtful movie along the same lines.
