I completely agree with musicfan - London is the best! Exciting, full of life, history, great old buildings, museums, and theatre. And, yes, one of London's most outstanding features is the people - truly the most considerate I have ever encountered in a large city. That's saying a lot about their culture and patience when you consider how many tourists file through every year!
