Can ya vote for a country if you've never actually been TO it in person? Well, I love their furniture -- rugs, tables, tiles, etc. and have some of these things in my own apt. I also like their music and food. There is this GREAT little Moroccan shop on Polk Street in San Francisco. I will go out of my way to watch documentaries, travelogues, etc. on Morocco....
