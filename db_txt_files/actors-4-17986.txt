Hunter does very well with her character of Taylor on B B, as a loving wife to Ridge, and a loving mother to Stephie; she's a rare good girl in soaps, one of the characters that leave you wondering what she's doing in a world of wackos... well, she gets picked on often by the likes of Brooke, and as of late, evil Morgan. In any event, she does well with her too-good-to-be-a-soap-character Taylor.
