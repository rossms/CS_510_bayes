I also have been with netflix for a year,,always got the dvd's they sent but when i sent them back they never recieved them,, first i thought it was the post office,,but then i realized that it was new releases that were being recieved,,i rent alot of foreign movies,, i would say i have rented 100 movies from netflix and 6 were stolen out of that 6 5 were new releases,, i very raily rent new releases from netflix,however the problem surely exists in house,, i will not pay for something that i returned,netflix better clean up there act or they will lose another customer
