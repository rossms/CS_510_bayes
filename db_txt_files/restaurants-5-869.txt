The Subway I go to is fantastic! The store is always clean, it smells clean and the staff is super nice. The sub is always made just like I ask. Some people on here have said that the portions are small. Do you know that a footlong coldcut has 6 ounces of meat on it?? That is a huge sandwich considering most burgers are only 4 ounces and don't have nearly the veggies a sub has. My favorite is the turkey or roasted chicken. The bread is always fresh and soft. I agree that it is pricey, but no one eats out every single day.
