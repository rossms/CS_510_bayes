BUT I have never forgiven him for the fiasco of Mrs Doubtfire's rapid mask face change - the movie had been believable (just) but then - oh dear! I think it comes from knowing how long it must have taken to get that makeup on - then, to expect me to believe he could whip it on and off with no ghastly edges showing - sorry - it, and Robin Williams, lost me there!
