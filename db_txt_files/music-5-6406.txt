I wasn't very familiar with ALice before a few months ago. Don't get me wrong I knew he was a legend and all and had heard the hits but didn't own an album by him, until my buddy bought me Brutal Planet as a gift. Wow! This thing rocks as much as any of the 90's bands I dig so much. Take a chacne on this bad boy. I went yesterday and bought a couple of more Alice albums, and Ihaven't had a chance to listen to them yet, but I am sure they rock!
