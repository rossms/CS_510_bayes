I enjoyed this film. The length could have been cut a bit I think though. It's a rather bleak story, with Pitt playing Death, who enters the life of Hopkins telling him his time is up, but delays the innevitable for a tour of his life. They end up best buddies. This film is charming with a bittersweet tale of life and death. Plenty of tears along the way, with a few added smiles. I recommend this one for something completely different.
