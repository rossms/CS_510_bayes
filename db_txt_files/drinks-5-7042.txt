Another very good tequila I had the opportunity to taste and eventuall bought 2 bottles back from Cabo San Lucas. I truly enjoyed it it and share it with my son, my nephews and their friends one evening while smoking a good cigar. this drink has a excellent taste and lite burn that is pleasing to the palate.If i had to chose tequias this one would be near the top.
