Richard Gere did notact at all. He mumbled his words. the last time that he acted wasin Officer and a Gentleman. Winoa Ryder needs to have some sort of energy other than depression to act with. Where did they get this story? Richard Gere has aged considerably since he met and started living with the woman and her child...so where is the child's father in allowing his daughter to be subjected to a live in boy friend and an illegitmate child? His movies are now a joke.
