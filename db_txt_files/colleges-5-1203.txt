Unquestionably the best school in the country. Don't believe all of the stories about New Haven. It is actually a great town (with far better restaurants in the immediate vicinity than Harvard Square!) Amazing classmates, World famous professors (who actually talk to you!), and a low-pressure, diverse social life--what more could you ask for?
