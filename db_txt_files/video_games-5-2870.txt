I was excited about GTA:SA since I first heard of it. I bought this the day it came out and it did not dissapoint. It is the most in depth GTA yet. Many of the bugs from previous games have been fixed for the most part, adn the absnce of loading screens adds to the realism. Although I don't play much anymore, I'll still give it a run now and then. Great game.
