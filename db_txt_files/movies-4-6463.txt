To quote Charleton Heston TOUCH OF EVIL is unquestionably the greatest B movie ever made. Well, if you don't count PSYCHO as a B movie, then TOUCH OF EVIL is the greatest of all B pictures. This film shows why Orson Welles is a true genius, even in his final years. His acting is absolutely superb here as is Janet Leigh's, but I think that Heston was horribly cast as a Mexican. He didn't look, sound or act like a Mexican. But he gave his best which in the end is good enough, I guess. Great movie.
