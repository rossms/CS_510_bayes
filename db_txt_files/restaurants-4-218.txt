I'm deprived of Chik-Fil-A, since we don't have them here in Nebraska or over in Iowa. I remember them from living in St. Louis and from visiting in Ohio and Texas. The chicken is great- plump, juicy and the breading is delicious, with a great blend of spices that aren't too overpowering. I also like the waffle fries -something different! I hope Chik-Fil-A plans on expanding to the Midwest more so we can enjoy their great food!
