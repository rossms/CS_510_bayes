I have often seen Gap window displays, gone inside to find the clothes that were displayed, then been told that they don't carry the clothing in petite sizes. What is worse, they try to talk me into settling for something that doesn't fit. I didn't take the bait, but I thought it was unethical. I have learned that Gap is a waste of my time. Their prices are very high for what you get, plus, they ignore a segment of the market (women 5'4 and under).
