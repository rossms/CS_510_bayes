I used to like her but now she just annoys the crap out of me. If she just would have not been so obsessive about her acting career she would be the one having Brad Pitt's kid, not Angelina. Oh well. She is a decent but at best a one-dimensional actress who is better and more believable in silly romantic comedies than dramatic roles.
