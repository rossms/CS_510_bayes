Great for tourists just looking for some pretty beaches and good shopping. There are plenty of shows to go to such as in Honolulu there is the magic of polynesia show which is hula, fire dancing and magic all rolled into one. Its a good way to see some great hula without the cheesiness that comes with luous.
