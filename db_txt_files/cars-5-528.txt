HARLEY DAVIDSON... ISN'T THAT THE ONLY TRUE RIDE.!!!! THE DAY I RODE A HARLEY, I WON'T RIDE ANYTHING ELSE. THE SOUND, THE RIDE, IS ALL I NEED. I USE TO RIDE ALOT WHEN I WAS YOUNGER. MY SON USE TO LAUGH AT ME, WHEN A HARLEY WOULD PULL UP NEXT US AT A STOP LIGHT. THE SOUND WOULD SEND CHILLS ALL OVER ME.
