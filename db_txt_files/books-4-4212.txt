An interesting book yet Salinger is too occupied by the elusive nature of childhood innocence. Similar to virginity, Salinger believes innocence once lost can never be regained. Holden Canfield spends his time in the book looking for his innocence. Ultimatly, however, he ends up in a mental institution. Read this only if you have the time. Although it is short, some parts are difficult to transverse.
