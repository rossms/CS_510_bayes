Fine, well-crafted film. It helps if you're a Catholic when viewing this picture, although it's not completely necessary. Edgy, baptism-by-fire drama that streches the viewer's mind in numerous, sometimes uncomfortable directions. While the film certainly doesn't provide you with THEE answer (just many more questions than you had before), it does however offer keen insight into the phenomena of exorcisms - how and why they are carried out - and what they specifically encompass.
