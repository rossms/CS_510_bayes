I remember these being recommended to me two years ago, and I really enjoyed them. I think I only read two books out of the series, but both were interesting because of their complex stories and the Welsh culture brought into it all. I didn't get into the Redwall series, or those 5,000-page David Eddings novels, but The Dark is Rising series was exciting and interesting when I was in the right mood. I should read them again sometime.
