Not as interesting as Bangkok but definitely trying hard to be a "world class" city. Formula 1 racing, the highest twin towers in the world, a skytrain mass transit system and they hosted the Commonwealth Games ... and with a generally well educated, English speaking population. And only a couple hours from Penang, a really wonderful place. Good luck to KL, have been a few times and will return again someday ... my wife loved the Cha Kwa Teoy (fried noodles) and would return for that reason alone.
