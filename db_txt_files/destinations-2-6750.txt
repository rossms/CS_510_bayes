Orcas, Idaho, Idaho, and then there's Coeur d'Alene Idaho. I've been here 5 years, there is more then enough unhappy people here to almost go around the World. I felt better after visiting someone in the retirement home, what's wrong with that picture? That pretty much sums it up for me. Two more years to go then I'm out of here, my kids also can't wait to leave, they say there teachers seem grumpy most of the time. See Ya!
