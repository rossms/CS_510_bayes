Solid, lovely actress who has shown some remarkable range in her acting skills - she can carry a romantic lead(At First Sight), comedy(Mighty Aphrodite), and even action/suspense(Mimic/ The Replacement Killers). As an Oscar-winning actress she falls just short of the top drawer of Hollywood actresses, but she is a major force to be reckoned with in the Biz, and has all the beauty, talent, and charm in the world. This cow expects many great things from Ms. Sorvino, hopefully very soon!! :=8D
