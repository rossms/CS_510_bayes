The most accurate passer in football. Great leader!! Led his team to the playoffs his first year starting only sputtered against the Raiders in the divisional playoff game. (Im worried about his big game poise a bit because of this but in other games he has seemed to master the moments) Last year he was injured and it killed the Jets chances of making the playoffs. He also lost his #1 go-to guy in Laverneous Coles. This year he's got a new big receiver target and has Chrebet back. I think this is Chad's breakout year!!! All Pro leading his team to the playoffs. 11-5.
