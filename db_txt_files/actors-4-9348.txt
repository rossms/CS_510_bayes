An icon who lives her own life and even had a 'stage mother' named Brandy! Jodie Foster was so great in Taxi Driver that nothing that came could top it. Can be great (Hotel New Hampshire) average (the Accused) less than average (Silence of the Lambs) and downright embarrasing (Nell) and will all the dykes out there leave this woman alone already ! Just because she was anything but convincing as a wife to Richard Gere ! in Sommersby does not make this woman from the Isle of Lesbos........
