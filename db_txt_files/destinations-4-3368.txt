DC's not a bad place. The museum and monuments are cool but not really my scene. I like how there's the ordinance that no building can be higher than the Washington Monument. Makes the city seem a bit less overwhelming than others. People seem a bit courteous of our Capital and don't use the horn much or drive like idiots. The subway system is extremely clean. There are some great colleges, and the club scene is a good time.
