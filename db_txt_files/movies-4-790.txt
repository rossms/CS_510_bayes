This is one of the best psycological thrillers since The Silence of the Lambs . I decided to try Wiggum's Bathroom Test when watching this film, and in fact not once did I leave this movie to go to the bathroom so I didn't miss anything. It dragged on at parts, but the acting was supurb and made up for the few errors with the plot. I've never seen a performance as phenominal as that of Hayley Joel Osment. I reccomend this to anyone who likes creepy psycological thrillers because espescially towards the ending it will blow your mind.
