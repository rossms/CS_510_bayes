OH MY GOSH I LOVE THESE THINGS!!! I had had them once or twice when I was the movies when I was little, but didn't get truely addicted until they were available in the vending machine at my high school. I've literally bought the WHOLE row out at one time. I eat them during class....whenever I have them avaailable. I mean I even got Junior Mints Socks off E-bay. I am the ultimate addict. I even EXCITED KNOWING that I have them! In some ways it's kind of pathetic, but I don't care because I LOVE MY JUNIOR MINTS!!!! :D
