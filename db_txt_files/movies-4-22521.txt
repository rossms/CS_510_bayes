Interspersed with a few good moments (Arnold's answer to what is best in life is priceless), yet I always wanted more from this movie. The Governor of California was a no-brainer for the hero, but I pictured him in a darker, more-savage storyline. A well-known crowd pleaser robbed of its thunder by a dippy sequel.
