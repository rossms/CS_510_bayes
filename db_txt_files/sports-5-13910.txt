Sanders was not only the greatest Running Back to ever touch a ball but he was also a true role model and professional. Never once has he done an endzone dance or celebrate in any way. He simply did his job phenominally, broke the plane of the goal line and handed the ball to the line judge and trotted back to the sideline.
