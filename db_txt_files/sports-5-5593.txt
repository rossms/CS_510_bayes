Mccants is an unbelievable offensive talent. In terms of offensive prowess, he is uncomparable to any other player in the country. He is the one player that every coach preps for. He scores inside, he scores outside, and will lead carolina to teh final four. As of this year his defense has been intense, and his attitide great, if this continues, we are looking at teh national player of the year and a top 5 NBA DRAFT PICK. (dont agree, remeber ben gordon went 3rd last year.)
