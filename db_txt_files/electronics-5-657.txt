Very nice phone. Lots of features, (almost too many) pleasant shape and size. It's also reasonably priced which is amazing considering how these things go. I had a Sony Z phone before this and although that is smaller and in some ways niftier it cost more when I bought it and doesn't have nearly as many features.
