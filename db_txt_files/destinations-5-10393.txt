Newports are an amazingly good cigarette. I started out smoking parliament lights, and smoked about six or seven cigarettes before I fell in love with them, but ever since then, I have been a loyal newport smoker. Anyone who rated newports anything below a four, hasn't smoked more than one or two newports. Smoke a pack, and you'll never go back.
