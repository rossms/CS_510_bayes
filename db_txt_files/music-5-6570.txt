Even though I give this a 5, I have to say it is not their best album. Captin Crash the Beauty Queen From Mars is good proof that the band is going down hill. They are still a great band but don't expect this album to be as good as their earlier stuff. When I first listend to the album I didn't really like it too much, but after I listened to it three or four times it grew on me. I'm listening to it again right now and I'm starting to like it a little more. It's definitely worth giving it a try.
