Total chick movie and I may regret leaving this comment, but I thought it was a really good movie. I lost some bet with my girlfriend back in college so she got to pick a movie that I had to go see with her. I got ragged on pretty heavily by all my buddies back then for even going. No way I could admit liking it. But I did, it was really a compelling movie. Mary Stuart Masterson was great in the film that chronicles the lives of two women gaining their independence in the backwards South way before this idea was even thinkable.
