Dreyer's has great premium (full fat) ice cream. Dense, creamy with all the right flavor notes that justify its slightly higher price. You'd expect Dreyer's to be rated similarly to Edy's on this list, since they are the exact same product. The ice cream is called Dreyer's Grand in the Western United States, but is marketed as Edy's Grand east of the Rocky Mountains. Their corporate parent also owns the Haagen Dazs brand (which is a fake German name), another great product line.
