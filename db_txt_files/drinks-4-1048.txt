Had the opportunity to sample this ale at length on a trip to Ireland. It was a good alternative to the heavy, bitter guinness, which I like but can't drink all night. We illiterate Americans pronounced it schmiddix or something like that, but the omniscient bartender took care of the language barrier for us. We tipped him like the linguist he was.
