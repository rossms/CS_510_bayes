When this movie came out and the tv show followed, like everyone else I wondered if students actually acted like that at this NYC high school (which DOES really exist). Of course, they didn't but that didn't change the fact that the actors playing the roles were incredibly talented. From the dancers to the singers, these kids were great. Debbie Allen was also top-notch as the demanding teacher.
