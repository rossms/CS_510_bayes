I've heard this all before. Lady Marmalade's been done by other artists so many times before and now its just dull and repetitive. What's up with Missy Elliot? Ughhhhh......Christina, ughhhhhh......Pink, ughhhhh.....Lil'Kim, ughhhhh.....Mya? That's all she says. Why is she even featured on this song?
