CODE RED CODE RED!! it's in my veins i drink it most every day how can any human not enjoy it? low fizz so you can slurp it without getting it up yer nose after yer little bro throws it across the room and down the stairs. tastes great warm or cold tho not really hot best when ice cold but without ice cause water waters stuff down. available most everywhere to civilization. red is an awesome color for a drink and cherries are good too. if you don't like the code red why are ya here in the first place? go find smthng constructive to do rather than spread slander against the awesomeness that is code red
