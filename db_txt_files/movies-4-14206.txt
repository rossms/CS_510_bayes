I really, really, really, wanted to hate this movie. I tried to hate this movie. It has several things I hate: talkative old geezers, Hanoi Jane, and a smartass know-it-all teenager. I thought for sure I would flush it down the toilet. . .this film is well-written, great characters, and a great tribute to Henry Fonda. A very good film that I have to respect.
