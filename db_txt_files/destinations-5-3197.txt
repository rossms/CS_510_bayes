San Diego is a very stimulating place to visit. It has a number of great beach communities each with their own atmosphere. La Jolla is very scenic locale with trendy shops and restaurants, rocky and sandy shores. Downtown is decent and fairly clean and Balboa Park is very impressive with nice archetecture, a lot of vegetation, the world famous zoo, and a nice collection of museaums. I much prefer San Diego to Los Angeles as this is the part of Southern California I would come back to visit again.
