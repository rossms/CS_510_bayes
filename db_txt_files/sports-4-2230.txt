This team has played well below expectations in 2003, but as a rule they've been a slow-starting squad for the past few seasons. A spirited group that keeps coming at you. Very solid starting rotation and an offense that can hurt. 2003 should wind down as a very interesting season in the AL West, as this team, Oakland and Seattle appear to be the best three teams in the Junior Circuit.
