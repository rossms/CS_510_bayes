The first in an overly long series of braindead slasher films.This is far and away the best in the series.My only problem was with the fact that the killer is not introduced until very well into the movie.For those who have not seen this the plot revolves around a camp reopened after having been closed down after a negligent drowning death.A restless spirit or a human is out for revenge and starts killing off the camp counselors.
