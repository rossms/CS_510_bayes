I was in a fairly shakey frame of mind when we put this in the VCR, and I wasn't sure I'd get into it very much, what with it being a comedy and me not feeling very much like laughing. However, I must say that I enjoyed it quite a bit. The lead characters had winning personalities and the dialogue was quite funny at times. Of course, it slides into predictability at times, but there aren't many movies lately that don't. It's well worth watching and I'm considering buying the DVD.
