Eh. . .too far for me to want to travel there, although I do admit to wanting to travel along the Columbia River and through the Valley. Seattle recently had an earthquake, didn't they? And it rains a lot up there in Seattle, too. Not only that, but too many people have moved there, and I really don't want to be where things are trendy, like California, or Georgia, or North Carolina, etc. I agree with Washingtonians when they don't want Californians or other outsiders moving there. I'll oblige them by visiting, but not staying.
