Ronald Reagan will go down in history as one of the most effective presidents ever. I was in my teens while he was in office and remember the wonderful speeches he gave. He was a very charismatic person who was very influential on an international scope. He was fortunate to have served in office during the 1980's and he was much more effective than that boob Jimmy Careter. We can thank Mr. Reagan for taking a stand against Iran and ending the Cold War with the Soviet Union. There was nothing cynical about this man.
