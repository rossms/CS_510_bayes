One of the best not above and beyond everyone else. He won alot of titles but not against a team of players who were good enough to go on and win a title themselves. Magic and Bird beat teams who even in their defeat could be considered one of the best assembled. In fact teams that did regroup to win titles themselves. Jordan is a 5 star guy for sure but he's not standing on top alone. Magic probably could have gone to the Hall-of-Fame from any position.
