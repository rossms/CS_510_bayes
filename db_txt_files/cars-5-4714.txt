I owned a '99 Sport (with the 16 5-star rims and firmer suspension), and I loved this truck. I had to trade it in for a mini-van, though, to accomodate my growing family, not a family friendly truck. Nonetheless, still a great looking truck with no problems. Not very powerful or roomy, but for good transportation with great gas mileage, this is my fav. Never let me down when I needed it to get through bad weather or with mid-size loads.
