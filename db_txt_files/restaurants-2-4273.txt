HARD TO CHOOSE BETWEEN BAD AND TERRIBLE WHEN THE FOOD WAS COLD EVEN THOUGH IT HAD BEEN RETURNED TO THE MICROWAVE ONCE TO MANY TIMES. SAUCE WAS NON EXISTENT. WE HAVE EATEN AT THIS MACARONI'S ON SEVERAL OCCASIONS AND THIS WAS TERRIBLE. THE REATAURANT IS ON HARBISON BLVD, IRMO, SC. WILL THINK A LONG TIME BEFORE WE EAT THERE AGAIN.
