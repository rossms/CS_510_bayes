smaller than disneyworld, but great! lot's of fun rides, eateries, etc.! if u are in/visiting CA, u MUST MUST visit disneyland! well worth ur $$!! Note: Now, they've had this for about a year, everyone...they have FAST PASS. FAST PASS allows you to come back later(once u get a ticket, to). U can LITERALLY fly by lines!! it's great. so, say u get ur fastpass at 1:00. It says come back between 2 and 2:15(or whatever). u can go ANYWHERE for 1-2 and then come back and go on a SEPERATE line and go on the ride that u got that 2:00 FASTPASS for! see? it's awesome!!
