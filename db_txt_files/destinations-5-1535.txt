I've been to Japan! It's great! I was in Nikko which is beautiful. There's so much to do in Japan. Xenophobic? Not really. There are a lot of Filipinos and Israelis who have moved there now. The Japanese are also extremely polite people. From the fun anime videos Sukeban Deka and Colorful to the great bands Malice Mizer and Dir En Grey Is there anything Japan can't do? CharmingPrince made a bigoted and nasty statement. It insults the good people of Japan. Kamimura Ukyou was a great guy. A kind man. He was not a snake!
