House of Sand and Fog is like a modern day Greek tragedy. This is more than a fight over a simple house it's a clash of cultures. This is not a happy story. Andre Dubus does an excellent job of detailing the two main characters, and not making the one more likeable or the reader more sympathetic toward one or the other. Each character has his or her reason for doing what they are doing.
