Criminally underrated actor, always puts forth his best effort even when the movie in question is not all that good. Possesses a sinister voice. Probably best known for "Die Hard"and his role in the Harry Potter flicks, but he ought to be given more high profile roles IMO. He was particularly good as Eamon De Valera, the first president of the Republic of Ireland in "Michael Collins", though that film as a whole, while pretty good, was flawed by the ridiculous appearance of Julia Roberts!
