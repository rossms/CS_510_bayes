My favorite city to visit in the US. Beautifully laid out. Seemingly endless number of musuems/landmarks/tourist attractions, both public and private. Diverse population. Best transit system in the US in my opinion. Nice 4 season climate. Gorgeous suburban Virginia and Maryland countryside. Highly recommend a couple visits to the nation's capital.
