I like John Kerry. I believe he can get our country going back in the right direction. Do I think he will be able to do this overnight? No. There is a lot of damage to repair. I am passionately in favor of him winning. True, he is not a riveting speaker. Neither is he the flip-flopper the Bush campaign deftly portrays him as. I am not so naive as to believe Kerry is perfect. But, like scarletfeather points out, he's no George Bush, which is a damned good thing!
