I remember in the '80s when Bonds was in the beginning of the career that he was one of the best baseball players. But I've never seen anybody in baseball -like Bonds the last two years- that is a constant threat to hit it deep every time he is at bat. His eye-bat coordination has to be off the charts. He can hit any type of pitch deep at any time. The last several years he has ascended from very good status to Babe Ruth status, all while he's been in his mid-late '30s.
