The Tawny Man trilogy is brilliant. I think that the character of the Fool is my favourite of all time. Those people who have read the Farseer Trilogy and the Liveship Traders trilogy absolutely love the series. Basically the story starts with Fitz many years after the Farseer books, living in the forest. The Fool comes to visit after his journey in the Liveship books and the adventure begins again. Though only two books have been written, it is safe to say (in my opinion) that this series is the best so far!!!
