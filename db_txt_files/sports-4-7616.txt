Give Ewing a little credit. This guy is, what, 37 years old? And he just played a decisive role in New York's game 6 comeback against Miami. Ewing hit two big shots and forced a turnover in the final few minutes, proving to me that he's still playing with a lot of heart. Sure, he's never won a title, but the guy has always hit the court with guts, character, and a consistently solid game.
