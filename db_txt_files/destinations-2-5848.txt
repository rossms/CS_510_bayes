We have the highest real estate taxes. We have the highest auto insurance rates. Our lives are maximally controlled by excessive laws and regulations. A multimillionaire bought the governorship and is going to add 14.6 cents to each gallon of gasoline. I live in a bitter, racist little town named Gladstone, we have awful neighbors who call the cops if you walk your dog on their side of the street. Do not come here, the police is so bored and the speed limit is 25mph.
