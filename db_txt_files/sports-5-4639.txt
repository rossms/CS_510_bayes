I agree with Munson. On a personal level, I find Pitino to be slightly annoying. Not sure if it's the smugness or the slickness, but it's something. And at the same time, I have to agree that he's one of the best college coaches in the game. The turn-around he pulled off at Kentucky was really, really impressive. As a Michigan fan, I'm disappointed that he chose Louisville as his next stop. I would have loved to have seen what he could have done in Ann Arbor.
