The strip ran out of ideas long ago. It's deteriorated from being a fairly funny comic strip to what it is now, merely a Garfield industry. Garfield bedspreads - kids' lunch boxes and other merchandise ad nauseum. Cartoonists *should* benefit from their creations, but only if they merit it. Garfield doesn't; it's running on air.
