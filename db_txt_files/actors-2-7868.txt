Chris Rock is a mediocre comedian, but as an actor, he really has not impressed me. None of his characters seem different to me- they all seem like the Chris Rock that I see on stage doing stand-up. That is not what I call acting. His best performance was in Lethal Weapon 4, but he would not have been near as funny had he not been working with Joe Pesci. Should really not even be an actor- he should stick to stand up.
