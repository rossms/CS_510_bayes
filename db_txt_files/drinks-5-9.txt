Some people say that mass produced beers are synonymous with crap. In most cases I am inclined to agress, but Guinness proves that a mass-produced beer can be a tasty and gratifying experience. Thick, frothy and going down easy, this beer is not for everyone. It truly drinks like a meal, and I drink it without food. Another great benefit: it has fewer calories than light beer! It's impossible to go wrong with this one. This is the stout to which other companies must compare themselves.
