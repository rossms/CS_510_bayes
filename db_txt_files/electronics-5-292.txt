We just started using Cybergenie phone system with Voicepulse broadband phone service and it's running smoothly so far. Unlimited voicemail and speech dialing are my favorite features. If you have Microsoft Outlook there is a way to have emails read to you right on the phone! This was a good investment for my office and will be used for many years to come.
