Since I live in Key West, I know how beautiful it is. When you're on the pure white, sandy beach, you can hear the sound of boats passing by the aqua, blue, clear water. The next thing you see is a group of manatees passing through the water. You can see the blinding, colorful, breath-taking sunset go down across the beautiful horizon. You're sitting in paradise.
