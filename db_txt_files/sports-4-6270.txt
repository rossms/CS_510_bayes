I'd like to give Carolina five stars, but I just can't. Not with the Santa Clara loss. I know it was the first game of the year and everything, but there's no excuse to lose to a team with that kind of talent disparity. How do I know what kind of talent Santa Clara has? Because my city league team beat a team with two former Santa Clara players on it last week. No excuse.
