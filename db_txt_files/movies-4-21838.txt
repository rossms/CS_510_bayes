I really liked this flick. Kirk Douglas is the skipper of the USS Nimitz that gets sucked into a time warp and winds up off Oahu on December 6, 1941. The Nimitz flyers make contact with the Japanese Fleet that is approaching Pearl Harbor for the attack. Martin Sheen, Katherine Ross, James Farentino and Ron O'Neal play strong roles. The Nimitz eventually powers up to repel the Japanese assault. Watch the movie to get the end.
