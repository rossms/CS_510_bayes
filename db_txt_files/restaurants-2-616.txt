After several messages after my last review of Krispy Kreme Donuts I decided to give them one more chance. Once again, the donuts did not impress me at all, in fact they weren't nearly as filling as the donuts at Dunkin' Donuts and I also thought they tasted too sweet for the most part. I am still not impressed and highly recommend Dunkin' Donuts over this wannabe donut chain...
