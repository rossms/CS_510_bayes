There were two things I liked with this horror: 1. The labyrint - I've always been extremely facinated of labyrints when I was a child I always dreamt about labyrints in my nightmares! 2. That both the son the mother escaped from the murder survived. In most horror movies all or most of the good people dies! Even in The Blair Witch Project more people died than in this horror, The Shining... Beside of that, I didn't think this movie was very impressing, but then I have to admite that I'm not a huge fan of horror films. I was as a child, but not anymore...
