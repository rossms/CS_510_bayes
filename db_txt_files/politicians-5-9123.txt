President Clinton is one of the best Presidents in our nation's history. he has balanced the budget, led our nation to victory in Kosovo, paved the way for economic recovery, and gave the world peace. He inherited a world left in termoil, Iran was still ready for a war against the U.S., Isreal, Palestine, and Lebanon were at each others throat; and North Korea wouldn't even speak our nation's name. Now, Iran is has started trading with us, We are close to peace in the middle east, and North Korea is begging us to let them back into the world community. The world is a better place because of Mr. Clinton.
