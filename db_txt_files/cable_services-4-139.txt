It's a bunch of bologna! Our dish goes out 3 times a year with rain-fade, and only for a few minutes. Cable is desperate and wants you to care more about how your friggin roof looks than how your tv picture looks. I'd rather have control over my house, dish, and yard, than let those retardos dig around and mess everytihng up. Dish menu rocks, picture rocks, even the selection rocks. Plus, you can install yourself. No crappy truck-roll fees. Do THE DISH!!!!!!
