when a band can make a clip without being actually in the clip it shows the integrity of their music they only want to be recognised for their musical talent not how they look in teir music videos(unlike hhmmmmmm lets see every other band on the planet)well done to TOOL for not being commercial just listen to their music and decide whether or not you like them.
