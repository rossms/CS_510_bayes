Not as bad as I thought it would be. I tried it once when it first came out but couldn't sit through it. Then, I watched it on TV and liked it. I now have it on DVD. Peter Jackson did a nice job on directing the film. I haven't read Tolkien's books, but I plan to someday. It's one of the best fantasy films if you give it a try.
