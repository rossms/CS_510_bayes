I saw this movie awhile back. I found it to be disappointing. Another example of how you can get a talented cast of actors and have the movie do nothing. I found myself caring nothing about any of the characters. I kept waiting for something to happen and nothing really did. Catherine- Zeta Jones was a spoiled tempramental actress, and Julia Roberts was her assistant sister who got treated like dirt. There were other uninteresting characters as well. It was just a boring movie with a waste of some good actors talents.
