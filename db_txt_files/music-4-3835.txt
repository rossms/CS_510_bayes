My favorite is Call me the breeze. I was not really a southern rock fan until I heard Allman bros., but this is a great record. Im just sad that blues based rock has been out of style now since Nirvana infected our youths minds, which in a way to me was the end of real rock n' roll. My band will bring it back! LOL.
