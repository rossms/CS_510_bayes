Ah, the master of shock rock. Alice Cooper is highly underrated in my opinion. He brought theatricsinto rock and has done some excellent albums. This is one of his best efforts and works well around Halloween. I give proprs to this album because it is actually diversified. I also credit Alice because he still puts out great albums and does theatrical tours (he is touring fall 2002 again) which is a rarity in this dayof overpriced tickets and undertalented bands.
