Way too sweet and syrupy. There seems to be a much more overwhelming vanilla flavor, and combined with the fact that Pepsi is sweeter than Coke, it adds to something that isn't very drinkable, especially with a meal. Also, it's odd how in one sip you taste the Pepsi more, then in the next you taste the vanilla more, or vice versa. Vanilla Coke is definetely my preference...it has just the right balance for me.
