You really can't say enough about this guy. He holds most, if not all, NFL all-time wide receiver records and has a work ethic which is unparalleled. While it is always difficult to compare players across eras, it is pretty clear that he is the greatest wide receiver to ever play the game. My only problem with him is that he has had trouble taking a secondary role with the 49ers. I remember before last season Rice said that he was inspired by the way David Robinson took a backseat to Tim Duncan in the Spurs run to the championship. Rice should have come to that conclusion on his own.
