As a lifelong Texas fan, I don't think I can stand to watch Mack pussyfoot around any more. His teams play with virtually no emotion, even against OU. Give me a coach who can make his players want to eat glass over a coach who talks like a politician and seems totally unable to motivate his players to get the best out of them. Winning the award as top recruiting class every year is getting old while watching OU embarrass us year after year. The way he screwed Major Applewhite out of the QB job he deserved his senior year in order to get Chris Simms on the field a year earlier is unforgiveable.
