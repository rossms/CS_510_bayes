I just got back from a weekend trip there. My first time there and I gotta say, I would live there if it weren't for the snow. Manchester and Bennington were gorgeous. Peak season for the leaves changing was one of the most beautiful sights I've ever seen. Everyone was very friendly. There is also a great winery there called North River Winery...excellent wine! Great hiking, skiing for nature lovers...great shopping too. Staying in a B&B or a B&B-like hotel is a must.
