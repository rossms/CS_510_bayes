Christ, there's not much I hate more than movies with a message. I don't care if it's conservative or liberal, if it takes know-it-all, look-at-me, holier-than-thou, tone I tune out. This movie ambushed me with it's agenda right off the bat. Maybe I should've known better, but I never read the book. Hell, I thought I was walking into a seat of my pants thriller chock full of international intrigue. Instead I got a moralistic bore chock full of spy movie cliches. The only good part was the funeral. Mostly because it meant the movie was just about over.
