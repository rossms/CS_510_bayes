Great place to spend two days. Don't spend more than two days here unless you are trying to get laid with such a young population or like to drink in a pub. An experience traverler spends a day and half here. Put it this way, you have one week in Ireland spend it in Cork, Ring of Kerry, and the Cliffs of Mohr. Take the Jameson tour.
