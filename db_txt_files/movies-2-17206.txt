With excellent actors like Harris Ford and Kristin Scott Thomas (?), I expected a lot more from this movie. Ford has decided that raising his upper lip is acting enough, while the plot, although enticing in the come ons, came across as unconvincing. Add to it gratuitous police stuff and I felt I was wasting my time.
