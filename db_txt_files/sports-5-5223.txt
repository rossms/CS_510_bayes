Patrick Ewing ripped up the league while he was at Georgetown with Coach John Thompson in the early to mid '80s. He was the Beast of the East. Ewing was so renowned for his stupendous shot-blocking ability as well as his uncanny ability to hit the long-range J. He had to endure so much discrimination and harrassment. People claimed him and the entire Hoya team illiterate. Therefore, they avoided the media and ended up with that concept becoming known as Hoya Paranoia. Patrick needs to start receiving the credit that is due to him for his years of greatness at Georgetown.
