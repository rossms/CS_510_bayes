Cool country. The French are very direct and in-your-face, if they hate you, they let you know it, unlike... Asians that are all smiley and then give you the finger when you turn around, or Mediterraneans (Spain, Italy, Portugal, Greece) that offer you the world and then try to rip you off. This has been said over and over, just try to speak a little bit of their language, it doesn't have to be perfect, and their attitude with you as a tourist will change.
