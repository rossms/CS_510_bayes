she was around for awhile in the early to mid 90s. I liked her in Corrina Corrina, and the one about the Seal, Andre, she recently showed up in Napoleon Dynamite as the nerdy friend of Napoleon. she had some depth to her acting. as like a lot of kid actors the roles get harder to come by as you get older. I think she is around my daughters age at about 20. she was good in Napoleon Dynamite.
