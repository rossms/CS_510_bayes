Without a doubt the greatest all around quarterback in professional football history. His passing "numbers" were not astronomical like more modern quarterbacks, but he was consistent and a great "team" quarterback. The fact that he played 50 years ago has relegated him to the back burner in most polls- BUT-- Who can match his most important stat- he and his team made it to the pro football championship game each of the ten years he played (before the "Superbowl" existed. His was a career based on excellence and on winning.
