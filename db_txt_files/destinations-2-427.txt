Never been there. Don't want to go. The only communities are little Inuit villages. I don't deny that there is a wealth of culture and art and beauty in these communities, but there is also a wealth of substance abuse and venereal disease. I can see polar bears and seals and beluga whales northern Manitoba anyway.
