One tequila, two tequila, three tequila, floor..as the saying goes. To much of this wonderful drink will make the floor jump up and hit you, but oh, what a wonderful drink you can have if you have Cuervo Gold as one of the ingredients. Margarita s are wonderful made with this as the base. It s a great tequila!
