In its hey-day in the 1970s, this one was up there with some of my other favorites like Broom Hilda, while Cathy could not get a laugh out of me if I was stoned on a Thai Stick. Fast forward 30 years later. Broom Hilda is gone (I think), Hagar is still around (though it lost some of its edge), and Cathy still can't get a laugh out of me even if I was stoned on a Thai Stick.
