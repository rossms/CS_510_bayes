I am a native of Detroit, though I have moved since, and I always love to visit. Detroit gets a lot of bad press as being dangerous, especially downtown, but there has been a lot of rejuvenation in the last 10 years, and its beginning to come back to its former glory. One of the most important cities for history of invention in our country to be sure. If you're going to visit be sure to stop at Greenfield Village/Henry Ford Museum and hit Greektown as a night spot. Also, downtown is the best Mexican restaurant anywhere in the U.S., bar none, Xochimilco. Great place to hit after the Grand Prix.
