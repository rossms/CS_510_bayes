As an Iowa Hawkeye fan I fully support Lloyd Carr. Even though Michigan is able to recruit superior talent, Iowa will always have a chance with Carr at the helm. Carr's biggest obstacle may be the inablity to coach consistent offensive line run blocking. The inablity to consistently run the ball has made Michigan just a good rather than great offensive team. Don't get me wrong-- they still have the players who can make the big play, but teams from Iowa, Wisconsin and Minnesota don't fear the Wolverines, and in fact look forward to playing a game that is very winnable. Long Live Lloyd Carr!!!!!
