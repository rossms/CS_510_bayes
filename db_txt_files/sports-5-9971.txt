Tremendous Team and the best one in the league - period. It is universally known that Portland is, by far, the deepest team in the league. The problem is that, traditionally, deep teams don't win championships. The last deep team to win was Detroit in 1990, but they were led by Mastermind/Coach Chuck Daly. Portland's coach is Mike Dunleavy, decent but unproven, and Portland's chances of winning it all will depend on Dunleavy's ability and strategy come playoff time.
