This one's pretty dang funny. I've seen it many times and it still makes me laugh. Some parts of it are hilariously funny. But at the same time when looking at the story as a whole it's a stinker. It's like scenes of sketch comedy all coming together to make the entire movie. Mel Brooks and Dave Shapell (sp?) are excellent.
