It's refreshing to eat something that's fresh and relatively healthy; It's good eating, with a variety of choices and your choice of a six inch or twelve inch size. The bread is pretty good; the downfall is that it is EXTREMELY busy at lunchtime (at the ones I frequent), and since it's made fresh, you're going to have to wait. It's worth the wait, though.
