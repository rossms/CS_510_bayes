If I had to pick my favorite fast food burger restaurant,it would be Burger King. I prefer flame broiled to fried. I think the burgers taste better this way.If my children have a choice of burger restaurants they also pick Burger King. our son likes the chicken tenders.{ pretty good} I like the whopper always have.Fast food burgers are not quite as good as a burger I could get at certain restaurants. As for fast food Burger King is good.
