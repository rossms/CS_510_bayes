Now this is a video. Peter Garbriel was so brilliant in 1986 with this video that it became the #1 music video of 1986. I loved how his mind worked while he made this video. Who would have thought to make a face from fruits, from a house, from other things and then seeing the elements of science take place in the video as well. It was overall very creative....Great JOB!
