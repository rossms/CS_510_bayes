I am a HUGE Rage fan and I think this is their second best album next to self-titled, it is SOOOOOO much better than evil empire and renegades and i can't believe people can even think of comparing it to Blibk182 and Limp Bizkit... How dare you!!! The music is so powerful both musically and politically and one of their best
