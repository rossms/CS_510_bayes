It's not hard for people to think that Mr. Bush is a good president because the bar has been set so low for him. Most people expect more out the phone company than Mr. Bush. Although I do pitty him because he has been under a microscope since he was elected just waiting for him to screw up a sentance. At least he has had former President Clinton drawing most of the attention away from him. I have heard more about where slick willy's office is going to be than how George W is catering to big business for their small controbutions (yeah right) during his campaign.
