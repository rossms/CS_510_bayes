Don't fall off you chair as you read this; I'm actually sticking up for a liberal! Lieberman seems to be one of the most candid, honest, and sensible guys on the political scene today (at least, that's the way he strikes me). I guess that's why he got hosed as a Democratic candidate. He's fairly self-effacing, has a good sense of humor, and really does come across well in his concern for making things better in this country. OK, that's about as far as I can go embracing the Left today!
