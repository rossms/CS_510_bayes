All criticism (and scientific studies) bemoaning fast food aside, McDonald's is good. Its menu offers a wide selection of food, and it is doing a better job of offering more healty options (i.e. low-fat dressing, apple caramel dippers, and parfaits). The drive through time (at least at the franchise I frequent) is decent; I can usually drive in and drive out in two minutes. The restaurant is always clean, and the employees are somewhat inviting. Lastly, if and when I don't think my food is satisfactory, I can bring up my concerns to the manager, who immediately honors my problems without question.
