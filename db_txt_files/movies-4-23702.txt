I enjoyed that movie and thought it was much better than Star Trek 9. I was surprised it did not do better. I did not like that they brought back a new data just to keep the door for Brent Spiner open to come back for a new movie. Data died and they should have left it that way. I will miss Star Trek TNG movies but I understand why this was the last movie. It was a good movie and in my eyes underrated.
