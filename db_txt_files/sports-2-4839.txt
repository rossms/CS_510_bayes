Herb actually won a close one last night, but it was luck and not coaching brilliance. Some of the other posts refer to blown leads and one said he's clueless once the ball goes up. That about sums it up. How many times have we seen them not take the high percentage shot because the shot clock hasn't run down enough? The Princeton offense is boring and we look like we're trying not to lost instead of trying to win. Sorry, Herb. Let's get an exciting coach!
