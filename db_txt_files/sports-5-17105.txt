One of the best defensive teams in NFL history and an offense that tore people up in the playoffs. Gruden finally lived up to his name as an offensive genius, and hopefully the trend will continue. They don't pick until 64th, so they had better do a good job of drafting. With people like Gruden at the helm, I see the possibility for the first mini dynasty in a long while.
