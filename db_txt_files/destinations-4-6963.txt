The great sites everyone lists below are a given, but I really enjoy just walking around (roaming?) in Rome. Strolling at night gives the city an entirely different look and it is the best time to people-watch. Taxis are surprisingly cheap there, and on a hot day the speed and air conditioning make it an even better value. I give it 4 stars instead of 5 because Rome's a bit chaotic for my tastes and the public transportation is not as easy or thorough as London's or Paris'.
