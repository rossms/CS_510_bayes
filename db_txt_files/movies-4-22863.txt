While I enjoyed the first X-Men movie, this was much improved. This one provided more action, more thrills, more character development and all in all, more enjoyment. For the most part, the actors played the roles perfectly especially Hugh Jackman as Wolverine. The only one that still annoyed me a little was Anna Paquin as Rogue; that casting still doesn't make any sense to me. For a fun piece of fantasy/sci-fi/action, this is great!
