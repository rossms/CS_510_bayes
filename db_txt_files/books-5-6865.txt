I found these books to be hysterical. Lister makes a great (and believable) main character. The robot kind of reminded me of Marvin the Paranoid Android, and I loved it. The ego-maniacal cat (and the pretext of the religious war between the cat sects) was great as well. In fact....I don't think there's anything I didn't like about these books. If it was for Grant and Naylor's names being on the cover, you'd swear you were reading an Adams book. I highly recommend these books.
