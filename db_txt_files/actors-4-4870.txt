I have to admit something first-off...I've only seen one of Christian Bale's movies (Swing Kids). Judging by the other comments posted, I need to expand that list a bit. And I will. In the one movie I did see, though, he added a lot to the story and developed his character very well, which is why I decided to look for him on this site. :)
