Bland- thats all I can say- was held over in Omaha awhile back. Bleak and flat, lots of empty buildings-or so it seemed. Too conservative and not aware of much except the corn huskers playing football- like the blind leading the blind here- My advice to the people of this state- wake up before its too late.
