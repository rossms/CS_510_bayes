The movie was a bit disapointing, but all-in-all, I got some hearty laughs out of it. It was very sophmoric in terms of crude language. The movie also lagged through large parts. But when it hit, it was pee your pants funny. The closing scene was great. If you get 3 or more healthy laughs from a comedy movie, you got your money's worth. Steve Carell is on a roll. He is a comic talent. I am impressed that "Daily Show" alums Carell (The Office) and the very hilarious Steven Colbert (The Colbert Report) are getting air time.
