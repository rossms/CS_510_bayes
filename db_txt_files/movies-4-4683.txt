Although touted is a comedy, Lilo Stitch, while amusing at times (Cobra Bubbles, anyone?) with slapstick and references, is mainly a drama, in the classic Disney fashion. The animation, which many reviewers panned, is great in my opinion. While the cast has no big names, the acting is spot-on. Recommended.
