In the 20s is the perfect spot for W M. It's a great place to go to school, but right now it's not top 20. Pros: Fantastic education professors teach virtually every class. Also, the price is right if you're a resident of Virginia. Drawbacks include the fact that it's not located in an urban setting, so there's less to do. Also, grading there is pretty tough.
