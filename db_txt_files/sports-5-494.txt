The greatest hitting catcher of all-time. Excellent hitter with tremendous power and great ability to hit for average. Like Vlad Guerrero, he hits balls out of the strike zone over the fence. His defense is underrated and he calls a good game behind the plate. Unfortunately, injuries have slowed down an amazing career. I hope that he goes to the American League and DH's on a team that can get him a ring.
