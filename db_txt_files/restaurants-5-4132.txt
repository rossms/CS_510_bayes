Been to the one in my town, Wilmington, NC, many many times. Great food and atmosphere! There is normally a wait to get in, but I have never waited more than 15 or 20 minutes, no matter what day or time it is. Everyone who I have met who works there is extremely friendly, especially the bartender Jack, hes the best!
