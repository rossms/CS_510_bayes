I find it funny that the people who hate these vehicles probably know absolutely nothing about them at all! The Cadillac Escalade offers two engines- both V8. One produces 285hp and the other produces 345hp. The 345hp engine is only available with AWD. Seating for 7 or 8, depending on seating arrangements. The argument that its nothing more than a Tahoe is no longer correct, as it has been completley over hauled for 2002. If people want to put 26 inch rims on them, fine. Cadillac is selling them like crazy and is a success. Huge SUV's are the greatest thing since the microwave.
