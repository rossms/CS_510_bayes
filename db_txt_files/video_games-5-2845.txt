I spent probably somewhere in the ballpark of $50 at the arcade playing this game over and over again, beads of sweat dripping down my face, an intense drive pushing my hands to glide all over the arcade pad, people looking at me funny. I just couldn t get enough and luckily stopped my MvC2 arcade addiction when I purchased it for the Dreamcast. It was the greatest $40 investment I had ever made. I could now enjoy this surreal fighting experience in the safety of my own home.
