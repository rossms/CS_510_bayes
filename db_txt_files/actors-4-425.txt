Since I'm 30 right now, my primary memory of Alec Guinness is from his role as Obi Wan Kenobi in Star Wars. He was perfect for that part, and he brought a sense of acting legitimacy that was one of the key factors (along with the breakthrough technology and a great script that tied into universal themes) that raised Star Wars from the ranks of typical B-movies into its current position as one of the most-watched, most-loved movies of all time. Like all one-time Star Wars fanatics, I felt a sense of loss when I heard that Guinness died the other day.
