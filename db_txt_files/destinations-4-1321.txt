Not the warmest people on the planet and the food's a bit limited , although generally tasty. Beer is generally good if a bit lacking in variety. Many of the towns are beautiful and the scenery often stunning. Interesting historically and culturally - schlosses, Beethoven.. Higher proportion of stunning babes than most places I've visited. Homeland to many of rock's more interesting groups e.g. Kraftwerk, Neu, Fuast, Can, Tamgerine Dream. In general, stupidly written off by narrow minded Brits and Yanks who still bleat on about WW2, even though 99% never lived through it.
