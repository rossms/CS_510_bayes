Newberry is a wonderful place to go to school. Granted that some of the facilities arein need of attention, that does not diminish the quality of people that are here and education that one gets. Newberry is a place where everyone can feel like they are a part of something, from athletics to organizations there is something for everyone. I don't know of a better environment to learn in than one where the professors know their students and want to help them succeed, and that's just what you get at Newberry.
