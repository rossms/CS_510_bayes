Eldos are not bad but are not great either. I guess you'd want to drive a Cadillac if you were over 65 and wanted to announce it to the world by driving one of these behemoths. In the image department, Cadillacs leave much to be desired. When was the last time anyone said owning a Cadillac was cool? 1964? If you want luxury with style, quality, power and prestige buy an Acura or a Lexus. Unless you don't mind being called gramps by your co-workers.
