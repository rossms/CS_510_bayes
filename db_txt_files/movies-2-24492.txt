Some humorous moments, but the film overall does not come off quite as well as the first film does. Smith and Jones do not compliment each other as well as they did in the first film, which significantly reduces the overall quality of the film. The comedic and sci-fi elements were also not as solid as the first. Overall, MIB II hardly competes with the first film and probably did more harm than good for the overall MIB franchise.
