Yikes. First half of the book was very promising. . .second half was tedious, slow-moving, and not very interesting. I don't mind the heavy-handed religious message of the book, I just think it could have been written with a little more skill. My general feeling was that I wanted the book to be better than it was. I must have the problem because I seem to be the only person who didn't love this book. (My small community has thus given me the solemn head shake when I tell them what I think of their new favorite book. . .)
