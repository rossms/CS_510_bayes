I gave this truck a two star rating because it is American made ,Othrewise its a one. Dont buy this with the idea great trucks are built, not bought. What you test drive is all youre going to get. This is not a expandable platform at all I dont care how much Flowmaster , B&M or after market reprograming you do you'll not do as well as a stock chevy or Dodge V-8 for the same money, However for a cheap little delivery vehicle at a cheap price go for it, as for my daily driver its sad, slow and a real eago booster for the little old lady who leaves me behind at the red light. 3.0 5 sprrd standard
