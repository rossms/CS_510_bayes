Its good for light users, some people would be quite satisfied to have around 100 songs (3-4Mb per song) on an average. I think its a pretty good idea. well speaking about the price, yes it could be slightly overpriced focusing on the specs but at least you get a stable platform and a massive vraiaties of accesories for it.
