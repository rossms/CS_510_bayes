Mmmmm Mmmmmm..can't beat that taste of mint in pure chocolate! Junior Mints are my favorite candy (along with Goobers) to get at the movies. And, if you ever go to the movies with me, I will offer you some when I first open them, but if you do not accept, don't expect a second chance, they are mine ALL MINE! And, who can forget the Seinfeld episode where Kramer was enjoying this chocolatey/minty delight while watching the Operation!
