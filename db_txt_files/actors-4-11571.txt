When I saw her in the movie for the first time, I could't even breathe. She was so cute. I really loved this actress. But there was something boring. She has never changed. Of course, she has tried to change her images, performance abilities. But she failed. She managed to perform certain roles in 'Courage under Fire', etc...Now she is 40. She needs some thrilling impulse.
