My in-laws rented an a-l-a-m-o twice...first: from Nash- ville to Los Angeles, and back...second: from Nashville to Florida Keys, and back. B-O-T-H were very good-to-great experiences. S-o, we rentedan a-l-a-m-o, also, from Nashville to mid-South Carolina. This was a great experience...new car (with only 800 miles on it)...great service people at Nashville airport location...g-r-e-a-t rate for four days...super gas mileage with a 6-cylinder. We will rent an a-l-a-m-o, again...and, recommend this to family and friends. A MOST WONDERFUL EXPERIENCE !!!!!
