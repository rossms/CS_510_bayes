The Kings may not be one of the top teams in the West, but they're definitely one of the most fun to watch. Webber is an all-NBA talent, Vlade is underrated, and Jason Williams has the potential to develop into a great guard (assuming he can cut down on the unnecessarily flashy passes and stop taking idiotic 3-pointers from 10 feet behind the line). The talent is there - they just need to put it together. Remember, the Kings were one game away from eliminating the eventual NBA champion Lakers in this year's playoffs. They'll definitely be an exciting team to watch next year.
