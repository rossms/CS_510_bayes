One of the things people love about Boston is the diverse ethnicity. One of the things they hate is the racism. Got news for ya: They are two branches of the same tree. Can't have an ethnic neighborhood without being racist or segregationist. I lived in an ethnic neighborhood for ten years in Boston, and was never treated as an insider. My husband looked the part, and he was accepted from Day One.
