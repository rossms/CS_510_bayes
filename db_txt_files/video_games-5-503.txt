This is my favorite board game. Everytime I went to visit my grandparents my grandfather and I would spend hours playing Monopoly. Brings back great memories. It's educational, you learn great math skills. I have the Monopoly game my granfather had from the 1930's, wooden game pieces. I like it better than the new one I bought four years ago.
