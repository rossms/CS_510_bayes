Tecate is definitely growing on me as a nice alternative to Corona. It is a very light beer, and like Corona, tastes good with a lime. It is also pretty easy to put back a bunch of these in a row. Next time you are in a bar, look for the distinctive red can. And if you are concerned about drinking beer out of a can - don't be. This beer pulls it off somehow, and as an added bonus, is pretty damn cheap.
