Heres something i dont get. How can everybody say he does nothing for a team and sux ballz, and say he only cares about himself and cant get his team to win. lets look at the stats. As of oday 12/17/05 the Rockets are 0-8 without T-mac, but are freakin 9-4 with him. How is he not helping? Explain to me that. T-Mac is amazing, end of discussion. 13 IN 30 IS IMPOSSIBLE.
