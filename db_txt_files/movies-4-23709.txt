I had mixed feelings about this one. I enjoyed the story, and the acting was solid, especially by Tom Hardy who played the villain Shinzon. He was evil and mean without being sleazy, which is something not too many people in the movies seem to be able to pull off these days. I thought the part where they ran around in the dune buggy was out of place, though, and don't get me started about the ending. I hate it when they kill off major characters, especially ones that have been around since the very beginning.
