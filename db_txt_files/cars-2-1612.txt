I was very excited to get my first car in september, with only 64,000miles on it. I got a sentra...thinking this would last at least a couple years. Now, after no problems, i take it for inspection only to find out that it will cost me over $1000!! Being a college student, who has that kind of money!?!?! 1st it needs new brakes, then new rotors, then 2 new tires, then timing belts, then resurfaced back brakes, then a new alternator....then my speakers are blown....it never ends!!!!! Be careful before you buy this car!
