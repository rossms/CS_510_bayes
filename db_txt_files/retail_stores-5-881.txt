LB has improved greatly over the years. When I was first introduced to LB, they only had old women clothes. Now, they stay abreast of the latest trends fashions, so I can show off my curves in style. My only complaint? WAY too much sheer! I have 2 sheer shirts, that's plenty. But they seem to be stuck in a rut there. A girl can only where so much sheer!
