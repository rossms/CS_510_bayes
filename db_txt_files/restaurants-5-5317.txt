This place can be downright addictive! Try the Five-Star Filet...gorgeous, tender meat - filet mignon wrapped in bacon. Last week I went there after my modeling shoot, with a couple of fellow models...and we tried lots of stuff. I enjoyed the grilled pork chops...two tender, juicy 8-oz. center-cut chops, mesquite-grilled to perfection. YUM!!!
