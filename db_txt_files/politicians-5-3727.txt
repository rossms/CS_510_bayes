Esskay's review of George W. Bush was neither helpful nor intelligent. Why should Bush (or anyone) feel remorse for someone getting the death penalty? Look at the crimes these creeps have committed. Talk to the families of the victims and see how they feel. You bleeding heart liberals would change your tune if your child was beaten, raped murdered by some slime ball thug.
