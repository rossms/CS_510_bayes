King Kong was AMAZING! it was the best movie I had ever seen. It could have been a little better, but man was it good. They had such good special effacts. When you saw the bugs and dinos you couldn't tell if they were real or special fx. Unfortunatly it isn't that funny.(why would Jack Black be in it if it wasn't) anyway Jack Black was exellent for the role.
