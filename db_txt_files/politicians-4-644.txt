Severly underrated. He put a human face on the Soviet Empire, and showed that decent, intelligent people do come from Russia. And let's face facts, all you Reagan-worshipers. If Misha hadn't been on the other side of the table willing to negotiate, none of the cold war 'victories' achieved by Reagan would have happened. He didn't do it alone, and I hope that history treats him better than his own people have.
