Although there're lots of new computer graphics in this imax, it's still not as good as the original Fantasia. I was quite disappointed at the fact that they used the Mickey Mouse section straight from the old Fantasia w/o editing it. At least I couldn't see the difference. It's alright to rent I guess, but as an imax I don't think it's worth paying big bucks for.
