Not the best film ever, but i found it strangley moving. I wish i could go to K- Pax. I wish I could see things throught the eyes of Kevin Spacey's character. What a brilliant actor. What a different film. I love the fact that it is left up to us to figure if Prod(?) is from another world or not. I like to think he was. Beautifully shot a lovingly acted. K-Pax is a different type of film, that has effected me in a way i cannot describe.
