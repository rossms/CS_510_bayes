I personally think that this pathetic store super sucks and that only poser kids shop there to only be more punk , more goth or more raver ...People say that buying at this store makes you different when really your not cause they sell the same shirt to everyone else...they don't discontinue something just cause you bought something. I'm sure the non-posers in the world, even preps know that true rockers make their own clothing.
