Great music video! Captured the feeling of desperation in modern urban America. From the beginning shot over Broad St (the longest stretch of staright road in any big city in the world) it transmits a feeling of being lost, forgotten amidst the turmoil and chaos of existence. But is also hopeful that redemption can be found in the companionship of others, The night has fallen, I'm lyin' awake I can feel myself fading away So receive me brother with your faithless kiss or will we leave each other alone like this On the streets of Philadelphia. One of the best songs/ videos.
