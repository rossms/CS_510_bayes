Banana Republic was once one of the most original stores around. Quasi-safari/outdoor clothes that no one else had yet didn't make the wearer look like an Indiana Jones wannabe. The original store in SF was pretty wild. Then the founding couple sold it and now its become some generic teeny bopper store. BR, A F, J. Crew, what's the difference. Thankfully Travelsmith picked up a little from the old BR.
