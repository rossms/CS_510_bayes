Just returned from 3 days (business trip). Friendly, loving, caring... very nice people live in Cartagena (near the beach and old town areas). They work hard and play hard. The city does not sleep. A taxi ride at 1am has us seeing people hanging around, sitting at the front of their houses, in bars, at soda stands. It is busy. Safety - I felt safe. I stayed in areas considered more safe, went about my own business and just plain stayed out of trouble. Old town is special and worth a look. Some shops are for tourists. The night life is vibrant.
