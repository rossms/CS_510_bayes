Nothing beats copenhagen, when i chew i want to taste tabacco, not cherries, the only flavore i want in my chew is tabacco and and whiskey, i dont remember who said it but i agree cope should go to all plastic cans, but makes no difference on freshness to me, because a can goes in about 6 hours, and donovan, maybe you're right, its kind of a nasty habbit, but i enjoy it.
