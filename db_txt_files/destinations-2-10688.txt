I'm sorry to all you Kool fans out there, and I know I'm gonna get a low rating for ragging on this cig, but I just don't like it. I am a menthol smoker, and I have high standards for my ciggarettes, especially taste, and kools are some of my least favorite menthol cigarrettes. The blend is not quite right and it comes off tasting cheap. Try Marlboro Menthols/Menthol Lights instead.
