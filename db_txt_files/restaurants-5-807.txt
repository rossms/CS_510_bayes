i love subway too, the only thing i don't like about it...the bread is made of wheat. some people are illergic to wheat ( i try not to eat it a lot), maybe they should have one type of roll that is a subsitute made of rye or spelt flour or something. but other than that, i still love it. plus, if you are trying to lose weight, good, but still, there are carbs in the wheat, just don't eat it every day.
