This is more powerful than PS2 and Nintendo Gamecube, so it will have better graphics and faster loading times. This is Microsoft's first time developing a gaming system, so they do not have as many developers as the PS2. However, they have made Halo a hit, and that should help keep their fan base for the Xbox 360. The only negative with the Xbox is that popular game franchises such as Resident Evil, Metal Gear Solid, and Final Fantasy do not appear for the Xbox. I hear that a Final Fantasy game will be made for the Xbox 360 however, so this is good news.
