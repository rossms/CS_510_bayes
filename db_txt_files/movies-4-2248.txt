I gave the movie Top Gun a good rating. I enjoyed the constant action of the movie, the dogfights, etc. I also enjoyed it because there wasn't only one plot, there were sub-plots that didn't revolve around the main subject of the movie. But, I did notice some inaccuracies in the movie, about flying formation and technology that bothered me a little. This did not take away from the movie as a whole.
