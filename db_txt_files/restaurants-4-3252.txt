As a pizza chain, Papa John's is three stars, but when one looks at those who deliver, the rating improves to four. One can't really expect a gourmet pizza to be prepared and delivered quickly. What separates Papa John's from Dominos is the taste and the garlic sauce that adds an extra zing to the flavor. The only downside is that one needs a coupon to get the price where it needs to be (though most will just give you one if needed) and there is no deep-dish option.
