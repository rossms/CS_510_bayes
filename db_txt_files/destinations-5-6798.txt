This is a great place to live! The taxes are a little high, but cost of living is low. I'm a fan of the bigger cities like Lincoln and Omaha, but the farm is fun with four-wheelers and parties. All the University of Nebraska teams are really good, so we don't need an expensive professional team. Anyone who judges Nebraska by the interstate is shallow and uneducated.
