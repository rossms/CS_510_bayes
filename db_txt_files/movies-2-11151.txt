This movie was terrible! I loved the first two Austin Powers, but this was just junk! This movie was disgusting, and boring. The guy that ate his skin wasn't funny, and there was no romance between Austin and Foxy Cleopatra. These movies are based on James Bond, and yet there was no sexy, romantic kind of scenes, which kind of kills the point of it. The only reason I don't rate it terrible is that I saw twice and the first time I liked it, but I can't remember why. There must have been something funny there though.
