God alimighty, I love this place! The steakburgers are the best and I love the stringy fries. The burgers have a unique flavor and aren't overly greasy like McDonald's or BK. And the shakes are wonderful, nice and thick. I miss Steak N' Shake so much because we don't have them in Nebraska or Iowa. The closest ones are in St. Louis- every time I go back for a visit, I have to go to Steak and Shake!!
