Average describes this girl. She is not good-looking in the least and is not a good actress. Give me a Monica Belucci or Halle Berry (although Berry seems like she could be a high maintenance biotch... anyone who saw Monster's Ball knows what I'm talking about uh huh huh huh) anyday over this plain broad.
