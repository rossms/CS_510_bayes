The Yankees have spent more money over the last few years than any team in history aquiring new talent. Joe Torre has been gifted with unbelievable players over the last five years or so, and so cannot be held solely responsible for the NYY's titles. Seriously, Ronald McDonald could have won the same number of titles with this lineup. Joe Torre merely hit the major league jackpot. Man, I could even win a world series with these guys. Enough with the Joe Torre ass-kissery already.
