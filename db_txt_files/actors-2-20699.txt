The first time I saw Ellen was several years ago when she had a commercial for her tv show. She was jumping up and down on a bed, yelling My name is Ellen I'm on after Roseanne! My name is Ellen I'm on after Roseanne! She could be the funniest, smartest person in the world for all I know, but once I saw that commercial I remember thinking that there is no way I will ever watch this colossal moron.
