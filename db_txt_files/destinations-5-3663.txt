I live a couple hours drive from Kansas City, it is a great place to spend a weekend. It is sort of the junction where the South meets the Midwest, very friendly people. Excellent restaurants, clubs, shopping etc. Downtown is dead though. Some awesome neighborhoods, and some very scary ones. The terrain is 'not flat as people often believe, it is very hilly with lots of trees and parks. Only criticism is Worlds of Fun, I've been going there since I was a little kid, I think it needs a makeover, just seems it's starting to look kind of old.
