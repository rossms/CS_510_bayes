i grew up in new jersey. yes, it's very crowded and polluted, but not so much as everyone thinks. yes, some of the people are asshats, but there's no truth in saying it's not the same anywhere else. there is a lot of cool stuff in jersey, a lot of interesting history. while i wouldn't really want to spend a night in newark or trenton, the small towns of jersey really are great. nobody realizes what kind of cool things came from there! like drive-in movies, the first us brewery, campbell's soup, allen ginsberg, frank sinatra, and even bon jovi! gotta love it...
