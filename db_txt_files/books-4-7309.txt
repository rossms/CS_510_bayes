This book was a good choice, it had excellent recommendations. Plenty of hostel phone #s. Poor maps though. Needed more background info. on cities. Train info. sucked too. Good reviews of bars/sites of interest/restaurants. Complaint: all hostels are usually booked due to the popularity of this book and the Lonely Planet Western Europe book.
