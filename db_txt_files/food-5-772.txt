Fruit Loops offer a sugary, radioactive, and sometime painful start to the day. Shaped suspicously like razor wire, these "loops" can slice the roof of your mouth open in a hurry - but before you start thinking this is a bad thing, understand that abrasions in your mouth can speed the delivery of sugar into your blood stream. And Fruit Loops bring the sugar. And the unworldly colors. I rarely partake any more, but I'll still happily down half a box in a sitting if given the opportunity.
