This is a very entertaining and uplifting movie. Ernest Borgnine as Marty can seem oblivious to his brutal honesty sometimes ( Yeah, we're a couple of dogs all right ). But you can't hold it against him because he's such a tender-hearted, good-natured guy. A great performance on his part. The story deals with what kind of priorities to look for in a romantic relationship. I think it also stands the test of time well because the nostalgia factor adds a special charm to it.
