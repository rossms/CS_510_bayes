I never wanted an SUV until I drove a JEEP. I love my new 2002 Grand Cherokee Laredo. It is probably THE toughest SUV around, AND it can be considered a luxury vehicle. For tough, I got a V8 engine, 4wd, skid plates, upgraded suspension, and tow hooks. For luxury, I got heated leather seats, sunroof, and auto-everything. How can anyone consider anything else? Unless its a Grand Cherokee Overland I suppose.... $$ bling bling $$
