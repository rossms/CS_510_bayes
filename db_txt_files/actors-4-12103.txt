Fiesty, solid actress who has appeared in a number of artsy flicks, the best known being The Piano(for which she won her Oscar). She has demonstrated an pretty good range of characters, playing, among udder things, a cop, a psychologist, a femme fatal, and a sexual deviate. You can always expect a professional performance from Ms. Hunter, although her Appalacian accent does take some getting used to. She's hitting the age where she may start getting pushed into smaller, less inteteresting roles, but not quietly, one would suspect.
