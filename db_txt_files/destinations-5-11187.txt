this place is great! It is wonderful for families or for an adventurous getaway for couples or for a group. There are soo many waterslides and lounge chairs for whenever you need a break. Cool off with delicious ice cream treats or satisfy your appetite with their tasty sandwiches. I greatly suggest this as one of the top waterpark attractions. Allez Viens!!
