In my opinion, Doug Flutie is the epitome of sportsmanship and teammanship. Even though he had been given a raw deal, he put it behind him and thought of the team and winning, not himself. Every chance he got to play, the team rallied around him and protected him. With Doug on the field, the team seemed to get his winning spirit. I have had the pleasure of watching Doug play at Ralph Wilson Stadium, and when he is on the field, he is not only a natural leader and winner, he is a great sportsman as well.
