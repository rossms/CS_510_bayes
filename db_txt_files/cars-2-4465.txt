We actually love this van for many reason - drives great, comfort, appearance. But we HATE Ford Motor Co. for screwing its customers. We too are victims of the faulty head gasket at 74K. Replaced the entire engine. Ford did offer assistance and we only paid $1,450.00. It should have been $4,200.00. Most didn't get squat. Secret Warranties are a great way to handle a problem!
