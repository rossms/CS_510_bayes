One of the greatest Japanese actors of alltime. Born In China of Japanese parents. Did not get to Japan til he was 21. Made many memorable pictures(Japanese) some of which I was never able to see. 2 films I still remember were Hell In The Pacific(American) and The Seventh Samurai. If he had more English speaking roles and more American exposure. I'd give him a 4.7.
