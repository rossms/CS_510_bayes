At his best, one of the greatest directors who ever lived. At his very worst, he still wasn't bad. The prime of his work (Citizen Kane, Touch of Evil, MacBeth, Lady From Shanghai, the Magnificent Ambersons) stands as one of the great achievements in film-making. From the size of him it looks like he was a pretty good man at the craft-services table too.
