I also have a love for Limon chips!!! I'm in Chapin, SC (near Columbia) and can't find them anywhere in the state. Or the region. I recently went to the Dominican Republic and had Limoncitas, which were not as good as the Limons. But pleeeeeease sell Limon in SC for me and everyone else who would appreciate them. For now, I'm trying to get by on the hint of lime tostidos. not as good... but better than nothing.
