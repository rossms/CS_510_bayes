There's a lot to like about Big Easy - the French Quarter, the fun loving atmosphere and uninhibited attitudes of the people, the charm o the garden district but one unforgivable fault: The place is DANGEROUS. Lots of seedy types roaming the tourist areas waiting to rob or murder or maim the unsuspecting tourist. BEWARE!
