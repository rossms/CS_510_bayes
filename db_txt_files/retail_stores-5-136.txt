Cannot say enough good things about this site. So many things I want, so little money! You can check out your account and review what you've ordered in the past. They take personal checks. They notify you when your item has been shipped. They have good e-mail customer service. And there is so MUCH to choose from. You can order out-of-print books and they'll try to get them for you. A gift certificate for Amazon would be a great gift for almost anyone.
