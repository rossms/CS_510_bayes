All of this talk of Bush being dumb is really a matter of opinion, albeit a poor one. Bush is a Harvard graduate, while Gore did not graduate from Vanderbilt and he receieved 5 F's out of 8 classes at the divinity school. Bush is a proven uniter in Texas among Reps. Dems. Gore his accomplices have shown to be dividers. THANK GOD that Bush is the next Prez.
