Coach Thuggins or Thuggy Bear is what is worng about College Basketball. He exploits players as athletes and doesnt give a crap about their academics. Thuggins recruits bad kids and will do what he can to keep them eligible and bail them out of jail. He doesnt apologize for it either. Thug , criminal players and he hasnt even won a National Title and only once been to a Final Four, yet has had talent - Van Excel, Kenyon Martin, Danny Fortson, Reuben Patterson. Still the kids are bad and so is he.
