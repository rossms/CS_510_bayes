Parliament Lights are by far the best cigarettes out there. When I first started smoking, my choice cigarette was always Marlboro Lights. When my friend started smoking Parliament Lights, I bummed one and was sold. The taste is so smooth and refreshing. I also like the way the recessed filter feels around my lips. P-Lights have never made me feel sick and there is no thick smoke that lingers. However, I don't understand why Parliament Lights are only popular here in the Philly area. Whether you are a smoker or not, I suggest going out and buying a pack.
