Fitzgerald is a great author! The way he constructs sentences and descriptions is amazing and so innovative. It is amazing the way he put this story together-all the symbolism is almost to much to digest in one reading. But, it is totally worth it. Other good books of his is Tender is the Night and The Beautiful and The Damned.
