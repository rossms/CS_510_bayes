His post presense (thats one word I have trouble spelling) is phenominal! He's putting up double doubles, week after week like nobody's business. Personally, I think that whole starting junior squad should have their jersies retired... I find it so funny that all these newscasters on national TV call him by his dad's name; Scott. It just goes to show you, like father, like son. MAD PROPS TO SEAN FOR BEING NAMED THE ACC PLAYER OF THE YEAR!!!!!!!!!
