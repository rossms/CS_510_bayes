This university is sometimes called the Ivy of the South. It is not only a terrific school, but the price is 1/3 less than the Ivies. It was rated #1 for value by Kiplingers and in the top 15 by U.S. News, and has the third highest endowment per student, so I'm surprised there isn't a higher rating here.
