I read this book in my english class and I really Liked it. The point wus so realistic. Many people did not understand why geroge did kill lenny. I thought it wus the right thing to do because he actually let lenny die happy and got to him before the others could. He saved lenny from all the tourture he would of went through if curly would have found him. I also saw the movie. I liked the book better though it wus more discriptive.
