Unbelieveably beautiful! It's just one of those places where you find yourself staring at everything. The detail on the buildings is just incredible. You walk around thinking how amazing it must have been to grown up around such architecture. Of course then you realize that for most of the last 60 years they've been as poor as dirt and that it probably wouldn't be worth the trade off. I would recommend Prague to anyone, it is truly astounding.
