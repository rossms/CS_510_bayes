I ordered a bottle of Goldenbarr Chocolate Vodka off their web-site a couple of weeks ago and I was delighted. The bottle arrived along with a recipe booklet containing great mixed drink ideas, and I enjoyed them all, especially the chocolate Coke . For all you true vodka lovers, you'll love it straight, right out of a chilled bottle!
