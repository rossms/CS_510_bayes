It seems like every minute that Earl Boykins spends on the court, his team outscores it's opponents. When they take him out, it's like letting the air out of a balloon. At 5'7" (If he indeed, is that tall) Boykins can still control the action against players who tower over him. He is quick, tough, and a deadly accurate shooter. The definition of the term "sparkplug." A guy with his talent that was a foot taller would be the next Michael Jordan. You never want to be the guy who's assigned to guard Earl. He's simply amazing!
