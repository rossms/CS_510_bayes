Jim Boeheim is finally in the Hall of Fame- where he belongs. He can have no rating less than 5 stars. He's earned every one of them. How fitting that he was joined in enshrinement by his close friend and great rival Jim Calhoun. Two great coaches that also happen to be fine gentlemen. It doesn't get any better for college basketball. Congratulations to Jimmy Boeheim!
