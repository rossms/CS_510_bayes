Ghetto. This place is so horrible. I have been there twice when I was younger, fourth grade and then seventh grade. Both times were equally bad. It is dirty, there isn't much to do, and the people that go there make you realize why other countries make fun of Americans. They have animal attractions, like Tigers that do tricks and stuff like that but then they added rides too. It is in the middle of nowhere. It really isn't worth going to at all.
