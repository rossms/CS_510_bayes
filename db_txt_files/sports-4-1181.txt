Radke is one of the top pitchers in the game today. His success proves the importance of throwing strikes. He doesn't throw particularly hard and he doesn't get a lot of strikeouts. But, he has pinpoint control and gobbles up innings. I know he is below .500 for his career, but look who he has been playing for. There is a reason that all of the contenders have been vying to acquire him, hopeful that the Twins would unload him. Too bad, guys, the Twins just signed him to a four year extension.
