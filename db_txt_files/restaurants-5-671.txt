The best donuts in the world are made at Krispy Kreme. It's one of those things that bring back many memories from childhood. The best type of donut is the regular frosted one when it's made early in the morning and the dough is still warm; WOW, that's great, in fact I may run out and get one right now!! There are also many varieties of donuts that you can choose from: some of my favorites include the Boston Creme, the Jelly Donuts (any flavor of Jelly), and the Chocolate Donut. If you have one nearby (they are spreading to areas outside the southeast), by all means go to Krispy Kreme.
