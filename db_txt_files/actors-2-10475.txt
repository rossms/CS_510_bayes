Great scripts only need mediocre actors to show their worth, and Leon is a classic example of how an actress can be carried by a brilliant movie. Pre-packaged blockbusters like star wars are for making money, and her wooden acting is only exaggereated by the clunky dialogue. Her other movies were not of the same caliber as Leon, and her acting in those was unremarkable. It's good that she wants to have a University degree, but we are rating her acting here, and it is not as if she has the talent to truly move an audience. Which is why I give her two stars.
