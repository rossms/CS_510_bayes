Rick Pitino is the premiere coach in the NCAA. Look what he has done at Louisville in just two years. Look what he has done everywhere in two years in the NCAA. The Cards were ranked as high as number 2 this year... Then NCAA looks at Stone, Myles injury, did they fold? No! they won the conference tourney. Why? Because coaching. Watch how fast Rick moves up this next year...
