I generally avoid McDonald's like the plague because it is always crawling with children and tour buses often stop there. Nostalgia sometimes takes over, though, and I find myself stopping by for a Happy Meal with an orange drink. I have great memories of eating there as a kid, and sometimes I just have to get a quick fix. The food always tastes the same, which is comforting in a certain sort of way, and McDonald's continues to make the best french fries of any fast food chain out there. I don't eat at McDonald's often, but I always enjoy it when I do.
