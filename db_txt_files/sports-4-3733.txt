This is crazy! He's not even the best player of the 90's. Go look at the stats...The Sporting News I agree that Barry Bonds is the best of his era. And A-Rod is already better than Griffey was supposed to be. Griffey's numbers have steadily declined over the last four or five years. He has benefitted from a golden image, but now people look at him realistically since he showed his A@# on the way to the Reds. He's not the best of his era...how can he be in the top 20 of all-time?
