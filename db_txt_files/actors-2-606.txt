Four films and many consider him an acting god. I don't see it. The only movie of the four I liked even a little was Rebel Without a Cause. I don't see any great ability in those 4 roles. A rising star perhaps who met an early demise but a legend that is undeserved. Were he to have done 4 movies in this day and age and then died suddenly he would be remembered about as well as River Phoenix. A product of his generation but not a great talent.
