Jimy Williams is a great manager and works really good with young players. I'm a huge Astros fan, but I was ashamed at all the fans who booed Williams at the 2004 All-Star Game. He did not deserve it one bit. He did everything he could for the team but couldn't give us a playoff team. He deserves a round of applaus for his work with the Astros. I like Phil Garner and I think he'll be good for Houston. I would like to see Williams try his hand in college baseball.
