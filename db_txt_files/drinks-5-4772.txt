Dr. Pepper is probably my second choice after Coke (and definitely before Pepsi most of the time). The drink has a crisp, sweet taste with a hint of bite from a pepperish undertone. While I'm sure diehards can run off a long list of difference between Dr. Pepper and Mr. Pibb, they are pretty much interchangeable for me (as opposed to Coke and Pepsi).
