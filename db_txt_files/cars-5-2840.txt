Ford broke new ground in the domestic performance world by ditching their pushrod engines and introducing their new high-flow modular V8s. This choice has obviosly paid off- the modular V8 in DOHC form creates a whooping 320hp from only 281cubes, without the aid of any forced induction. These new Mustangs accelerate smoothly and smartly, and handle fairly well also. For the price, you can't go wrong. I give this one a 5.
