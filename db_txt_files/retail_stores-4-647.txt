Top quality, but high priced. I did have a good customer service experience there. I bought a shirt at one of their stores (on sale) and the neck shrunk significantly. So, a year or two later, I brought it back, they measured the neck, saw that it had shrunk by over an inch, and gave me a new shirt.
