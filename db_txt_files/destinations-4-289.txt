What a wonderful place with a diverse culture within such a small package. Arts, entertainment, vistas, groovy old residential architecture (weatherboard housing); everything that you could want. The weather here adds to the character of the place. I would have rated it a 5 but the cacophony of vehicle horns from discordant drivers around the city makes me think a bit more patience on the streets would be an asset to Wellington.
