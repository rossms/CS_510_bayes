This is the known low fat candy that lets you enjoy the fact that you are eating candy but with relatively low calories and it is low in fat too. It doesn't have the same sweet qualities that, say a Milky Way has, but it still provides the candy appeal with a thin layer of chocolate covered over a mint pattie. The mint pattie is very sweet but the mint makes you think you are eating a breath mint instead of enjoying the candy aspect. It is still good and if you need to indulge, it is a good way to do it.
