Wow! To me, this book is the epidome of science fiction. It contains everything I love about the genre. When I finished this book, I just stared at the cover for a few minutes, just letting the ending sink in, which was both dismal and uplifting at the same time. It's no wonder that Arthur C. Clarke is one of the most renowned science fiction writers ever. I felt this book was better than his 2001: A Space Odyssey, which seems to get so much more press due to the movie.
