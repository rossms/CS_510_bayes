An above average president, but not a great one. He was extremely intelligent man, with deep and lasting character flaws; in some ways he was a fine president, but his flaws were serious enough to interfere with his statesmanship on occasion. It amazes me how few people on RIA are able to take a balanced view of Clinton --people are still very emotional about him. People who reason with their emotions bother me far more than Clinton and Bush ever will.
