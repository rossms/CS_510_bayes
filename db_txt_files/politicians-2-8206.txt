Overrated much? Yes the cuban missle crisis, he did well but someone had to blink But he really did do good then . Also lets not forget the bay of pigs!!!! He blew that. Yes he was with monroe but he was married it was wrong. Besides that he was president he could have almost anyone he wanted even if he looked like Reno. Sadly his real claim to fame is his assassination, I just have to wonder how that played into camelot and his popularity .
