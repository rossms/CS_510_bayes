I have been to a few WAFFLE HOUSE resturants on vacations and day trips, but I cannot recommend them. The food, while palatable, just isn't very good. This place does not seem to put a high interest in cleanliness, as most are just passably clean. Customer service doesn't seem to be job one, either. Just a cheap and pale imitation of IHOP.
