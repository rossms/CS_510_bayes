trully a class actor..the best is dramas..he was amazin in forrest gump n philadelphia..forrest gump is easily one of the best movies probably ever..very rarely does he not put up a good performance in a movie..even if a movie may be bad one thin u can be assured of is that tom hanks will have acted well in it..apollo 13 is another movie of his where he acted really well..altogether i think he totally deserved all the oscars he received
