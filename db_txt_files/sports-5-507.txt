Actually, Mike Piazza is a well above-average defensive catcher in every respect except for his ability to thow-out base-stealers. Stolen bases are a very over-rated statistic anyway. Piazza calls a great game, stops every pitch in the dirt and hustles his ass off on every play. PLUS, he holds the highest career batting average of any living righthanded batter, and will own every single offensive record for catchers by the time he retires. He's a lock for the Hall of Fame, and a good guy to boot.
