There were no sophisticated measuring devices in the early 1900s, but Walter Johnson's fastball was considered to be in a class by itself. Using a sweeping sidearm delivery, the Big Train fanned 3,508 over a brilliant 21 -year career with the Washington Senators, and his 110 shutouts are more than any pitcher. Despite hurling for losing teams most of his career, he won 417 games - second to Cy Young on the all-time list - and enjoyed 10 successive seasons of 20 or more victories. Walter Johnson was inducted to the National Baseball Hall of Fame in 1936.
