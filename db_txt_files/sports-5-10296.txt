Anyone who can take IOWA to a BCS game deserves 5*s. Anyone who can take a senior QB that had never started a college game and turn him into a Heisman runner up is a 5 star coach. Anyone who can take a team to a 10-2 season with a 3rd string RB deserves 5 stars. If I weren't a Clemson fan I'd be and Iowa fan.
