I have only had one problem with my services being out, and Cox came out the same day for repairs. For those people out there who are complaining about prices/being a monopoly etc.... oh please get over it! if you don't like it, either stop complaining or do something about it! I had DirecTV before and they were horrible! It took them 2 weeks to get out for an install and a week for repair work. Anytime it rained, I lost the picture.... and their internet service was almost 60 bucks........
