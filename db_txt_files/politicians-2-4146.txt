Thanks Nader for abandoning your gay rights causes and all the other good stuff you were doing and launching on your big business is evil rampage! I cannot express my gratitude in mere words, and that is because it doesn't exist! Nader is a total sellout, plus he cost Al Gore the election! While I hate both Gore and Bush, I would without a doubt rather have Gore right now. No more running for president, Ralph S. Mouse. You've had your fun. Take care, everyone!
