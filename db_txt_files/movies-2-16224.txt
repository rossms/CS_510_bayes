A nice try! it is a good idea, could've made a great storyline and excellent movie, unfortunately . . . . . When the movie finished i was left with two feelings: 1) is that it? and 2)thank god that's it! the only reason i gave this movie 2 stars is due to the performance of Samuel L Jackson. It wasn't the kind of character he usually portrays, but yet, still a facinating character whom he plays very well. Still, jackson's performance doesn't seem enough to qualify this film as worth watching.
