I think that Lindsay Korman (Theresa) is a good actress. She has an interesting part on Passions, and I want nothing more for her and Ethan to be together. I am very happy to see her smiling on the show and not crying. Whenever the producers have her cry, she takes it over-board. I sometimes feel like jumping through the screen and give her a good smack and say, OK! THAT'S ENOUGH ALREADY!!!
