A sui generis: Perhaps the most unique player ever -with his vintage, potent skyhook- never before seen and maybe never to be seen ever again, and a very intelligent person. (I saw him EASILY manhandle every contestant on a five-day Jeopardy spree.) The Lakers were my fav. team in the '80s and early '90s and he was one of the main, if not THE MAIN reason why. He was the John McEnroe of basketball; his game was so artful and refined. He still holds the NBA record for the most all-time points scored in a career which I hope that won't be broken by the undeserving 'choker': Karl Malone.
