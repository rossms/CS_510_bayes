This bike is an excellent one overall. It is easily upgradable. The shocks are entry level but high quality and long lasting. Trek is a huge company and can often get parts in large quantities. Therefore, Trek 6000 series are reasonably priced. The aluminum frame is light and springy. The tires are entry level and need to be upgraded for sessions of off road biking. Overall, the bike is excellent and adaptable.
