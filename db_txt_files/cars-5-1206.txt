I got my 2005 Corolla last summer and I have done my share of traveling from Virginia Beach to Roanoke and DC. Each way I can get there on a half of tank of gas. It is so great on gas especially with the high prices on gas I don't have to fill her up too much! I plan on keeping it for a very long time. Great Traveling car indeed! I am very happy with my car!
