Great place to go to see US culture and history. Manhattan alone requires at least a week in order to see everything. I'm glad I saw the WTC in 1997, something I will always remember. I found that there were friendly and unfriendly people just like in any other city. You would have to develop a thick skin in order to live there so it's understandable that not everyone is going to have a howdy neighbor attitude. The Winter season in NYC is truly amazing, the Rockefeller center, the Macy's parade and Broadway at night. Bring lots of $$$.
