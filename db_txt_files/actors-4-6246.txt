I have not seen a lot of Charlton Hestons movies. The ones I did were the big bockbusters of the fiftes. The Ten Commandments. and Ben Hur.He was wonderful as Moses I think he was the ideal actor for playing the hero types from centuries ago. I also remember him in Planet of the Apes as one of the only humans.I think he is a good actor who has done some memorable roles.
