UPDATE: I'm going to have to try their Red Beans and Rice again. So may people have told me how good they are, and a few reviewers have commented on them as well. Maybe it was just a bad batch. Worth a second look. ORIGINAL COMMENT: Their chicken is good, but not as good as Church's. I love Red Beans and Rice, but not theirs. The rest of the stuff is OK.
