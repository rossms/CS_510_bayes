This video had to grow on me a little. Michelle's voice is kind of annoying at first, because it sounds more like she's flirting than singing. But after I watched it again I kinda started to like the video and song. She's just so cute, and for God's sake she plays an instrument which is so refreshing in a teen artist. You just kinda have to root for her. I hope we see more good stuff from her. It's also nice because Michelle looks like a normal person in the video - not like she's covered in baby oil like Britney Spears is in all her videos.
