The first book showed great potential and the characters were interesting. The second book was OK, but by halfway through the third it seemed to me that Jordan had no idea where he was going with this story and was just writing to keep going. I was very disappointed as I was told these were excellent books by people whose opinions I respect. when I gave up with these books I was just plain bored!
