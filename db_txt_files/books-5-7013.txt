One of my favorite books. Hardly a children's story, Watership Down is a story of freedom - a story of having the courage to leave a comfortable existence and fight against the odds to create something of your own. Through the experiences of a renegade group of rabbits leaving a doomed warren to start their own colony, Adams touches on a number of very big, very human issues. One note of warning - this is a very violent, at times warlike book - I would not recommend it for young children.
