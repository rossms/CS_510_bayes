Of all the grape sodas out there, Welch's is by far the best. The store brands, Grape Slice, Grape Fanta, Minute Maid Grape, they all aren't close. You can really tell just by smelling the others they stink like chemicals, but Welch's has that ultimate grape aroma!! Simply the BEST!! I love the stuff!!
