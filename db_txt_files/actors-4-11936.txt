Although her rumored genital tattoo makes me a liiiitttle uncomfortable, for the most part I think she's pretty cool and I admire some facets of her personality. She exudes strength and courage by not caring what anyone thinks. Putting all that aside, I also think she's an excellent actress. Winona Ryder expected to run away with an Oscar for the movie Girl, Uninterrupted but Jolie completely stole the show.
