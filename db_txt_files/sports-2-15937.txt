So you people are implying that Super Bowl rings alone make a good quarterback? Going by that logic, you're saying that Tom I can't throw the ball more than 40 yards Brady is better than Dan Marino? No. The Patriots' defense was the main reason they got to the Super Bowl both times, not Brady. Well, that and the refs.
