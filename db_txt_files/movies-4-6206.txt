I had the pleasure of seing Streetcar on the big screen in a theatre while visiting Washington DC. Vivien Leigh was great up there as all were. Toward the very end when, Stella having had her baby and knew Stanly had probably raped her sister, shunned Stanly saying, Don't you touch me... Don't you ever touch me again! all the guys in the theatre applauded and shouted, Yeah! Right on Woman!
