HLF-PRICE BOOKS IS A GREAT PLACE TO FIND A GREAT BOOK AT BARGAIN PRICES. I'VE EVEN FOUND FIRST-RUN ANNE RICE NOVELS THERE AT 30% OFF. THE ONLY DRAWBACK IS THE SELECTION IS SUBJECT TO A HIT OR MISS METHOD OF PURCHASING. YOU HUNT DOWN A TITLE OR AUTHOR, ONLY TO FIND IT'S NOT ON THE SHELVES. AND, NO, YOU CAN'T SPECIAL ORDER A BOOK.
