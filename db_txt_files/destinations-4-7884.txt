For anyone remotely interested in Chicago history, this is an excellent place to start. It covers the settlers and Indians to the Chicago fire to the present. They cover the types of nature in the area including fish and other creatures. It's a fascinating place for the kids with all of the exhibits but it's just as interesting if not more, for adults. Not many people know about this gem so take advantage of the smaller crowds.
