This is the perfect place for summer tourism. It's not just the beach. If you stay for a week, you'll have a different thing to do every day: trips to Chechen Itsa, Tulum, Merida, Isla Mujeres; snorkling, etc. It's incredibe. Also, the night life is great. The Mexicans there can really teach you how to have fun. In fact, you may not even have time for the beach.
