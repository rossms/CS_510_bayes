I have been a fan of Kentucky basketball for 52 years. today's sorry coaching effort against Louisville was the outcome of a coach not having a team ready to play and a coach who was completely outcoached. Coach Smith completely vanished in the second half. This is a sad,sad day for Kentucky basketball. I can now understand why players don't stay at Kentucky. The coach dosen't know how to use them. I will never watch a Kentucky game again as long as this man is the coach.?
