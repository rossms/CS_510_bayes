They are cheap and drive mahor airlines' prices down, so that is why they get a 2 star rating. I would not fly them however. Kind of scary that more than one of their planes have similar problems. I believe the safest time to fly a particular airline is right after they had a disaster, but i would not hop on one of their flights.
