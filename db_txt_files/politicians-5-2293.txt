Unequivocally, I love General Colin Powell. He is a masterful, courageous, and unflappable diplomat. An asset to the Bush Administraion, Secretary Powell is an inspirational man who embraces any and all challenges that face our nation. He is equitable and balanced. All Americans should appreciate Colin Powell for all that he is, and all that he has done, ethically, morally, and for the world, in general.
