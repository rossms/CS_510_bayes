Bayh is exactly what the Democrats need right now.........plain and simple: a moderate........I'm a Democrat but not a liberal although the party gets stereotyped as such when phonieslike Kerry are nominated who aren't in step w/most things.........anyway, either Bayh or someone to his calibur gets nominated or I'm leaving the Democratic Party and never voting again........politics sucks anyway ;)
