Bought in Oct. 2003 a 2004 Rendevous, love the cargo room, the ride is OK but lots of road noise. Have had in the shop 12 times in 10 months. Most problems with the squeaky brakes. Turned the rotors twice, new pads three times. Also had shimmy at 52 MPS in front end that showed the tires needed to be replaced, now have vibration at 70 MPH. Put extra miles on vehicle as live 200 miles from the dealer so each trip required an overnight stay. As of now am asking for another vehicle, do not trust this one any more. Until Buick gets all the bugs out of the Rendevous would not buy another one.
