When you get right down to it, it was really all about aquiring that cute little dispenser. The strange little so-so tasting rectangular candies were just a side issue. I'd have put lemon drops or red-hots in those if you could have gotten them to pop out right. I'm not a collector of these dispensers but for some reason they still kind of fascinate me even today.
