Tron was a cool movie when it first came out. A lot of what made it cool was the special effects. Nowadays the concept of computers taking over the world has been done to death, but the idea of portraying the internal functions of computers in a militaristic fashion is kind of cool. It's worth seeing, and could logically be considered a classic.
