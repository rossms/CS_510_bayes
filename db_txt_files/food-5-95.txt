Old Fashioned Quaker Oats--More nutrition in these then Quick or Instant. The quicker the cooking time the less nutrition because they mill (roll) the oat into dust. Got this right from the horses mouth when I asked then the difference between each one. Sweeten them the way you want. I can remember as a kid I hated it and would sit at the table for hours refusing to eat it, trying to outlast my mother.
