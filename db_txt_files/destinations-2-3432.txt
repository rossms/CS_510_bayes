I am twenty-nine years old and have lived in Boston all my life! The best thing I can say about my hometown is that you can get pretty much anywhere by public transportation and the fall season is quite beautiful. Other than that it stinks!!! People are self-centered and rude, it is soooo cold in the winter and it is dirty!!!! My husband and I just visited Charleston, SC and wow! what a difference, nice weather, people and it is clean. That is a place I would love to live!!!!
