One of the best books ever. Incredibly subtle. Full of allegories and hidden double meanings. Based loosely in Dante Alighieri s work [mostly The Divine Comedy]. Everything about this books is for the most sophisticated scholars. I loved the ending, as in my opinion is the punch line of the whole story. She couldn't have gone any other way. He was on the end the one person she could depend on and would never fail her.
