Some may think that there are Head Coaches that are better that Barry in the NCAA. That may be true, even though I don't think so, but there has never been a Coach in either the NCAA or Pro sports for that matter, that has so dramatically changed not just a football program, but an entire region. We as Badger fans and alumni, have a sense of Pride about our school and our State that just didn't exsist before Barry. He put us on the map, and did it the right way. BARRY, THANK YOU!!!!!
