I have a problem when placing drive-thru orders. They very often get my order wrong--and it's gets very frustrating... to go back especially when you're on a tight schedule. Like today I ordered my lunch with a donut and they forgot the donut. I understand that the drive-thru orders are busy but it's very important that they get the order right! They should confirm your order at the beginning and before you pay.
