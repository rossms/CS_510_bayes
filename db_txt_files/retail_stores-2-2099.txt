They have a good selection and competitive prices, but every time I walk in to Circuit City I feel like a raw sirloin steak in a cage of starved hyenas. Salespeople descend upon me en masse and it seems like I have to say nope, just browsing about 35 times before I can get any sense of peace. They should say in their advertisements we love when you try the stuff... as long as we're giving you a full sales pitch at the same time!
