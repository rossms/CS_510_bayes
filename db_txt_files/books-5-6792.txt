Riftwar is a fantastic series which gets better and better as it goes along. The plot is well developed and the characters believable. Also most of the sequals are really readable (even the series based on the spin off computer game). It's worth reading them in order though or you won't get whats going on and miss out on the backgrounds of a lot of the characters.
