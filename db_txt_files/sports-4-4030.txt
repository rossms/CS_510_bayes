Ahhh, Dean Smith. The PC media's Moses who led college basketball from the depths of racism all the while walking on water and being a perfect human being. Please. The man was a great coach, but not as good as some say. To be as great as his reputation would give him around eight national championships instead of the two he had to grind out. Was he a social advocate? Who cares. Was he a great coach? Yes, I'll grudgingly give him credit for that.
