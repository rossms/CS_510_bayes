This was a pretty good thrill ride, and the dinosaurs certainly did look real. There's not much meat to the story, but I guess that was beside the point. Anyway, I hated the ending. They just got in the helicopter and left all the dinosaurs on the island. When part two came out, the publicity ads actually had the audacity to say they left something behind . Like THAT was a big surprise to anyone who had seen the first one. DUH!
