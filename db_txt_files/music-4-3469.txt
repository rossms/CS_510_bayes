Somewhat pretentious: Anderson had a beef with organized religion. 4 or 5 of these tracks were AOR staples, but there are some other good tracks such as "My God" on this. I actually find it to be the least interesting of their early albums, this was the 4th. I find the 2nd, "Stand Up," to be the best, though 'Aqualung" is indeed better than the debut "This Was" or the 3rd "Benefit," though both were fine records.
