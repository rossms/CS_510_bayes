Very graphic film (full frontal nudity, lots of language and lots of blood) about a horrific virus which infects people in a matter of seconds, leaving England with only a few survivors and a LOT of zombie-like creatures. Interesting, grainy cinematography, one of the few movies which aren't jam-packed with a ton of special effects (kept to a minimum), and an okay storyline. If you can't handle the nude male figure, a lot of cursing, or a lot of blood, then this isn't for you. Otherwise, I recommend it.
