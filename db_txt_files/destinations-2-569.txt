a) I listen to no one who calls me ignorants. b) there is no arguing the high crime rate in Puerto Rico because it's a fact. The murder rate in San Juan last year (22 per 100,000) is more than 4 times the national average in the US. Crime rose by 25%, with cocaine trafficking being the most common but also kidnapping, robbery, and theft top the list. Puerto Rico is a big war zone. Everywhere, crime seems to be the issue. - Anthony Maingot, Caribbean expert and professor of sociology at FIU.
