Okay..your supposed to be rating an album but instead it turns into a Courtney Love bitch fest. You should like the music (or hate it) for it's sake. FULL STOP. As for Courtney Love so she couldn't save Kurt...it's not her fault. I don't think she killed Kurt and I love him as much as the next person. YOU try helping a depressed junkie not to kill himself.
