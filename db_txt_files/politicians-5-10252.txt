I have never voted republican, but there is no way in hell I am voting for any of the other alternatives. Kerry doesnt know what he believes in he will be pushed by whatever wind is blowing, now that's dangerous. He doesnt know if he is coming or going. Bush has tackled many issues that have many other politicians shaking in their boots because they are to scared to stand up for what they know is right and good for the american public.
