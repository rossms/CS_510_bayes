Year after year, fans continue to believe that the Braves will lose they're reign as the leaders of the NL East. And year after year, fans continue to be DEAD WRONG. The Braves always put out a team with the right chemistry and commitment to win without spending a ridculous amount of money every year (unlike the Yankees). JS apparently knows the formula to success as he knows constructs a team that wins year after year. Not to mention Bobby Cox is one hell of a manager that gets the best effort out of his players.
