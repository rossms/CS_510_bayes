People just do not seem to give Miami the chance that it deserves. Instead of truly finding out what the campus, people and professors are all about the make rash judgements based only on stereotypes. As with any university there is a wide range of people and opportunities. Picking Miami as my home for four years was the greatest choice of my life. I have met the friends I will know for a lifetime and hopefully the woman that I will marry. Go Redhawks
