A beautiful city built on many hills. I did my undergraduate degree across the bay and got to spend many days in this splendid place... if you visit, do yourself a favor and explore beyond the usual tourist ghetto (e.g. Fisherman's Wharf). If you visit in the summer, bring a jacket; the average high temperature in August is lower than Fairbanks, Alaska. Bigots are not welcome here, and many of them have gone away.
