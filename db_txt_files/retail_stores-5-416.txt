Ann Taylor is one of my favorites. The main reason being that it is the only place with consistently attractive clothes for small women...from casual to black tie. Very easy to find petite suits in excellent colors. Sophisticated, simple styles, often elegant. A few fashion mishaps in the summer line but generally reliable. I agree it is a bit overpriced but my clothes from there have lasted quite a while. Not a huge fan of the shoe collection but cute jewelry.
