My experience with Banana has generally been good. The clothes are up to date, yet classic for those wanting work clothes that will make a statement. As well clothes to go out in without revealing too much and still get quite a few compliments. I do not expect to have a personal shopper when I go to a Banana store, as the employees do not work on comission, yet I have had better than average service.
