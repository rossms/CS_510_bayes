I like Matt on Friends but that's about it really. Matt plays Joey, who's a dumb but funny guy, and I think that he's the best at playing these types of characters. When he tries to branch out into other roles, he's just plain awful. It's a case of sticking to what you know best, and Friends is it for him. He should definately consider that spin off, because he won't make it in the movie business. Name one good movie he was in, I certainly can't. The guy has no diversity and that's what you need to succeed.
