This is a well thought out book, and solid in detail. I only reccomend this book, though, to fantasy likers. By that I mean you will enjoy it if you like games like Diablo, D D, Magic, and Baldur's Gate or Icewind Dale. It is somewhat all of those games thrown into a book. Overall though it is great and will give you several hours of entertainment.
