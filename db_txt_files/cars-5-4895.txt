I have driven just about every pickup on the market but when I drove the Tundra I was sold. The ride is smooth and quiet, it has plenty of power, 4-door convenience, very nice interior, and sharp looking exterior. The Tundra is at home on the streets of the city or going down a muddy country road. I would recommend it to anyone.
