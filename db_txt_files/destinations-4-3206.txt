Best weather in continental US. GREAT beaches, laid back attitude. Housing prices have gone nuts in last 5 years. Not affordable anymore, especially considering the jobs in San Diego don't pay squat relative to the cost of living. Also they overdeveloped the North Counties- it's kind of sad to see compared to what it was 10 years ago. Still, a great place to visit and I wish I could afford to live there (comfortably).
