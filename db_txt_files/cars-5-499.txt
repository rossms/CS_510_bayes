Owned a 94 VFR and loved it. Just recently sold the bike. Never had any problems with it. Excellent all-around sport performer. Not the fastest 750 on the road, but much more comfortable and forgiving then the competition. I highly recommend any Honda motorcycle, but the VFR is an excellent blend of sport-bike and touring-bike.
