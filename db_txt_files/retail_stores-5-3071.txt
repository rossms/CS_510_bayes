"Yeah, we got that." Am thrilled they finally dumped this slogan ... at least 3 times I went in looking for something that would seem to belong in such a store and they didn't have it. Nonetheless, good online shopping, with free delivery at a very reasonable $50. Plus their Staple Rewards program is worth another 3% I believe, with overall prices the same as the competition.
