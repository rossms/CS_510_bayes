Want to save a fortune in movie rentals? Go see Mission to Mars! You get 2001, 2010, Contact, LifePod, Apollo 13, Twister, and even a little Star Trek all in one! This movie is a complete and total HACK! It is not the action packed thriller the previews would lead you to believe. Take a pillow and a good book!
