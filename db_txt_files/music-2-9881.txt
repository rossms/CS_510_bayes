Christina is talented, has a greate voice but she thinks she is the best, while she has to admit she isn't. That she is jalous at britney is normal, brit is way better than christina, she's sweet to her fans and respects other. Christina abused britney during an intervieuw. If she was more nicer and not so jalous but satisfied with the things she has, she would be more respected. And even if brit has inplants who says Christina hasn't?
