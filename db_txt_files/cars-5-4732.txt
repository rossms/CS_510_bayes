Great truck. I have a 98 ranger 2wd with 155,000 miles and have had no troubles out of the ordinary. I maintain it regularly, i.e. T-belt, oil changes and other maintance stuff. I've owned GM and Chrystler and neither were as dependable as my ford. I will be buying another ford! Admittedly my 2wd is a 4cyl and is underpowered so I will be opting for a bigger engine next time.
