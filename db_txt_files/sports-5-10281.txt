Let's see...Bob Stoops. Four years as a head coach = four bowl games, two BCS bowl games, three straight New Year's Days bowl games, three consecutive 10+ win seasons, two conference titles, one national title, one Butkus Award winner, one Thorpe Award winner, one Nagurski Award winner, one Heisman Trophy finalist, several All-Americans and academic All-Americans. Oh...and all of those conference titles and another national title as a defensive coordinator at Florida, plus another Thorpe winner, etc. Yep, Stoops is a great coach for sure.
