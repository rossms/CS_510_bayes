Every Tim's have the same problem. Tables are never cleaned, Donuts displays are open therefore flies and people spread their germs mch easier. No paper towels in the wash rooms just blowers,you pull the door open with the use of the door handle, many people do not wash their hands after using the facility. Theirfore another way of spreading germs. All Tim's should be run the same way, every store has their own way of selling the product.
