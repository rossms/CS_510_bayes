Hartford is the Detroit of New England. It's got scary neighborhoods and a bland corporate downtown where the sidewalks roll up after 6:00. It's got a few wealthy suburbs that think they're special and couldn't care less about putting any vibrancy into the city. People in the area think it's coming back just because of a new convention center yet this city lost it's only sports franchise (the NHL: Hartford Whalers) to North Carolina. Sad.
