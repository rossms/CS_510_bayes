ive been watching duke basketball since i can remember jj is my hero you can see the heart that he pours into each and every second of the game and i would do anything to meet him! i play baketball and hope to play for duke one day i love jj and the rest of the team and i dont see how people think that jj is no good. i mean HELLO have you looked at his stats lately what 95% free throw and pure jump-shot form from OVER 40 feet! and that is not all he can do he can get the ball from you just as well as the next person can! jj is the best player in my opinion!
