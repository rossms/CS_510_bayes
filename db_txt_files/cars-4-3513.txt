I have owned several 4x4's over the years and I can without hesitation say the Range Rover is by far the best there is, although I must say some repairs are expensive. However any vehicle these days can be expensive to repair, and every manufacturer has it's trouble spots whether it be japanese, european or domestic, obiviously a good service department makes life easier, but these are the best vehicles for what they are built for!!
