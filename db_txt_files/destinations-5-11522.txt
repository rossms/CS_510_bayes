Beautiful! Don't go if you don't plan to drink. Don't go if you don't plan to party and PLEASE don't go if you have small kids cos it is very Adult. Average price of a club is about 40 dollars for all night open bar. It's really skanky, trashy and loud which can be a plus if your in college and just want some good ol fashion partying. ONly down side is no one speaks english and they try to scam you. It also smells weird and everything is moist.
