Isn;t he dead. I thoiught he has been dead for a couple of years now. Songs from the tomb from Biggy Smalls. I know that recording companies are trying to make more money bu releasing work post-mortum and they might even be trying to do a small service to the fans by putting out new material, but in most cases, the unreleased material was unreleased for a good reason and instead of making fans appreciate the artists talents, it can leave a not-so -great memory in their minds.
