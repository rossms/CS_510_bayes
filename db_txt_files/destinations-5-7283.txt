I lived in Austria and loved it. I only lived there for 1 year but I thought it was an awsome experience. I learned a lot of german. I also am 15 so I liked the freedom their. Austria is so safe. Also the public transportation is great. Instead of having to do what I do in America which is beg my parents to take me some where I could just go; my parents didn't mind because they knew how safe it was. I really loved it and would recommend it to everyone. I don't know anyone who doesn't like Austria. In fact I actually like Austria a whole lot more than America.....not that America is bad..AUSTRIA RULZ
