This sparkeling wine (chamnpagne) is a very good value at between $10 to $12 and only $6 or $7 on sale it is readily availble in you grocery store. It is sweeter & dryer than a brut & most extra dry Champagne, which makes it great for mixing in sweeter champagne cocktails. This sparkleing wine is a great low cost option for those on a budget & for everyday use to share with friends or family. A good $10 gift for the non swirl @ spit crowd.
