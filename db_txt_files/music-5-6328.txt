SOAD is the best thing to happen to music in a long long time. Where else do you find something so unique? Everything else is same old same old... system of a down mixes metal, rock, funky beats and a little regae... you can also find a little swing in there too (of course...i'm talking swing and blues riffs...) Great Cd though...although the first one I think is the best so far.
