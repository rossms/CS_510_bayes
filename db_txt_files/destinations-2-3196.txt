San Diego is loaded with people who are rude, arrogant, condescending, bullying and aggressive--so insufferably pretentious yet so overweeningly provincial. The police are trigger-happy, sadistic thugs, the suburban sprawl is endless and beyond the standard touristy places, there isn't really that much to see or do. The salaries are substandard, the quality of housing so-so and the cost of living is astronomical. America's Finest City? I don't think so.
