I am not sure ANYONE could top Reagan as President but if anyone can its W. He is ethical, decisive,and honest. People say morals should not factor in how a person does their job (Clinton) however I would want other countries knowing MY president MEANS what he says and does what he says he will do! He has been my govenor and did a wonderful job! Mrs. Laura is a beautiful woman who is someone I can relate to and I RESPECT her. Has anyone uttered that word in the White House these last eight years?
