Made in 1983, 22 years later it's still clearly the greatest video of all time. I remember when MTV used to do their Top 100 or Top 500 videos of all time countdowns and this was #1 almost every time until they made a few other videos #1, obviously only to make the countdown more interesting and less predictable. But in reality they knew Thriller was the best.
