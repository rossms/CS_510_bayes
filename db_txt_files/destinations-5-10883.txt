AWESOME! Not as cheesy/expensive as a Disney-World type of place. 11 coasters! (as of this time of writing!) If you want to avoid long lines, go during a monday or tuesday during the summer and reserve a hotel room for the night. (Local hotels will let you check in an hour or so early so that you can go to the park) It's worth it if you love amusement parks. . .otherwise, knock off one star for the long lines for the good rides. Probably my favorite amusement park ever. It's so much fun it seems out of place in a quiet state like Ohio.
