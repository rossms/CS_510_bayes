I have been to Vermont many times- and have never found it to be of the 'deliverence genre' it is yes rural and quiet- but it differs from other rural states further south with its general tolerance of people seeking peace and solitude. There is much sophistication here- and an attitude of leaving others alone- without critical judgement.
