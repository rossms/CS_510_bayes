Tim Allen is a great comedian, but he's not really an actor. He deserves to be in the Top 10 on the Comedians List, but he has not really done too many movies, and the movies that he have done were all comedy films. I really enjoyed his show Home Improvement , and he was also good in The Santa Clause . He was also good in the comedy For Richer or Poorer . However, considering that he is naturally funny, there is no acting involved in his roles. In the final analysis, Tim is a wonderful comedian- but he's NOT an actor, and therefore should not be on this list.
