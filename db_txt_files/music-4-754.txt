I love Tori Amos and I was very excited that this double album was coming out. Once I finally listened to it I was dissapointed by the lack of substance and the confusion of her lyrics. One thing I would tell my friends would be to compare this new album to From the Choirgirl Hotel and notice how the styles are the same, but To Venus and Back doesn't have the same intensity. The second disc is wonderful because it is a compilation of songs from her live shows. This is a Tori fan must have .
