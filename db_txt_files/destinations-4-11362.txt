The Grand Canyon is a beautiful site to see. I have visited twice, once in the spring and once in the winter. It is an amazing geological formation and absolutely worth the visit but unless you are ready for some extreme hiking into the valley there is little reason to stay for more than a day. Oh and don't bring your dog, they are not allowed on any of the trails.
