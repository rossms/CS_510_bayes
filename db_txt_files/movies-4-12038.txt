Looks kind of stupid at first. However, for this film, looks can be decieving. This is actually a very funny movie. Aston Kucher and Sean William Scott play well of each other as the two most ignoramic human beings. Most of the jokes are actually funny and not corny. Check it out sometime. It'll be worth your time and money.
