We bought an 02 sonata GLS with the V6 and are more than plesed with the car. On a recent trip we averaged 27mpg. The car performs great plus we recived a lot of postive comments from people how have ridden in and looked at the car.I am Glad and very well satisfied in buying this car.it had more standard things on it than if I had bought someting else which would have cost a lot more. In all it is a great buy for the money
