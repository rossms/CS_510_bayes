i had always been curious about tolkien but never got around to reading any of his stuff. till this year when i decided to read the hobbit and lord of the rings before the movie came out. and i fell absolutely in love with it. in the intro he confessed he had hoped to evoke the readers emotions through the trip as best he could. and for me he truly did. i almost cried when gandalf fell in the hole and i was so happy when the boys left were safe back in the city when the quest was finally over.. wonderful, wonderful book.
