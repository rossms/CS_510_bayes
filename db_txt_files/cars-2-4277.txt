I have a 2001 V-70 2.4T. This is the first time that I have spent a lot of money on the purchase of a car. This car has been in for maintenance more than any Japanese car that I have had. I can not leave the service department without spending less than $800.00. I am now trading in my Volvo for a car that allows me to spend my time driving the car rather than servicing it.
