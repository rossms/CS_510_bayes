I really, really love this song! As mentioned before, it's uplifting, but not overwhelming. A lovely combination of toe-tapping pop and heartfelt sentiment. (A tricky thing to accomplish, considering how the two are pretty much opposites). It's not hte best song on her CD, which is really very good, but it's still very well done. The video is nice as well. So happy and pretty with the flowers and birds and Nelly overacting. Now if only Francis Lawrence could make all his videos like that.... *cough* 'Jaded' sucked *cough*
