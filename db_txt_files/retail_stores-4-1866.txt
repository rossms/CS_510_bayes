Am I the only person who likes Wal-Mart? I am particularly thankful for the super walmart stores, which stock just about everything imaginable at good prices. I love the convenience of going to one store and being able to do all my shopping. Many are open 24 hours, which is wonderful during the holidays when I don't feel like fighting the crowds.
