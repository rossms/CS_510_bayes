I believe that those who dismiss Pisa as uninteresting or only worth a quick stop to see the Leaning Tower have overlooked the many pleasures of the city. Take the time to explore the piazzas and charming side streets, to talk with the Pisans themselves, and to walk along the Arno at sunset. The city's many bookstores are another reason for a high rating. For a wonderful experience learning Italian, attend the Istituto linguistico Mediterraneo. Byron and Shelley found inspiration in Pisa; you can, too!
