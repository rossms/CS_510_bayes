Time Hortons has recently changed they way they serve peach juice and iced tea. These drinks now come in cans and plastic bottles which is wonderful for the environment and I salut them except one problem I can't find a recycling bin to put them in. I ask where I can put them and they say in the garbage. Call me crazy but that is just plain stupid. I hope they sort through the garbage and take them out but I highly doubt it.
