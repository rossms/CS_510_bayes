When the game is on the line and the other team with the ball is the 90's Chicago Bulls, Walt Frazier is the player I'd assign to guard Michael Jordan. One of the greatest defensive guards and smoothest--make that the coolest-- ball-handler of all time. Walt could score, dish, or pick your wallet when the Knicks needed it most. Say what you may about Willis, but don't deny Walt his props--he's the reason why 2 NBA championship banners hang above the rafters of MSG!
