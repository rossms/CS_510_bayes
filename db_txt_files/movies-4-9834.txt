This movie was just a feel good movie, the acting wasn't that great. But it is one of those rare movies that is meant to make you feel good, and it also portrays how it is possible for people to stay life long best friends, and how easy it really is for people to work together in a good way. I loved it, and I do think it will be a classic movie someday. Lisa Kudrow and Mira Sorvino did wonderful jobs ! I recommend it to everyone !
