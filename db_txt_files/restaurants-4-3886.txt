Great pizza. It's made fresh and right in front of you. Another good thing is that you get to cook it for as long as you want. Whether it's too crispy or too doughy is up to you. But for some reason the people that make my pizza just can't get my name right. Whether by accident or design it's irritating. It's like saying that you aren't worth remembering.
