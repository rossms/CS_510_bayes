I just bought a black 2005 and it is absolutely awesome. Stepping from a highly modded 416EX to this is still an unreal jump. I will agree with everyone that it is extremely difficult to ride technical in first but whoo needs first gear at the dunes. Even with 20 inch 8 paddle edges it still launches hard in second. One thing I would like to add is for all the haters to go away and stick to their yamahas. I dont want them on the same bike as me anyway.
