The Anejo is one of the best buys in Tequila at around $30.00 per bottle at Sam's club and trader Joes. I give this a high rating since it is good enough to drink straight and makes for an incredible margarita (please no Cuervo Margarita Mix!). I always have a bottle of this around. I wouldn't put it up there with the Don Julio or Herredura, but a great value.
