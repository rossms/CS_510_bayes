I actually own a 2001 pontiac trans am firebird, I love the 325 hp and 350 lbs-foot of torque. It handles like a dream...the ppl who gave this car a one are a bunch of communist tree hugging morons without a wallet to afford this fine american car. By the way im 17 and have used my summer job money since i was 6 to pay for this car which i bought used with 18000 miles on her.
