The problem is apparently some people buy a Camaro with hopes of a car with a smooth ride with precision building. You cannot, you have to take it for what it is. The purpose of a Camaro is the V8 grunt you get from under the hood and at the end of the exhaust pipes. There is no better feeling than knowing your car can smoke 90% of the cars on the road (i love to go Mustang hunting in my built up '86 IROC), and being able to light up the tires at any moment. That is why you buy a Camaro, and if you're looking for a smooth ride, go look elsewhere, but don't complain about it after you buy one.
