The chariot race sequence in this film might be 15 of the best minutes in film history. However, the film's not perfect- it's a little old and corny like much of the films from this era. Just a terrific story. . .Ben Hur couldn't be made today with the way films are produced. I'm not a religous person, but I simply enjoyed this story of a person's quest for revenge and redemption. What a shame I only saw it on TV, this film must be magnificent on the big screen.
