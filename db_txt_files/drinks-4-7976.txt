There are two Bushmill's Bushmills White and Bushmills Black. I cant remember which one is the best however its the expensive one. Im not a Whiskey drinker however the expensive one went down fine. Worth spending that few quid more. It can boast to be the oldest working distillery in the world, so they know how to make good whiskey.
