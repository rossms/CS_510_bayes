This team will be back in the playoff race once again and now they have Vladimir Guerrero. California has for the last few years had a stellar outfield, players who can cover a lot of ground and can hit .300 and steal their share of bases. The Angels have also been strong in the bullpen. Last year their starting pitching was the real issue and I believe they will improve on that this season
