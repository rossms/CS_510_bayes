I only got to spend a few hours in Toledo, but what a town! So much history, especially religious history. There's just something about a walled town that feels enchanted. While I was there, there just happened to be a town race. Kids and men of all ages had numbers pinned to their chests and raced down the narrow streets of Toledo to the finish line. It was really a great example of the fun and charming culture there!
