I'm afraid that whatever the author was high on whilst writing this book has seeped through into his work and often the writing style will go from acceptable to downright awful. Judging from the reviews here I'm supposing this was deliberate but in any event I didn't get it and it just seemed fairly pointless, becoming a key element in destroying whatever small ammounts dramatic tension there already was. On top of that some scenes in this book were just so flagrantly... disgusting, even I could no longer bear it and simply stopped reading. Not for the faint hearted, or those who enjoy a well written book.
