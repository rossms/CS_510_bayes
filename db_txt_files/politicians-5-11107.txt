Recently read Miller's book, A National Party No More. Some of it, in the style of any typical politician, is harn-tooting, but overall, if this guy were running as a senator from my state, I'd seriously consider voting for him. He seems to be a Democrat with old-fashioned Democratic values (which, I'm sure, rubs alot of people the wrong way). A Good Old Boy in the best sense of the phrase.
