AC/DC isn't one of my favorite bands, but this album really is good. Most songs by the band played frequently are from Back in Black. It is one of the best selling albums ever. They did it in memory of their fallen lead singer and the dirge-like bells at the beginning of Hell's Bells captures that well.
