Some of you aren't getting it... The Cheesecake factory isn't supposed to be reasonably priced like other places. They aren't targeting the walmart shopper market, they try to attract people with money... Not many places around here will offer valet parking, but this place does and its great on a nice night out. If it's too expensive for your tastes, well, thats because they don't want you to eat there.
