I have never been to Chicago, so I am jumping to some pretty stupid conclusions. Oh well, somebody' got to do it. If Chicago is so good of a place to live, why do all you frickin' Chi-towners move to MN to live off our welfare? We do not need that here, thank you. Please find something to do with them, besides putting them on a bus to Mpls. Other than that, Chicago sounds like a good place to visit.
