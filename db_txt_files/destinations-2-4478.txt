I went here for grad school, and I'm looking forward to leaving. It was cool to be in a big city for once, with many things to do, but after a few months I got really sick of living here. No character unlike Philly or Boston, too many gays and thugs, horrible traffic, very materialistic, and too hot. I want to move back up North and preferably back to the 'burbs.
