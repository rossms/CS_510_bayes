The best part of the movie is when Chris Sarandon shows up in the living room after the mother has invited him in. The sub-text between the two male leads is priceless. This movie is a lot of fun -- the somewhat violent climax of the movie seems a bit out of tone with the first two acts. Definitely worth annual viewing!
