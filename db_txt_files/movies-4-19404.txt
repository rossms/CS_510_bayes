It is really a must for the lovers of Fantasy/Horror Movies, probably one of the few in this genre. The soundtrack is a bit annoying, and takes the fear a bit away.... but watch it alone, in a rainy evening in the dark... and it the atmosphere will get seriously paranormal... It is considered the best of Argento's movies, though I suspect :the bird with the crystal plumage and Deep Red are even more worthy. The latter are more thriller/giallo (early 70s) style, and need some more concentration to follow.
