I think Toronto has gotta be the most hippest, beautiful and interesting city in North America. From the CN Tower, to the Hockey Hall of Fame, theres many things to offer for everyone regardless of age, sex or ethnic origin. This is a real must-visit place for anyone who are plannning to go to Canada.
