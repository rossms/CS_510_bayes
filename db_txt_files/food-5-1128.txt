E.T. was an excellent marketing campaign for Reese's Pieces..definitely made me a fan of the peanut buttery treat. Although, I must admit, they are not my first choice..I seem to forget about them..but when I do spy one of those orange bags, I can inhale the entire contents in about 2 seconds, and savor the texture of the candy shell until it melts away to that lovely creamy peanut butter.
