THE MOST POWERFUL BROWSER EVER! the options are 10 fold more than internet explorer.... like pop-up blockers... seprate tabs to open new pages instead of having alot of seperate windows open.... that really helps free RAM... and it loads pages much faster, has better auto fill in for forms (this is a form! :P LOL I know you know this is!! ) it will remember passwords at alot of sites that IE wont even touch! plus.. it has better email program netspcape mail.. that does more than even outlook does! ok,,, this review can go on for days and this will probably be my last.... take care........
