The handset is sturdy, the keypad lights up, the caller ID on the handset is a fabulous feature. I thought having the window on the back of the handset would be a problem, particularly during programming, but it wasn't so bad. The only problem I have is that there is no handy way to keep a list of saved numbers with the handset. By the way, I am rating the Panasonic KX-TC1711B.
