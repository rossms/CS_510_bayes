I thought this was an excellent war movie and depiction of events that were common during the World War II era. It was suspenful and dramatic without having to be sappy. It shows the courage and determination of individuals to survive when all odds seem to be against them. It also shows a different perspective of WW2 because it takes place on a submarine in the ocean, rather than on land. It's the type of event that movies like Saving Private Ryan or Forrest Gump don't mention. This is a great tribute to those who died at sea during the war, and a great movie to watch on the big screen.
