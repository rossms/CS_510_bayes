I was prepared to like this movie because I like Shakespeare and I had enjoyed Gwyneth Paltrow's performance in Emma. Instead I was disappointed in this movie as I found it a real snoozer. Gwyneth Paltrow's acting in this role was just OK, and not Oscar-worthy-maybe folks are right and she got the Oscar because of her connections.
