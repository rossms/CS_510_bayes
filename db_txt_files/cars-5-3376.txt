I am on my third Jeep, and I LOVE EM' ALL. If you like the ride of a BMW, buy a BMW otherwise if you want the only 'true' American sports car(as quoted by Enzo Ferrari, yes that Ferrari) buy a Jeep. Best offroading vehicle made. The early land rovers were built on Jeep chasis. Imitation is the best form of flattery.
