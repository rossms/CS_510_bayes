WE have a few Blimpies around the area, and they would be my last choice to go for a sub or sandwich. I live right across from a Mr. Subb which makes the best. Subway does it next. Then maybe Blimpie. They only serve subs, no soup and no tator tots or frence fries. The food sin't fresh and lays around all day.
