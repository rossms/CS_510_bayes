I don't know if he's the greatest catcher of all time but he was certainly the best I have seen in my 42 years. He was like Mark Gastineau in that he was a large bulky guy who was shockingly quick. He pounced on balls like a cat leaping out from behind the plate. And I hated the Reds. I was a Dodger fan during the days of the Big Red Machine ... you just have to give this guy credit. He was a fabulous catcher.
