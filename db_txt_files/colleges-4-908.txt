Graduate Student: I'm enrolled in one of DeVry's graduate level programs. I thought it would be easy, but have found just the opposite. In reviewing information from other graduate programs [U-of-H & Texas A&M], DeVry appears to be requiring you to delivery similar work to the traditional classroom study at these campuses. My suggestion to anyone evaluating DeVry programs, is to checkout a few other universities before deciding. You might be surprised to find out that DeVry is not a push over. Good luck in any decision you make.
