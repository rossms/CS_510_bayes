Positively amazing! A city that not many people in the world know about which would have to be amongst (if not the!) the worlds cleanest, most pleasant, stylish and well fed. And somehow the people have time to be friendly. This city could teach almost every other city in the world a thing or two about mixing different cultures too. The locals do seem rather obsessive about their football though.
