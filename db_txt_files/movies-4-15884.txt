Yeah, the storyline is overdone, and there was nothing new about it, but it was done fairly well and it was pretty fun to watch, much to my surprise. I thought it would be one of those movies that would be just an excuse to throw togther as many top-name actors in one flick as they could, but I admit I didn't give it enough credit. Nothing spectacular, but fun to watch nonetheless.
