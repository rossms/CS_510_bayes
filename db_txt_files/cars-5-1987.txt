i have owned both the g35 coupe and the g35 sedan. the coupe, imo, is a porsche 911 equivalent for a fraction of the cost. it is a beautiful car with outstanding performance characteristics. the only thing i can ding it on is the interior finish (the fake titanium coating on top of the plastic, puh-leeze). the sedan... just great. the handling is a come-down from the coupe, but only by a hair. it's outstanding for a sports sedan. rocket fast (bizarrely, the auto sedan feels faster than the auto coupe), brakes on a dime, and rides comfortably. there's a lot to like w/both cars and they're both great values.
