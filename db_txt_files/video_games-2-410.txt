Oh Roberta, what were you thinking? You took an amazing adventure franchise and tried to turn it into a shooter style game. Where is the enchantment you gave us in the previous games? Why does the entire game have to be so dark? Where is the great dialog from your previous games? Roberta, you should have really thought twice before releasing this game and putting Kings Quest on the box.
