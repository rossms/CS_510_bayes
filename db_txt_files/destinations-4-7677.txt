The Babe Ruth museum is in the house Babe Ruth was born in, and it is located near Camden Yards. Its a good place to go if you are spending the day in Baltimore before a baseball game. In addition to the stuff about Ruth, they have a lot of memorabilia about Baltimore sports history, especially about the Orioles and John Unitas.
