Well its kind of hard to group these. First you have the really good ones like The Voyage of the Dawn Treader, The Lion Witch and the Wardrobe, Prince Caspian, and such. And then you have the mediocre ones which are still okay like The Last Battle and The Silver chair, so they all balence each other out.
