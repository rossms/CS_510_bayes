Jon Gruden is probably one of the greatest coaches of all time, when you look at all that he accomplished with the Raiders, then to go on to the Buccaneers and win the Super Bowl his first year on the job shows his incredible ability, not to mention that he is the youngest coach to ever win a Super Bowl. I believe that he will be studied for many years regarding his hard work ethic, leadership capabilities, and offensive genius. Truly a coach of the ages.
