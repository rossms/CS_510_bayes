as an actress, i think she's not spectacular, but definitely above average. i thought she was awesome in thelma louise and she did a cool job in league of their own and long kiss goodnight. she's got potential i think maybe she just needs concentrate on picking the right roles. i was impressed with that archery thing, too.
