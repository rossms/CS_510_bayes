Doom does what it does better than any other game that has attempted to do so. Now, I'm not talking about the new breed of action games like Quake and Unreal; I'm talking about simple, two dimensional, boom-your-dead, action games. A ton of other games have attempted to copy Doom, but the original rises above all the rest. This classic is the reigning king of all action games. While the weak sci-fi plot is unoriginal, the game is all about action. It is simple, mindless, and fun. You should pick it up if you see it somewhere.
