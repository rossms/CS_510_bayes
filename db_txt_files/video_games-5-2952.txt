Simple put, it is an amazing game. The missions itself are great but, the added extras, the fact that you can ride around without limitation on time, things like rampages and side jobs through the payphones, etc. really set the game apart from any other. It is graphic, but it is also complex and it is a long game, but not in a bad way. There are just so many different paths to take, literally and figuratively. If you can get over the violence, the game is one of the best titles for any system ever.
