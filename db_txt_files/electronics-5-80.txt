I really like the Sony. It is easy to use without an aboundant of buttons to confuse the customer. I like the setting mode which allows you to play your favorite song over and over and over agian. The Sony CDP Series works well and the quality of the stereo lasts. My Sony still plays as if it were new and its already been almost 3 years.
