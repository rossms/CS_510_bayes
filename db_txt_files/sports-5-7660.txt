I never even liked the guy, but for him to be way down here on the list??? Come on!! He's a NINE TIME ALL STAR, he won THREE CHAMPIONSHIPS (& was awarded finals MVP those three times), and he's got 26.9 points, 12 rebounds, 3 assists, & 3 blocks as CAREER AVERAGES!!! Now Miami's gone from a second rate team to the BEST IN THE EAST, and look at the sorry Lakers now. He gets five stars for his dominance from me.
