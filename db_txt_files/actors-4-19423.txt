John Lithgow is an above average actor. I liked his creepy performance in Twighlight Zone: The Movie . He is quite versatile, and I enjoyed his performance for the most part on Third Rock from the Sun . Mr. Lithgow is very underrated, and if given the right leading role may be able to make a name for himself in Hollywood.
