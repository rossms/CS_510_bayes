he is the greatest player to ever play the game of basketball. he knew what he ahd to do on the court to get the job done. i have to say that he would not be the player he is today if it wasn't for Phil Jackson. He developed Jordan's game into a player that a hurt an opponent many ways on the court even defensively. Jackson installed the triangle offense that took some of the offensive pressure off and got his teammates involved to. All and all Micheal Jordan was the greatest to ever play the game of basketball.
