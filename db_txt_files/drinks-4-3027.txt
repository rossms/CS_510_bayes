Okay first, let's dispell all of the silly myths here: 1. Sugar does not cause any sort of hyperactivity. this is a myth. 2. There are 2 versions of red bull, one with sugar (corn syrup) and one without. take your pick. 3. Caffeinated drinks are NOT thirst quenching as one person said. They are just the opposite. They dehydrate you. Nonetheless, if you want to stay awake, Red Bull works just as well as any other energy drink because of the caffeine.
