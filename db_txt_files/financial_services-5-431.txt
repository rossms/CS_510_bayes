I've been investing in Janus funds for about three years now, and the experience has been great. Even in this ridiculous bull market, Janus funds manage to exceed expectations, almost across the board. I invested in Janus Worldwide and Janus Global Technology, both of which have done extremely well. The Global Technology fund, in particular, has skyrocketed (although the recent correction brought it somewhat back down to earth). Janus' next big challenge is to prove they can consistently excel in a bear market as easily as they excelled in a bull market.
