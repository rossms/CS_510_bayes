You have to admire this man who overcame a difficult past, for doing such a good job with this team. It's especially significant since he's at OSU, a college that receives little support from the press in Oklahoma (their bias in favor of OU practically screams at you). I'm happy to see that my favorite college has one of my all-time favorite coaches..
