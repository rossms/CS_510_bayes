Duvall never impressed me. I can understand how many enjoy his work and consider him great but every role I can recall him playing was just depressing. The way he acted or the character itself. I am not really sure. I rarely look to movies for inspiration and certainly wouldn't want to be depressed. Maybe it is just his role/movie choices. His work is quality, just not the type I enjoy.
