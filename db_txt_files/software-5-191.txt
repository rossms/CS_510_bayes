Switched to Opera after having my fill of Firefox, so far it's much faster and I like the interface, time will tell if I will pay for the software to get rid of the ad banner(s). Firefox is free, but remember the saying, you get what you pay for, the free version of Opera already works better then Firefox speedwise, don't know if paying for it will make it any better?
