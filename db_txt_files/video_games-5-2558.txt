over all i had always loved the version for the nintendo 64 but the DS one is awsome! much more levels like 30 more stars or something and more playable characters and there all pretty cool! great 3D levels and my most favoirt of all is the mini games most of them are better then the ones on wario ware toched! overall my faviot DS game that been released so far but there be better ones like new 3D shooting games that will come out!!bad things well i thought that the comtrolls could be better but as you get use to the DS the become perfect over time great game A MUST BUY!!
