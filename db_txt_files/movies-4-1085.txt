Though not for everyone, Fargo is the type of movie that gets better each time you watch it. The first time you see it you get too caught up in the accents and weird vernacular used by the characters. By the second and third time, you notice the humor and how well written it is. The entire cast is great, particularly Frances McDormand and William Macy. However, there really isn't much of a need for you to rent it. It seems like it is on almost monthly on TNT and since there isn't much profanity or nudity, you won't miss much.
