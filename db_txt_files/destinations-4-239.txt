well i gotta give this place a good rating since my mom's from the philippines and it's the only other asian city i've been to. the people are friendly and almost everybody speaks english. however manila has all the inherent problems of a third-world metropolis. so i'd recommend bagio (i think i'm spelling it right). it's a smaller town in the north that's a bit cleaner.
