I can eat a whole movie sized bag of these easily! I absolutely am addicted to crisps and Doritos are a favourite. We had Mexican flavour for a while and that was absolutely divine - can't find them anymore which is really annoying. Pizza flavour is really nice, but you can't beat the good old cheesy and the cool original flavours.
