recently in the york,pa rest.and we had excellent service, our waiter Steven told us that they usually have 3 tables each,but he request that the host only to give him 2 so that he can give a more quality service, and you can bet we tipped him well for that. He kept us informed, guided us to best tasting meals and kept our bev. topped off - we request him everytime.
