We have had one at the University where I work. All in town driving with some trips. Older design but pretty rugged good engine 4.3 L v6. Had to replace the switch that allow it to go into gear when you step on the brake. Broke 2 times. Not enough footroom on the front passenger side. Very reliable. Fairly comfortable on the highway and manuverable in town much better than the larger full size vans. Better visibility as well. We liked it enough to buy a 2003 year model.
