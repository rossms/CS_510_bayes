I do not get why Ebert and Roper give thumbs down on this movie and why some of my local newspapers give it just 2 stars. This is one of a kind, butit is ceratin that it will not match X-Men and Spider Man as the all time best from Marvel Comics, but it is one that the family can enjoy despite that it is rated PG-13. Funny at times, somewhat suspenseful, but the action and drama does fill in some of the gaps. This is good, but not great (I will see the mid 1990's version soon to compare); but hey, one star for each team member sounds fitting for this movie, eh?
