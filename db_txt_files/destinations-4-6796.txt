The few times I have visited Nebraska, I really enjoyed it. The people in Nebraska basically keep to themselves, mind their own business, and don't do anything to anyone else. I really love the people in Nebraska, I have alot of family and friends there, and they are always down-to-earth. I always love going to Lincoln as well, a very beautiful, clean city with a really nice skyline. The capital building is also an awesome sight to look at. Visit Nebraska if you want peace and quiet, and want to visit some decent people.......the cities and the country have alot to offer...
