Seriously fun all the way through with tidy casting. You can tell they put money into the special effects, as they don't look like anything else anywhere else. Off-kilter pacing, which presents a challenge to many viewers, but if you were looking for something to liven up a boring weekend, this'd be in my Top Five.
