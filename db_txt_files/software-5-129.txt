I haven't needed to contact customer service yet, and I hope it stays that way. Quicken does what I need it to, which isn't much. Good program as long as you don't need to pay for it. (It came with my computer). When and if Quicken makes me pay the 60 or 70 dollars to get the newest version I think I'll just balance my checking and savings accounts the old fashioned way.
