2000 model. Better than a Range rover, but had problems with engine stopping while driving at highway speed. Must put in park to restart, which is hard to do in fast lane of interstate. Had 4 incidents like this over one year. Dealer finaly took car back. Good service from dealer, but service Mgr. had other vehicles with same problems. I no longer drive a MB.
