It took alot of talent and genius to win a revolution against a power as strong as Britain was back then. And then to get a nation started from a bunch of colonies who all thought themselves as seperate nations was truely extraodinary. To use a cliche, he must be turning in his grave to see this nation in the state it is in now and with a man like Clinton as its leader.
