I test drove many makes and models before choosing the Marauder, including europians such as BMW and Mercedes. Although models from those two would undoubtedly out perform this car, for the money there is no American or Europian made sedan, including any Chrysler, and especially the Monte carlo( witch couldn't seem to be able to get out of it's own way!) that could compare. I think it's a great buy.
