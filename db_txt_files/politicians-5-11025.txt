I'll start the bandwagon and say that the smartest person elected to the senate will do a great job. If he does not, I will change my vote, but I would be shocked if that happened. A brilliant man that will be a great Senator and hopefully one day a great president. Mr Political, if the majority of americans saw this, why did Obama get 74% of the Illinois vote?
