I am very surprised that he is even on this list, the only thing he could ever do is rebound. He got away with so many fouls it is and will always be unbeleivable. He did have a talent of somehow getting a rebound on the hard floor but... I don't think he even deserves a chance to earn bids with the big dogs -- when it comes to overall performance that is.
