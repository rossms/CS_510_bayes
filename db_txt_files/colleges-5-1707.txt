Seriously, the only way to experience this university is to come take a tour of its area in the city. Don't listen to the people who complain about it yet got rejected from it. Listen to the people who are here, and most of them can't get enough of it. The only thing you really need to know is that it is not the typical college experience. You're going to do things, you're not going to sit in your dorm room and play video games all day. It is LIFE and it is AMAZING.
