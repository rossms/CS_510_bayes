As soon as I knew that Gore was going to be the nominee, I knew that I would like his VP choice more than I like him. That is certainly the case with respect to Lieberman. Lieberman is an experienced public servant (CT Attorney General and two term senator) and is not afraid to go against the Democratic tide if his beliefs dictate it. I have also seen him on Politically Incorrect on a number of occasions and, each time, he has come across as an intelligent, thoughtful, and compassionate man with a good sense of humor. Now, if only he could be the presidential nominee.
