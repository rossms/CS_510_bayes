My family just got back from 2 weeks in Alaska including a 4-night stay north of Denali. The park was gorgeous! We took the 10:30 a.m. shuttle bus tour in the park and also did several of the smaller hikes at the entrance. Our driver/guide on the 6-hour shuttle ride was fantastic!! We stayed at a great Lodge/cabin area in Healy...just north of the park called Earth Song Lodge. We would highly recommend it and next door was the Jon & Karin's Henry's Coffee House. A trip of a lifetime!!
