Probably their best album. After 5 years away they've come back stronger than ever and tracks like it's my life, captain crash..,and say it isn't so just go to show that they're moving with the times but not betraying their roots. I never get tired of listeneing to this album. The only weak link on the whole album is probably She's A Mystery. It's too slow! Apart from that a quality album all round.
