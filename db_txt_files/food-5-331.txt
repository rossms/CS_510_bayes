Honey Nut Cheerios has withstood the test of time in my household, and now it's a weekly staple. My husband and I love its not-too-sweet, nutty flavor. It's great for breakfast, and I also enjoy having it for a quick snack. I had regular Cheerios for breakfast this morning, and I found myself yearning for the jazzier flavor of Honey Nut Cheerios.
