On the debate last week. . He didn't look like a President, answer questions like a President, nor did he come across as the President. Instead, he repeated himself over and over again and many times looked like a little boy who is put on time out, making faces, batting his eyes . . Shame. Wake up America, another 4 years of him and there will be no more middle class Americans ! !
