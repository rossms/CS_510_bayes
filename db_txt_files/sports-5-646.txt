One of the most prolific throwing arms I've seen since I don't know when. I'm sure, somewhere out there, there are some Cubs fans who are still regretting that Chi-town got rid of him as they did in the early 90s, before he could prove himself. I can't stand the Braves but I respect this guy (future Hall-Of-Famer).
