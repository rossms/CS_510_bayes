The Nokia 6100 Series is a great all around phone that is packed with some useful features. It stores up to 199 names and numbers, has a calendar feature for those important dates and meetings, and a lengthy battery life of 2-3 days. The phone comes in a variety of colors from plain black, to what are called chameleon colors: earth, sky and ocean. With a one year warranty, compact size, and accessories easily available at most phone outlets, it is a good buy.
