He's BIG...but NOT a team player and whines too much about calls. He gets away with more offensive fouls than ANYONE else in the NBA. I'm tired of hearing about how difficult he is to officiate...he doesn't get different rules because he's huge - BLOW the whistle...if he shoves someone out of his way on his way to the hoop ... that's a foul - CALL IT! I LOVE to watch Yao take him to school!!!
