Munich didn't thrill me too much. I was here on New Year's Day and it was basically filled with drunk college students. Hostels were staffed with rude people, the food was either bad or overpriced, and there wasn't much to see outside of the bottom of a beer stein. Dachau was creepy, but the tour guide was as engaging as a bucket of sawdust.
