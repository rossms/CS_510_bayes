This is a fantastic area to be outside and active. You've got great fly fishing, rafting, river kayaking, EXCELLENT skiing, ranchs for riding trips, yellowstone is just 60 miles north, a great old western town, and some of the most beautiful mountains around, perfect for hiking, trekking and camping. Oh don't forget paragliding from the ski slopes down into town or elsewhere.
