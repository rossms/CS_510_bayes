Just got back from Freeport. Went out with a company Exotic adventures.It was the most AWESOME time I have ever had. Fresh lobster and fish for lunch. Cooked right their on the beach. The captian speared it all that day for us. We even got to go an a treasure hunt for rum(all you can drink and eat). You have to check out their web sight exoticadventuresbahamas.com. It is a blast.
