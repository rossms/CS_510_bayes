John Ashcroft was unequivocally the best choice for Attorney General. Brave, articulate, highly intelligent, he is the perfect complement to a President who seeks to protect life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. Mr. Ashcroft is a pious man, and I trust him with our security, despite the pundits who claim he trounces on civil liberties. Yes, civil liberties are important, but when people take advantage of their civil liberties, a free and democrat society can be chipped away by attrition.
