I made an appointment with them on short notice, which was cool. However, when the time came for them to be there they weren't. Apparently their car broke down and they didn't have a backup crew available. I know it isn't their fault, but how about something like If you move again we'll give you a 10% discount. Nope. All I got was a Sorry.
