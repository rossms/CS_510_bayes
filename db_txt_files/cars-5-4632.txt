I have a 2001 F-150 XLT with the Off Road package. It now has over 91,000 miles on it and not a bit of trouble. Only defective part I have replaced is a blinker bulb. This truck has pleanty of power, rides and handles well. If you are thinking of buying a full size light duty truck you must test drive a Ford.
