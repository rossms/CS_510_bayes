Total is missing something really important- taste. I know it contains 100% of every vitamin and mineral your body could want, but that doesn't compensate for the fact that the flakes taste like compressed cardboard. I've tried disguising Total with banana slices and lots of sugar, to no avail. My recommendation is to take a multivitamin and enjoy a bowl of cereal that actually tastes good.
