i like penna. i didn't grow up here, but it's where i live now. there are a lot of rednecks, and a lot of road construction, but for the most part the people are friendly. the air is clean, there are lots of farms and forests, and there are numerous historical sites. the winters are honestly a bit cold for my liking, but beside that, it's a pretty nice place.
