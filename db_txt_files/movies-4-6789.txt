To me this is about a 4.5. Funnier than I thought it would be.MontyPython is known for their off the wall comedy.and this one is just as funny. the monty python troup is off to find the Holy grail, and encounter different funny obatacles along the way, the viscious attack bunny rabbit,the trolllike man at the bridge, most of the men are cowards who are known to holler run away run away when they encounter any kind of danger. a lot of good and funny british actors. a fun movie to watch when you would like to have a good laugh.
