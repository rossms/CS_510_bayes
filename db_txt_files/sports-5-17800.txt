I have been a Washington Redskin fan for almost 50 years. Do or die they will always be my team. I was elated to finally get to see them beat Dallas this year! I don't care if they lose every other game as long as they beat Dallas I can get some satisfaction. I certainly hope that we can get it together next season. Finally, I love you Darrell Green. You will be greatly missed!
