Yeah, they had a weak schedule that first superbowl win, but this year they played 9 games, and won, against teams with 10 or more wins at the end of the season. They beat the 2 co-MVP's - twice. They will have Ty Law this year, he's under contract. If he throws this season then he's cutting his own throat, everyone will blame it on his being old and they won't pay the cash he's looking for. The Patriots have the best overall team, that's all there is to that.
