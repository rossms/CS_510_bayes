Stephanie... there are times when you love her. She's a great family woman, and when she loves someone, she would do anything for them. However, if she doesn't like someone--stay out of her way! She can sometimes be stubborn and downright dirty, but it's always for someone that she does love... she doesn't do it simply for the sake of being mean, but she does what she believes is in her family's best interest... whatever it may mean for the other party. Susan does a great job as Stephanie.
