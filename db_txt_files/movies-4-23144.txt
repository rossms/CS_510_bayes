Attention viewers! Do not attempt to watch this movie while on any sort of hallucingenic drugs....the muppets alone will scare the wazoo out of you. Not to mention David Bowie who is even more scary here than he is in real life. But really the thing to watch for here are Jim Henson's creations. They're spectacular, although bound to give on nightmares. Just keep thinking, Bert and Ernie, Bert and Ernie.
