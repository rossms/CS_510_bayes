I didn't know too much about Alan Keyes until I heard him speak on televsion several months ago. I ran downstairs to tell my husband that I had just been inspired by this incredibly articulate and intelligient black man! I wasws thinking that he would make such a wonderful president- he is so gifted, so confident, so inspiring. I am eager to hear him and read about him and support him in any way I can if he runs again for political office. In the meantime, I am very happy with our new president- I think he is doing a great job!
