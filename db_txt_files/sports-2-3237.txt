ok, you all need to look at the facts. Hank Aaron played 23 yrs. NO 50 hr yrs, 12364 at bats, ruth had 8399 at bats with 714 hr. when aaron had 8399 ab, he didnt even have 500 Home Runs. To they people that think he is the best hr hitter ever, you are IDIOTS! just because he has the most hr, doesnt make him the best hr hitter ever. I dont even rank him in the top 5 greatest pure hr hitters ever. I also cant stand people who stay around for records. Hope this helps all you people who dont know the facts except for how many home runs they hit.
