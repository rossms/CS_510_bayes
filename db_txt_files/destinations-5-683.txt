I think there is no beach anywhere on earth that's quite as soft or beautiful as Cancun's. Powdery white sand is soft as flour and never seems to feel hot to me, no matter how fierce the afternoon sun gets. The crystal clear blue-green waters are justly famous among snorklers and divers. Lots of nightlife and restaurants, but they tilt towards American tastes. If you're after authentic Mexican culture, Cancun is the wrong place for you.
