This is a fabulous book that I've just devoured in the last two days. Peggy Noonan explains very methodically why New Yorkers should reject Hillary at the ballot box. And she does it in a way that's very generous to Hillary supporters, liberals in general, and even Hillary herself. The anti-Hillary crowd will eat this up, but its much more important that the on-the-fencers open their minds to an articulate and fair-minded person like Peggy Noonan make the against case. If they choose to pass it up, believing it's right wing venom as the Clintons dismiss every critique of them, it will be their loss.
