KOBE IS A GREAT PLAYER BUT ALSO A LITTLE SELFISH.GIVE HIM TIME I GUESS.OBVIOUSLY MR.LUCKY LUCIANO DIDN'T SEE THE LAST 76ERS-LAKERS GAME WHEN ALLEN TORCHED KOBE FOR 40 PLUS PTS.AND KOBE COMPLAINED OF BEING TIRED.SHAQ ADDED, HE IS YOUNG HE SHOULDN'T BE TIRED .WAKE UP LUCIANO AND GET OFF THE BANDWAGON'S!
