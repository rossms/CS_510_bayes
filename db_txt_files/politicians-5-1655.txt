Jimmy Carter is a great man. I disagreed with many of his policies when he was in office, but in retrospect, I rtealized that he always followed his conscience. That's why he was not a good president, because the average political weasel will bury you if you don't play his game. Jimmy Carter marches to his own tune. We will never see another president like him because a man of integrity will never be able to fight his way through the obstacles placed in front of him by partisan politicians. The only president in my time to leave office with his soul intact.
