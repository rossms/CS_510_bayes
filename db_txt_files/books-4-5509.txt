This novel was good news for those of us who were gagging to hear more from Bridget and had read the first book just too many times. By itself, the book was relatively entertaining and has some brilliant moments in (eg. interview with Colin Firth, based on a real interview with the actor!). Only problem is, if you really enjoyed the first book, this one is bound to be a let-down, because it simply isn't as original. If you liked the first one, read this, if not, stay away.
