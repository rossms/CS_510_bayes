My favorite city in Europe. The buildings are completely untouched by the devastation of WW2, so the historical sections of the city aren't much different now that they were a very long time ago. Beautiful women with amazing accents seem to be everywhere. Beer is 25 cents. Viva the Velvet Revolution!
