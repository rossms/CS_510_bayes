i thought this movie was good, not great...good! i really like the story of sleepy hollow, it kinda took me a while to understand it since i've never seen the cartoon version. i think the movie would have been better had it of looked more real. i mean when the heads got chopped of and lilke rolled on the ground, it was just so fake looking. it could have been more bloodier.
