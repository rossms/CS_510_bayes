London is fantastic! It is also a greater starter place for tourists who have never been out of the USA. To make the sights even more interesting, I recommend watching a movie such as Elizabeth 1 or reading a book about Henry VIII before you visit. That will peak your interest. Don't miss Trafalger Square--unless you're afraid of pigeons. There are thousands of pigeons who will eat from your had and land on your shoulders. It's great fun if you don't have a pigeon aversion.
