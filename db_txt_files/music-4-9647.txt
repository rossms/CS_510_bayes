The first time I heard Ray of Light, I really didn't like it. But after listening to it a few times, it really grew on me. The trippy electronica sounds are pretty relaxing, and Madonna's voice is incredible. My favorite tracks are Ray of Light, Swim, and Candy Perfume Girl. Since I really enjoyed this CD, I have high hopes for Music.
