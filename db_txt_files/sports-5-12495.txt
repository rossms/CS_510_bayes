Congrats to Miami for playing a good hard-nosed game against Florida. Back in '92 it was very easy to dispise Miami. Their swaggering thuglike behavior alienated most of the country. Their humiliation by Alabama in the Sugar Bowl was welcomed by millions of people. However, the Miami team I watched the other night was tough, highly disciplined, and sportsmanlike, they earned a good victory and are to be congratulated.
