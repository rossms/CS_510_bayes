Just a surreal experience.It is impossible to fully understand where you are standing and what actually took place there on Dec. 7,1941.Very well worth the trip over.The intro video before going over to the USS Arizona is very informative and interesting.You may get lucky like I did and meet some of the survivors who volunteer from time to time at the park.
