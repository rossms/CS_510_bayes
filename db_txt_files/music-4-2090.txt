Although not his best, this is an excellent album. On first listen i didn't really think too much, i reckoned it was quite musically conservative compared to his recent stuff. After another propper listen, all the way through, the thing that struck me were the orchestrations. Actually some of the best orchestrations put over any music in a long time. Kind of like a slightly more depressed Arthur Lee's Love. The songs really flow gently, like a river.Its his most emotional work to date.
