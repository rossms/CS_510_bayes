It is a shame that the only man in Washington with a brain has heart trouble. I watch him frequently on television, and he has never failed to give an intelligent answer to any question posed. Besides being intelligent, he is honest. He directly answered No, I do not. when asked if he respected Louis Farrakhan. What other answer can a White male honestly give? Would you prefer someone who kisses the ring of such filth, like Al Gore did to Reverend Al Sharpton? (Real Reverends don't promote hatred.) Cheney for President, as soon as possible!
