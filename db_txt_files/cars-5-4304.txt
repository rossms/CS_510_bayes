The G.M. mini-vans while not as reliable as the Honda they have more standard features for less. As I have been told by many people you can not base what really happens in an accident on crash tests because no two cars break the same. My mom has had two Silhouettes ('97 and '01) and loves them. When Olds. goes out of business in '04 you will still be able to get parts for them at any G.M. dealership. So don't let that be your deciding factor of this wonderful mini-van.
