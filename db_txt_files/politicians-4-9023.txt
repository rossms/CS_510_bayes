I think history will get beyond the sex mess of Clinton's administration and see him for the good president he was. In his administration, employment was up and economic times were good. In spite of what some people may say, President Clinton really cared about people and he did his best to be there for the country. I believe he has a definite character flaw and he got caught with it which is the tragedy of the man.
