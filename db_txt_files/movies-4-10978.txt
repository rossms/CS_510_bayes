This movie was pretty good, but I felt like I was watching Mrs Doubtfire . The plot was predictable all the way up until the ending, but there certainly was some good comedy in this film, such as the scene where Big Momma and Sheri are in the bed together. Martin Lawrence was great in this film, making it one of the funniest films of 2000.
