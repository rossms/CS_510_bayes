I liked this movie because it appealed to those who like romantic comedies, which was not what it's commercials entailed. The commercials seemed to portray that the movie would appeal more to males in the sense that the movie was only about half naked ladies dancing in a bar. It did have a plot and a nice romance to go with it.
