all i have to say about this one is...haha. a carolina boy on the streets. would you be referring to the big, bad streets of Chapel Hill? what comes to mind is a clean shaven white kid wearing a baby blue polo shirt, cargo shorts, and some rainbow sandals walking down Franklin Street. Not that i'm an advocate of the scary face or anything, but come on. anyway, he's great, acc player of the year, etc. pleasure to watch.
