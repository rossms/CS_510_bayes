This is hardly more expensive than places like McDonalds, so quit complaining about that people. Believe me, it's worth the extra 50 cents or so. Unlike McDonalds, Burger King, and Wendy's, the chicken tastes like real chicken! This is great tasting chicken! The waffle fries are almost as good as McDonalds fries as well. If you've never eaten here, try it. It's super!
