I know its close to sacrilege to praise Costner on here, but I liked this movie. Very well filmed, well written and well acted. Duvall is particularly strong, but Costner is very good, and his portrayal of the man haunted by his past is very credible. Not one of the great westerns of all time, but far better than average.
