JJ Redick is the best college basketball player in the country. Every time the game is on the line JJ is there to make sure Duke wins. He is the captain of the Duke squad for a reason. He hit up 41 points after evryone was predicting an upset. If you don't think he is the best I do understand a little bit if you are rooting for Adam Morrison. No exception besides Adam Morrison. Duke will win it all this year and if you don't think this your stupid.
