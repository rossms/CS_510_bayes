As far as department stores go, the quality of Meijers goes above and beyond places like Wal-Mart. Spotlessly clean and well-lit, it offers low prices on food, electronics and whatever else you need. Unlike other dept. stores, it has a wealth of helpful employees and you manage to shop there without pulling out your hair. Its almost enjoyable to shop at Meijers and that's a feeling you don't always associate with dept. stores.
