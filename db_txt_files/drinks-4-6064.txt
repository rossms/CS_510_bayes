Ahhhh...good ol' Mug Root Beer. Now this is something that I hardly ever drink but actually really like I just never seem to think of ordering it. I think it's because it's not something you can drink a whole lot of because it's kinda sweet. I'm sure there is nothing good for you in this, just tons of sugar and preservatives but it's still one of my favorites.
