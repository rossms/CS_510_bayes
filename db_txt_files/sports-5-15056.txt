To those of you that are judging OJ. you were not there. This murder trial is not between us and the courts but rather between OJ and God. if he was guilty he still has to meet his maker .if he was innocent than who are we to judge him. I dont know if he is or isnt guillty ,but I dont think he would have killed her with the kids there. I think he would have done it when they were at his house.
