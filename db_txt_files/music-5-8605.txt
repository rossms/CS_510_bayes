it is difficult for me to be copmlitely objective because I adore Ricky Martin. The first time I saw him on TV was three years ago and I remember myself wondering how on earth could I have missed him for such a long time. I like everything he does and hardly waiting for him to appear on film. I think his latest video is great,it does not show him as a guy from any of those sweet Holywood style videos - B.Spears,etc. It has more artistic touch and great music. I have no doubts it will do very well on world's music charts.
