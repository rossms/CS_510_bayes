i want everyone to understand something. cars are made for some people in particular. no one likes everything, so if you are in a market for a car of your dreams, just follow your heart, all man made items breakdown, so if you are expecting to buy something that would never give you problems, you are kidding yourself--that said..the boxster is a wonderful car and you have to either love it or hate it, which ever is your choice who cares...we love our car and when we feel its time to let go, we do that!!!!!!!if you have a boxster, you have a great german car!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!enjoy it
