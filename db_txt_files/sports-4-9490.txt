DiMona, what are you smoking. If you are a Sixers fan, you have to be an Eric Snow fan. Why do you think he is one of the three untradeable players on the Sixers? How many point guards would be able to play next to AI knowing they will get 5-8 shots a game to his 30? Have you noticed who ALWAYS takes the other team's best offensive player? You have met Hundreds of guys in the gym who are better than E. Snow? my ass. You clearly do not PLAY basketball, or would understand that lots of people can shoot, but only few can play.
