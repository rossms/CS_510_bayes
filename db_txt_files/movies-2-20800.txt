Stricktly by-the-numbers block buster movie making. It was well made and lively, and the cast were very attractively decked out. But none of it was memorable or original, just capably presented. I was impressed that they didn't drop in dubbed singing by better singers, and thought Richard Gere's Rudy Vallee-ish warbling around with his extremely limited voice was the best part of the film. And of Course John C. Reily never disappoints.
