One of the world's great cities! Recognized by the U.N. as the most multi-cultural city in the world and it has the restaurants to prove it. Plus international bookstores, cinemas, clothing stores, etc. etc. A clean, safe city that still manages to be exciting. Big-league sports, great theatre, vibrant music scene, shopping, museums, a new opera under construction ... even the architecture is getting more interesting.
