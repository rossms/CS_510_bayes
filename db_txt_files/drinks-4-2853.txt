this is the best instant coffee I've drank. I really don't care much for instant and all instant coffee doesn't taste like reg. But maxwell house instant is the best instant and it doesn't taste sour like folgers instant. I kinda liek the taste because it is sweeter and more thicker and richer. I hate how instant tastes funny. oh well I don't buy instant as much as reg.
