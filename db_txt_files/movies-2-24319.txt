Don't do it... I fell victim to 'well, maybe the third one will be better than I heard the second one was'. The dinosaurs were pretty cool, I have to admit that, but wincing from the scary dinosaurs was not as bad as wincing at the pathetic plot and cheesy lines that came out of the characters' traps. I was sucked in because a buddy of mine wanted to go and see this, now he owes me one bad movie that I realy want to go and see. Please do not add fuel to the fire of a 4th edition ot this series.
