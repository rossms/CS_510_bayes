One of my favorite states. Something for everyone. Beautiful beaches, mountains, desert, flat plains, it's all here. From large cities with culture, diversity, sports, the arts, fantastic shopping and great restaurants, to small, quaint, interesting towns, it's all here. One of the few states with every type of terrain. One of the most diverse populations in the United States. 5 stars and deservingly so.
