Had my first four last night at a birthday party. I enjoyed every one of them and do not regret the minor headache that I now have as a souvenir. They are light and sweet, making them a good pre-dinner choice in mixed company. I drank them from martini glasses (standard?) and did not feel like a sissy. I said to the host, Hey, these things go down smoothly. He assured me that they would sneak up on me. They did but I can attest that I have been snuck up on by far worse. My suggestion: Find a designated driver and try a few!
