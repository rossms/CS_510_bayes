I may be referred to as eccentric at times, and I am hardly rich, as well as I am several years away from being able to join the red-hatted Ladies Society. I do like their clothes. They may seem a bit pricey, but you pay for good quality clothing. I have items that I purchased from them several years ago that still look great. I love their washable linen shirts and their unique one of a kind items. I do not own any muumuus either. A bit of lagniappe, Christian missionaries who were shocked by the clothing, or lack of, that the Hawaiian women wore, designed the muumuu.
