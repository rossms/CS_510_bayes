Honey Bunches of Oats (with almonds, mind you) is a very very good cereal. Probably my favorite kind of cereal. But I don't really like cereal in the first place. It's true that it gets soggy really quickly and then it's kind of gross, but overall, it is the best cereal that I've tasted! So you should all eat it . . . . EAT IT!!
