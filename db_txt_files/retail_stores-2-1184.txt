I haven't worn Bugle Boy clothes since I was a little kid. Anyway, I just took a look at their website and their clothes don't seem all that different from the crap that Abercrombie Fitch sells. It's true that Bugle Boy clothes look like stuff for 12 year old boys... but then so does most of the stuff in A F's men's line. Infact, I'm starting to think that's what's in style for young men these days. Dressing like you're in junior high. I really don't understand these comments here... or rather, I don't understand why there aren't similar comments for other clothing stores.
