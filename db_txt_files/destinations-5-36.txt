I was the Head of English and Economics at GSS Kaura Namoda between 1975 and 1977 whilst serving with VSO. The town was very welcoming, divided into the old and new parts, with a wonderful Friday market that attracted villagers and visitors from miles around. Places of interest in the town were local dye pits, pyramids of sacked ground nuts and a large freshwater lake.
