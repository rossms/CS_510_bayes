Sometimes I think that I could throw for 350 yards and 4 touchdowns in that offense, but that shouldn't diminish what he has done over the last two years. And this year, he has been absolutely unstoppable. He seems to make the correct reads on every play, picking out the right receiver, and hitting him in stride. He is on pace to shatter every single season QB passing record. Short of putting 13 players on defense, I don't know how he can be stopped.
