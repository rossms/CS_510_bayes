They've been my fav. NFL team since dumping the lowly San Diego Chargers in 1996 (I should have dumped them years ago). Definitely playoff contenders again, this year, I imagine. Trent Green has played as I expected him to. And Priest Holmes and their star tight end (I forget his name -Gonzalez?) have been stellar. I expect a 9-7 season this year and a wild card playoff seeding.
