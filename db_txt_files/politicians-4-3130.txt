ONE OF THE BETTER RECENT U. S. PRESIDENTS. HE DID A GOOD JOB AS PRESIDENT. HE PASSED THE WELFARE PROGRAM, WHICH FORCED MORE LAZY AMERICANS TO GET JOBS TO SUPPORT THEMSELVES. HE WAS LSO TOUGH ON CRIME. IT IS BAD LEADERS LIKE BUSH WHO GIVE AMERICA A BAD NAME. THE ONLY CON OF CLINTON IS THE MONICA LEWINSKY SCANDAL.
