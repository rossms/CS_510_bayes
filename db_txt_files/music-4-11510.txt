This was the last album made before the lead singer died of an overdose. It is their best and most advanced album. It is a really fun album with really catchy songs. Their lyrics seem a bit more advanced than on their last album. One of my favorite songs is October 19, 1991 , which describe his experience in the LA Riots.
