We bought a used Pontiac Montana (98 model) two years ago and absolutely love it!!! It has all the bells and whistles that we wanted in a mini-van, gets great gas mileage and has a smooth and quite ride. The only problems we have been having are with some of the warning lights, but nothing too horrible. We kind of expected it with American made vehicles. Otherwise, it is great!!
