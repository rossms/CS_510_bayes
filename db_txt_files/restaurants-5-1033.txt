Boston Market is the best place to get a good, satisfying meal at a cheap price. The food tastes just like home cooked food, but you can get it a lot faster there than if you made it at home; that's the beauty of fast food. Good food, fast, and Boston Market is no exception to the rule. The rotisserie chicken is the best, the meat it soft and very tasty. The sandwiches there are also great. The sides are the best; have the creamed spinach or the macaroni and cheese, that's excellent there. Just like mom makes it, only better (sorry Mom!!!!).
