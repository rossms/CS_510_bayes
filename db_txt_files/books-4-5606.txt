This book sucked me in and deprived me of sleep on many late nights. I agree with magellan, the ending was frustrating, but the rest of the book was captivating and enchantingly written. It was a perfect mixture of history and romance, not too heavy on either one, and left me with a lingering sense of romantic tragedy.
