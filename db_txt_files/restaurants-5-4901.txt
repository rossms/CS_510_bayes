I work for Ruby's and I really like the food that we serve. In defense, service is completely different from food quality. There are some servers I work with that I would gag if they were waiting on me. I like the food although there are some itmes I would never eat, and I truly enjoy working for this company. It really is a great place to eat, a great place to work and a great investment
