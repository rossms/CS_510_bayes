Easily the best full flavor cigarette I have ever, or likely will ever smoke. These things are packed tight with some of the most expertly blended tobacco you will ever find. They have a smooth draw, intense but not abrasive flavor and a nice finish with zero aftertaste. Gauloises also burn at about half the rate of American cigs, so the enjoyment lasts longer. Most places are having these at a 2-1 special right now, so check them out, you won't find any better.
