The nicest part about this zoo was the incredible gorilla exibit other than that it was awful. The lion was in a cement cage with a steel barrel for entertainment, the walking pahts were unkept, and the overall quality was incredibly poor. I am a North Texas native and would never recomend the Dallas Zoo on the other hand the Fort Worth Zoo is incredible and award winning. Go there if you are in the area.
