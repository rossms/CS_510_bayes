* The comment about JJ being cocky is surprising to me, because when people who know him (old people, not just his peers) talk about him, they always say how humble he is. I don't know, but that's what without fail, everyone's told me*...I've never met JJ, but know several folks who have, and they say that besides being a great player, he's a great guy.
