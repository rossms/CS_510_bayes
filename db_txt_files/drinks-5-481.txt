Hoegaarden is a fine, fine beer. It seems like every other hip microbrewery out there has their own variation on the summer brew theme, but Hoegaarden is the ultimate summer-Saturday-afternoon, just-finished-mowing-the-lawn, need-something-refreshing kind of beer. Of course, this stuff is good any day of the year, but try this with an orange or lemon slice on a sweltering July afternoon and you'll know what I mean. Fans of Blue Moon Belgian White should give Hoegaarden a try and experience the real thing.
