I can't believe how cheap Denny's is. They give you a buttload of food for practically NOTHING... I ordered a sandwich once but it was pretty gross... if you mess up a sandwich then the rest of your food can't be too good. They have awesome brownies though... Definitely be sure to split one with a friend!
