Just goes to show how two people can see a movie and have two polar opposite opinions of it. I thought this was one of the scariest movies I have ever seen. If you like slasher movies, this is not for you. The fear is in the suspense. The theatre that I was in was filled with people screaming at the appropriate moments and quiet at others; a sign of involvement. No oscar worthy performances, but every one of the characters is believable. I'd recommend this film to anyone looking for an intelligent, suspenseful, thought-provoking movie.
