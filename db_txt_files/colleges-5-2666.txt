Stetson Univeristy is a great school. It has small class sizes and professors who want to see their students succeed in the classroom as well as in their careers. The only major problem Stetson has is residental life. Their dorms are old and in desperate need of renovation. While several dorms have been updated, there is still much work to be done. Overall, I'd give the education emphasis of Steton 5 stars while the non-academic areas could use some work.
