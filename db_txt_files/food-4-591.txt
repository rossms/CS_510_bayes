When I was younger, I liked this cereal because my mom let me put sugar on it. This was a big deal considering I only got Lucky Charms and Cocoa Puffs when I slept over at friends' houses. At about 12, I'd eat the stuff with 1/2 a cup of sugar in each bowl. I couldn't do that now, but it was sure good then. One time I even got so desperate for my sugar-drenched cereal that I ate it without the cereal, just the sugar and the milk. I would rate it five stars because of the bond I developed with this cereal, but I don't think it was the cereal so much as the sugar.
