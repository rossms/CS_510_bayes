Released in 1973, Band On The Run remains Paul McCartney's best work after the demise of the Beatles. This full-length effort contains two of McCartney/Wing's most popular singles, namely Band On The Run and Jet, and also includes the minor hit Helen Wheels as well as Wing's best song that does not get any airplay, Nineteen Hundred and Eighty Five. This latter track is difficult to find and is not on any of McCartney's compilations as far as I am aware.
