I think it is so sweet that Hillary Clinton is spending Thanksgiving with our soldiers this year. This is one wonderful lady. I have so much respect for her. If she ever decides to run for president, I am behind her 100 percent! We love you Hillary ! Thank you for going to visit our soldiers. They need all of us so bad right now.
