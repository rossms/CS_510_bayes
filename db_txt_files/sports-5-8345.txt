Since Tim Duncan is my favorite player, I think that he is awesome. I have been following him since Wake Forest. I just love they way that he leaves the crowd guessing. You never know what he is thinking and he doesn't humiliate himself in front of his fans. I would do anything to meet Tim and if he ever reads this, Tim I am probabley not your biggest fan but I'm so close it's scarey. Have a great rest of the season and I hope that you keep getting stronger.
