Time Warner cable is pretty bad. I used to have a different cable company that was very good and then Time Warner took over. Where I am located, I can't get another cable company because Time Warner somehow monopolized the town where I from. Time Warner not only has problems with their broadcasting system, they show the same old movies/programs over and over again. The reason why I give it two stars is because I no longer watch that much T.V. and I lost 15lbs because of them. I'm no longer a couch potato. Thanks Time Warner!
