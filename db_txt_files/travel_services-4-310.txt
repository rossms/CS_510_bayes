I found the experience a blessing. I booked my flight with a window and an aisle and when I checked in they didn't have any window/aisles left. I complained a bit but not that much. What I liked most is for their mistake they upgraded me a tad the attendant said. Little did I know that she upgraded me to Business class. YIPPEEE! Great flight to Britain and very comfortable. I would definately fly with them again.
