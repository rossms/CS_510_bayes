The Lakers are a team I love to hate. I'm almost ashamed to say it but I enjoy rooting against them more than I like rooting FOR certain teams I like. They underachieve and they talk a lot. I don't understand how Coach Jackson lets them get away with the garbage basketball they've played so far this season (w/out shaq).
