I've been twice and have been amazed at how bad it is. The musical number they do? Even if I could tolerate the noise, the waitstaff isn't allowed to do their jobs while it's going on. But I think the low point there was having awful snow crab. It's called Joe's Crab Shack, and they can't make crabs? They were stringy and dry and wouldn't come out of the shell.
