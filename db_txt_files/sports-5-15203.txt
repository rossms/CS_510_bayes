This guy is great, he plays for the San Diego Chargers and looks like a lightning bolt on the field he has it all.He's a downhill runner that cannmake you miss and can catch Drew Brees passes.He keeps defenses up all night watching film just to figure out how to stop him when they pretty much can't.
