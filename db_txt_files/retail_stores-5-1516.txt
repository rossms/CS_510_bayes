I think Lord Taylor is an excellent department store. The selection of merchandise is very good, and you can count on it to be high quality. I'm always impressed by the customer service at Lord Taylor, and I think that's one area in which the store really outshines its competitors. I can always find a knowledgeable (and even pleasant!) salesclerk when I need one. If given a choice, I would choose shopping at Lord Taylor over any of the other major department stores.
