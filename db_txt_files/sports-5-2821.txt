Year in and year out, he does more with less than any other manager. They have one of the best records in baseball this year and, yet, only a hardcore baseball fan can name more than six players. And, these players love to play for him. I can't believe that he isn't under contract for next year. As one of the top managers in the game, Baker will be everyone's choice if the Giants don't lock him up.
