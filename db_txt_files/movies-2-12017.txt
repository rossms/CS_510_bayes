For an Adam Sandler comedy, it was ok. It did not contain the greatest of jokes like the Waterboy, Happy Gilmore, or Billy Madison. What makes this a bad movie though is the time length. The movie is only 75minutes long. It felt like I had just stepped into the theater and then walked out. The time length is also bad because the plot was rushed from beginning to end. I hope this doesn't mean that Sandler is losing it.
