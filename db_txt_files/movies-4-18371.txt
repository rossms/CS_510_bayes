There were a lot of possibilities in this film that weren't explored. There were some elements that didn't quite take off with full effect: the comic attempt was a little weak and the dialogue was simple. With all of these defects I managed to enjoy the film. I loved the special effects and remained wide eyed throughout. Good story line but it lacked intrigue.
