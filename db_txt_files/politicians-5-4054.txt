Dianne Feinstein is a fantasic woman and a great legislator. She was elected to the Senate by a larger majority than any other female in history, and serves on numerous committees that have to deal with foreign relations and fighting terrorism. She is a leading advocate of finding a cure for Breast Cancer, and fought hard for the passage of the 1994 Crime Bill which banned the manufacturing of certain assault weapons. She also protected nearly 7 million of California's lands in her environmental package. I admire her for being more centric on the issues than some of her colleagues. She's a great woman!
