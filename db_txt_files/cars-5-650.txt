The FLT series Harley Davidson, the classic. They do exactly what they are designed to do. They look great, and sound great. They handle better than their japanese counterparts. A little underpowered, but a bagger is not supposed to be a rocketship anyways. Japanese rice riders try to imitate biker nostalgia. A biker is not an "enthusiast". Many japanese are beginning to realize this, and are buying harleys like hotcakes. Todd will always suck.
