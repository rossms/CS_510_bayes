I was born in the small hospital just behind this attraction...I must say it is placed in a very strange place, obscuring the view of the Houses of Parliament as seen from the Festival Hall. I would have put it in front of the Tate Gallery or somewhere near Battersea Park, but it is a fine monument and sums up modern London - no, not going round in circles...!
