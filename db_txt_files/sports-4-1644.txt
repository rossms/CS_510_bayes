I'll be rooting for the Pale Hose and Houston to make it to the Series. Why the ChiSox have not been to the Series since I was born. Had the Black Sox known it would take this long to win one, maybe they wouldn't have thrown the 1919 World Series. Do you think Cubs' fans know where Comiskey Park is? [I'll give you a hint, just sing the first line to "Bad, Bad Leroy Brown"]
