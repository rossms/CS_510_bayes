A truly beautiful city, so much to do and see, incredibly Beautiful year round and somewhat like living in a giant air condition room your whole life. If you like the occasional "weather" go somewhere else. One of the most ergonomic areas too, every type of store and resturant is a short drive away... hands down best mexican food in the country, but could use more Indian and southeast Asian. What other place in the world can you play in a 3+ feet of snow winter wonderland in the mountian forest, then drive down and enjoy 65f+ winter weather when you've had enough?
