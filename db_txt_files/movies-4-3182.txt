My comment is only involving the role of Omar Al Sharif - i think it made a Good Impression in terms of describing the arabs and the way they think coz the previous movies are actually describing the arabs as valgures and mostly idiots - the arabic language was clear unlike the other movies when they actually using some sort of a weird accent and it has nothing to do with the arabic language - the acting was good again not perfect though ..
