When I rate an actress, I rate them primarily for their acting ability. That being said, Julia Roberts is a good actress- attesting to her performances in 'Pretty Woman' and 'Erin Brockovich'. But what she has to realize is that no one cares about what she thinks politically. Roberts is paid to act- plain and simple. But she deserves 4 stars based on her acting ability (she can still get even better with time).
