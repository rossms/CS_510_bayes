Like most Twentieth Century Literature, it is strongly based on immoral themes. Takes place in 1960's Czechoslovakia. Is well-written and will appeal to a progressive crowd. I don't find that anyone is any better of a person for having read classics like this and Lolita, though one might find them entertaining.
