I've really enjoyed everything I seen that has been directed by Moore, (Roger and Me and The Big One). Both films are sort of in your face documentaries where he puts himself into the line of fire so to speak by actually confronting the people he's criticizing (sp?). To top it off he pretty funny while he does it even when sometimes you start to feel uncomfortable for the people he's ripping on.
