After spending a year isolated on the DMZ in Korea, I returned to America wanting only one brand of beer: Samuel Adams. Anything else- including some of the higher rated beers on here, like Sierra Nevada or Tecate- tastes like rat piss to me. Red Hook Hoptoberfest, Casco Bay Pilsner, and Casco Bay Riptide Red are the only other beers that can really compete, and they are all New England microbrews, difficult for other parts of the US to obtain.
