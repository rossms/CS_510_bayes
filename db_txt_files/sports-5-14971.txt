Jack was a fearsome player. One of the most fearsome I've ever witnessed as a spectator. He had outstanding speed to help cover the pass, but this linebacker relished the chance to fill the gap , and literally crush passers, running backs, and receivers. His outstanding play helped solidify the STEEL CURTAIN , and earn 4 superbowl rings!
