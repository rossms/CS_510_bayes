Up until I saw The Geena Davis Show, I really liked Geena Davis. She was great as the quirky dog trainer in The Accidental Tourist, and I loved her in Thelma Louise. But after watching her for 15 minutes in her new show, I lost all respect. Not only was her acting terrible, but she was playing a sleazy, obnoxious character, too. Either she sold out, or she doesn't mind assuming that kind of role. I'm hoping that she'll come to her senses and return to the old Geena Davis I enjoyed so much.
