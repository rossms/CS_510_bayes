I smoke Marlboro Lights 100's, and I am not a menthol smoker; however, these are the best menthol cigarettes I have ever tried. They are extremely smooth and not harsh on your lungs. If I were going to switch to Menthols, this would be my brand of choice. The flavor is great too. If you like menthols (but not harsh ones like Newports or Kools), you should try these.
