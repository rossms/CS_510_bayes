LOL I just came across this site and I figured my home state would be rated low.Agreed there is not much to do for the tourist. But if anyone has been here it is probably the most wholesome,decent place you will find anywhere in the world. A great place to raise kids. Surveys annually rate Iowa's schools the best in the country, the lowest crime rates in the country, lowest poverty rates. Go to any small town and you will find the most decent friendliest people in the country. Iowa also produces 10% of the countrys food for all the people who think food comes from a supermarket.
