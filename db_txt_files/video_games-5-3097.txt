i would like to see games like this more often. its alot of fun to go around beating people up in a game. volt kruegar is a badass. i never really liked sion the main character. he was a horrible atempt at making a badass. my favorite character is mugetsu becuase hes a crazy guy and his fighting style is awesome. i hope to see a sequal some day.
