Wasn't that bad. Far better than some of the CGI crap they have been peddlin' out like Shark Fail and Oy, Robots. Stripes is half Babe and half Rocky. A nice story of a zebra who goes on to compete against racehorses. Maybe it wasn't the funniest animated flick out there (the flies needed to be swatted), but the story of the father (a former horse trainer who quit after a tragedy) and daughter (she wants to be a jockey) and what ensues is compelling.
