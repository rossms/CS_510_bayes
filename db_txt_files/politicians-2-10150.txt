I rated him bad (2 stars). Terrible is what I would use to describe the people who actually VOTE for someone like Bush. I refuse, however, to believe these make up 50% of the US population, who would vote for a guy just because he's freaking stubborn and never admits a mistake to himself thanks to some mental disorder caused by (high) society. For them that makes a STRONG LEADER. That's why they would vote in a heartbeat for Arnold Schwarzenegger as President, or Adolf Hitler for that matter.
