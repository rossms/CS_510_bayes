Probably the most beautiful city I have even been to (with the possible exception of Venice, IT and San Francisco, USA). You can not help but be taken into this city's charm - everything is old, and beautiful, and tasteful. Unlike well-scrubbed London, Paris can be dirty and run down, but amazingly, this only adds to its artistic charm. Even the much vaunted rudeness of the French towards American tourists seems to add to the experience. Simply a gorgeous place, with incredible food to boot.
