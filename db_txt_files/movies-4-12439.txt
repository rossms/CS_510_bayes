I'd been told this movie was actually a pleasant surprise so I went and saw it. During the first ten minutes I became convinced I had made the cheesiest movie pick of the year. But I hunkered down and ended up being very pleasantly surprised and entertained. A good movie with fun and history and heroes. I agree that it falls somewhere between three and four stars but I'll err on the side of four because it's rare to get such fun live action family fare these days.
