I found this movie very disturbing and unusual. One minute it seems like you know what will happen next, but you find out your'e wrong. The ending is very surprising. Bette Davis and Joan Crawford are fascinating, and prove they still had what it takes to tell a good story. This movie should be watched, and please leave your thoughts about it here.
