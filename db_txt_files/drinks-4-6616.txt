A good drink.It haas a good taste but hardly anything new.What the hell is so bad about a Berry drink?!? Just cuz it doesn't taste like cola doesn't mean its bad.Its just like a Gatorade drink but caronated.I like it,the only bad thing about it is the aftertase which sticks to your mouth in the beginning but it will be gone if you drink more sips of it.A good I recommend it to anyone.
