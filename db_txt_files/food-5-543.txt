Ever since I was a little kid I loved Lucky Charms. Every chance I get I buy at least two boxes from the store, especially when Safeway has a buy one, get one free. My brother got me started on Lucky Charms. I like the marshmellow taste with every bite and also when you're done with the cereal the milk afterwards. To me I think Lucky Charms are pretty good... the only problem is the high ass price they be charging sometimes.
