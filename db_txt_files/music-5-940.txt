In an album format that very few artists will attempt today (rock opera), Dream Theater does a remarkable job at creating a masterpiece. This album is a sequel or a more in depth story of the song Metroplois: The Sleeper and the Miracle from the album Images and Words. A great story witha great surprise ending that fits the storyline well. As they have been for most of their careers, the musicianship on this album is top knotch. Various song time lengths and styles are molded together to create a pretty much flawless piece of music. Truly, DT were ahead of the times when they made this album.
