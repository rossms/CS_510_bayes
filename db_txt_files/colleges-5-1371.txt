How many UVA alums does it take to screw in a lightbulb? Ten, one to screw it in and nine to boast why they were better at it than anyone else. How many VA Tech alums does it take to screw in a lightbulb? Ten, one to screw it in and 9 to bemoan why they couldn't do it as well as the UVA alums. I'll say this about The University, no other alums speak with such deep reverence for their alma mater as wahoos do. There has to be a reason.
