Scream is a good movire because it's a parody of horror movies. The movie is able to laugh at itself. It's cool how the audience does not know who the killer is until the very end. It was also the first teen horror flick in the 90's, so the plot is original. The only thing that is never explained is why the killer killed about six people when he only wanted to kill Sydney.
