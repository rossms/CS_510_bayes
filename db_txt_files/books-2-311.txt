UPDATE: sixty7a, wait, which one would be the author? ORIGINAL COMMENT 9/14/04: Guys, I tried. I really did. I was in my comfortable chair. Classical music playing softly. An entire bottle of cabernet sauvignon. Air-sickness bag at the ready. I cracked open the book, got through eleven pages. Haven't touched it since. It sits in my living room like it's radioactive.
