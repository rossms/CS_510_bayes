William has got to be the best looking royal in the history of the monarchy. I really hope things go well for him and that he turns out to be a better adjusted man than his father seems to be. There are times I almost feel sorry for the life these people are forced to live. It would be like being born with a life sentence - guilded prison - but prison none-the-less.
