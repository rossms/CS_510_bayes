Plain? PLAIN?! Are the people who are calling these cookies plain the same people who rave over animal crackers?! They have a wonderful sugar-cookie taste (except with less sugar). They're called vanilla wafers, for yes, they do have a subtle vanilla taste. The texture is perfect--crunchy outside, chewy inside! These could very well be the ultimate store-bought cookie!
