this movie was a really good introduction for the characters...it was basically for the people who havent read or seen any xmen comics or cartoons...it was really well made..the only problem i thot was cyclops was given too small a role...but the effects were good..n wolverine was totally awesome..magneto n mystique were cool too..the ending was just amazingggg
