It used to be that this game was seen as a magnet for backstabbers and con artists. Players would have to constantly worry about getting stifed, and it's association with the days of the wild west probably did not help. But the reputation of the game seems to have changed. Now we have the World Poker Tour on the Travel Channel, and the World Series of Poker on ESPN. It has become alot more respected now. My grandfather tought me how to play, and every time I pick up a deck of cards, I think of him.
