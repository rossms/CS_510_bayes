To be honest, I was a little biased against this game considering it was made by Microsoft, but if you're into Sim type games, this is pretty good. They have a very diverse selection of animals, terrain, flora, even little shops, and with the addition of their two add=-ons (one that enables dinosaurs, another that allows you to build a marine park), it can be a lot of fun. It's hard to keep those little simulated people happy, but otherwise, it's alright.
