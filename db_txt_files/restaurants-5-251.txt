No doubt about it, this is the perfect fast-food burger. I've seen In-n-Out locations in both the Bay Area and L.A. that are right next to McDonald's locations, and witnessed an interesting phenomenon around lunch - the In-n-Out is packed while the McDonald's is empty. That says it all right there, doesn't it?
