Gatorade is the undisputed kind of sports drinks. There is actually nothing better than pounding a 32oz orange gatorade after exerting yourself, when you are hung over, or when you are just a little thirsty. It goes down quickly, unlike juice, and gives you a little more replenishment than water does. What I can't understand is how in the past 10 years there hasn't been one worthy competitor to Gatorade - All Sport and Powerade are awful - I would rather drink a Pepsi.
