 Sister Act is a surprisingly entertaining movie. I don't usually like Whoopi Goldberg, but she's great in her role as a nightclub singer who goes undercover as a nun. The show is fast-paced, and there are some pretty funny scenes in the convent when Goldberg's character is adjusting to her new lifestyle. Clashing with her is Mother Superior played by the hilarious Maggie Smith. Even if you're not a fan of Goldberg, Sister Act is worth checking out.
