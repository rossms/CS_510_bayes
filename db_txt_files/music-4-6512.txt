The new rage doesn't disappoint. The album starts out strong as hell, with the first four tracks being awesome, but it does kind of slip a little afterwards. Still, Zack's lyrics are awesome as usual, and while The Battle of Los Angeles may not suprass rage's classic first album, i'd rank it a notch above Evil Empire. Recommended.
