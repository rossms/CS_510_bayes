BEAR DOWN, CHICAGO BEARS, PUT UP A FIGHT WITH A MIGHT SE FEARLESSLY. WE'LL NEVER FORGET THE WAY YOU THRILLED THE NATION WITH YOUR T-FORMATION! My favorite football team. The only place the greatest running back of all time, #34, WALTER PAYTON ever played. It's not easy being a Bears fan these days. Except for one great run about 20 years ago, this team has failed to be inspiring.
