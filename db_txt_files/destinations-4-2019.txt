It depends where you go in Malaysia, really. The suburban markets in Malaysia can smell foul, the suburban shops are dirty and the gutters are filled metres deep with rubbish but when you go into Kuala Lumpur CBD, the area is squeaky clean and the air actually smells nice, not to mention that the buildings are almost glistening. The weather is not that great but I can't help but like this country.
