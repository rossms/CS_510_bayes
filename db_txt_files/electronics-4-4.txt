The Belkin TuneCast is definitely a cool little gadget. You plug it into your iPod, put your iPod near an FM tuner (car, receiver, etc.) and presto, you're streaming your iTune music through the speakers. Couple of problems with this thing though - it's battery operated with no way to charge the batteries. Second - driving around in cities can interfere with the transmission. But overall, not a bad way to spend $35.
