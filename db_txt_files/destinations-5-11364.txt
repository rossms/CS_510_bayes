You have to see it to believe it. It is impossible for photography or video to capture the vastness of this canyon, it's amazing colors, and the abrubtness of its drop. After seeing the Grand Canyon for the first time, it's easy to see why this place has an almost spiritual impact on people. If you haven't made the trip yet, try and get there soon.
