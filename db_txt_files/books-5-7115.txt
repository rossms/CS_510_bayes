I read 2/3 of this book at a fishing camp in northern Maine when I was in seventh grade. I forgot the title, but the story stayed with me. A few years ago I was trying to describe it to a friend, who turned out to be a fan, and he lent me a copy. It stayed with me for a reason -- it's a weird book, more about cultural history and the meaning of being human than technology or science. Good stuff.
