our family likes to eat here on occasion. Good food. It is a little more than our budget can afford so we usually go for lunch. They have some good dishes. I have tried the tacos {chicken and beef} both were good. the enchiladas are good as well. I like the fact that every table gets a basket of chips and salsa to munch on while waiting for our meal. I also like the fact that the pops are refills. The dishes are fairly generous in what you get. except of course a lot of the platter consists of spanish rice and beans. along with the entree. A good restaurant for the most part.
