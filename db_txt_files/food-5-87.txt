I love quaker oatmeal, and for many reasons. I buy the huge tubes of oats that cost about five dollars, and they last me forever!! This oatmeal is very healthy and can gain added flavor by adding maple syrup or fruit perserves (my favorite!). I also like to add the yellow raisins that are a little more tart. Basically any fruit will add just the right touch. So in addition to being cheap and healthy, quaker oatmeal also tastes good (with the right additions). This is also a great meal because it will keep you full for hours. This classic is defintely a great choice for any meal!
