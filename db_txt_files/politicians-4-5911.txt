A brave man who has the guts to stand up to the Bush regime and fight against the immoral, illegal Iraq War. One of the few politicians nowadays that cares about the U.S. Constitution. His past is just that: his past. He has disavowed the mistakes he has made...pity some people will hold that against him forever and refuse to see the good he has done.
