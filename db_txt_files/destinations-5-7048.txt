One of the loveliest cities...a mediaeval fantasmagora of canals, lace, chocolate, animated squares, horse-drawn carriages, swans, little courtyards...bliss. Go in the summer when you can have salad, moules and frites under the watch of the Begijnhof...winter is wet and the place is practically shut.
