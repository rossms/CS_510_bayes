The Land of Enchantment: Beautiful desert scenery, even on the interstate. I think the most beautiful stretch of intsrstate I know of is I-40 (?) going from NM into AZ (towards Flagstaff). Watch out for cops on both sides of Albuquerque, especially coming in from the east. The best TACO BELL in the world is in one of the towns about 50 miles or so east of ALB. (Moriarity, NM)clean, generous, delicious (authentic Mexicans making American Mexican fast food -- the best).
