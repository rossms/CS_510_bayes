A cute enough movie. Hayley Mills did a nice job playing twins who were separated as babies and meet at summer camp. They decide to switch places and get a chance to meet the other parent. Of course now the parents have to unswitch them. They have to get together now and the twins try and find a way to get the parents back together again. The movie is kind of dated from the early sixties. And it IS predictable. But a pretty good Disney movie.Nice movie for the kids.
