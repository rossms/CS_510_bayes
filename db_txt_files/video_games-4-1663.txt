I haven't done too many of these, they are largely unfinished in the puzzle book that I have. But the few that I've done have been rewarding. One must implement logic, and an undestanding of correlation when deciphering these things. They were also used by the military to protect top secret info in almost all the major wars, even today, to a lesser degree, as Computer technology has since rendered them somewhat obsolete in this regard. But their value as an learning/entertainment tool has stood the test of time.
