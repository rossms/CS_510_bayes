Ive lived right outside of San Diego for more than 13 years. I came from the southeast and lived in the northeast before then. Ive traveled through many major cities and San Diego (mostly because of the constant pleasant whether and abundant recreation, not to mention beautiful people) is in the top 2 or 3. Southern California is, in my opinion, the best place to live in the US.
