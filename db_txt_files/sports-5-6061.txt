One of the lasting impacts of the 2005 tourney will be the evolution of Pittsnogle from just a player on WVU, to an accepted way to express yourself. As a verb - you've been Pittsnogled - as an adjective - it was a Pittsnoglian weekend of basketball, and off course as just an exclamation - Pittsnogle!. It's a great story, the only native West Virginian on the team, and he had a lights out tournament.
