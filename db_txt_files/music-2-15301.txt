Moby and Techno electronica music, are a joke. I'd much rather listen to the spirituals and folk tunes that made up PLay rather than Moby's jacked up, car commercial versions of the songs. He's not a genius, and he's not very talented, except with computers. I prefered Moby much more when he tried to be punk that one time. At least he was trying to make music, as opposed to sampled beats. the only good thing about Moby and his last disc Play, is that the mainstream LOVED it...which means that moby and his new celebrity gloryfing junk disc are passe and will be gone. Bring on REAL rock and roll!!
