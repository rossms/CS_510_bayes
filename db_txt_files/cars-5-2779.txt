An excellent car in almost any incarnation. I have had a 94 Celica ST coupe for over 3 years now and I couldnt be happier. It is reliable, it accelerates and corners well. All and all I think this is one of the best looking, most reliable cars ever made. At 120K miles I have had no more than the usual preventative maintainance done on this car.
