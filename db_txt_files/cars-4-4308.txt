Old Quest's are horrid. The 2003+ version is recommended by me. Features alone on this car are awesome. The whole roof can be a moonroof. Stow anway third row AND second row. Reliability for the new model is unknown, although the old model was bad. That's why the Oddysey and Sienna are dominating the Jap minivan market.
