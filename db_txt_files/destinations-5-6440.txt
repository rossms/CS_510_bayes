Definitely a diamond in the rough! Nice people and some of the best food this side of the Atlantic. Charleston is of course a gem, Columbia is a great (underrated) capital/university town, and Greenville is a vibrant business center near the mountains. And the best part: no big-city hassles like in neighboring states. A good place to visit or call home.
