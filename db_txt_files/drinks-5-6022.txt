I found this to be an excellent drink for large meals. It helps me digest my food better than other drinks and doesn't stay in my throat like heavy cola's. I've got acid reflux and take aciphex. This helps calm things a bit. Also, I found it takes about 3-6 drinks/servings/bottles to acquire a taste. Don't judge it on the first bottle.
