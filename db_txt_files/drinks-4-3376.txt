I'm not someone who likes to drink a lot of beer when I go out and I find that Hard Cider is a great alternative. It's light, tastey and has just as much alcohol as beer. My favorite by far is Woodchuck Dark and Dry but if that's not available (and it often isn't) I'll drink Cider Jack. Cider Jack has a good overall flavor but seems to lack the crisp and very distinctive taste that Woodchuck has. In a blind taste test you could easily tell the difference it's that obvious.
