Grant Hill has totally impressed me. He is an outstanding leader for the magic and is a good scorer, averaging about 20 ppg(points per game). But the thing that has impressed me most is the way he has battled back from all of his ankle surgeries, truly remarkable, not to mention averaging 20 points a year after surgery.
