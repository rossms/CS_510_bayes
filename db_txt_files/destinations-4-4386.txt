I like Ft. Lauderdale. It feels much more like a Florida city than Miami. Ft. Lauderdale is a mid-sized city that is growing and offers the elements of a city without being too overwhelming. It's long past it's Spring Break reputation and is now a more well-rounded city with a good social life and with beaches that are easily accesible. It's a nice place to escape to during the winter without getting into all that is Miami. Miami is right down I-95 if you're interested. Ft. Lauderdale is also a cheaper airport hub to fly to and from. Check out Jet Blue if you're going there.
