It is true...he broke his oath of office, but still...with jack ass Bush running the US I wish we could elect him again. You will probably learn to appreciate the man after 4 years under Bush. Is it coincidental that there was Bush (Gulf) and war, Clinton and (eight year) peace and now once again Bush and war? Clinton acted as a great US president not only in Bosnia and Israel-Palestine area, but also for balanced budgets and decreased deficits. Think about it...
