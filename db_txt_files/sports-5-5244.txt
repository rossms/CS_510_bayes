I'm a Duke fan, although not really a Laettner fan, but we are rating his college career here, so to call the guy a loser is just inane. Four final fours, 2 NCAA championships, the top scorer in the history of the NCAA tournament, and if memory serves, was 10-10 FT and 10-10 FG in the big UK Game. He may be jerk, but he was one of the greatest college players of all time.
