This is what happens when great concepts fall flat. I was excpecting a great childrens comedy with a light hearted air about it and kid style action sequences in the tradition of The Great Muppet Capper. What I got was a warmed over plot line filled with tedious and boring side plots and very few likeable characters. I found it dull, dark and used up. The little puppies are really damn cute though.
