KHAAAAAAAAAAAN! Totally 80's above-average sci-fi. I love a hot-vulcan Kirstie Alley, the over-acting William Shatner, and the always-entertaining Ricardo Montalbon. Trust me, it is a complete exercise in over-acting. A total dreadful pleasure but still watchable sci-fi. . .And watching Spock get his ticket punched is kinda sad.
