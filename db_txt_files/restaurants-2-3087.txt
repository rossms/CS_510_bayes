I find Cold Stone Creamery a bit over the top and cheesy (for ice cream that is mediocre)...just take how they name their sizes - like it, love it and gotta have it The thing I find the most irritating is one of those original creations things that is called something like Germanchöklädekäke This word makes no sense whatsoever in German. As a fluent German speaker, I find this the worst attempt ever at making up a supposedly sophisticated, fake German name for something.
