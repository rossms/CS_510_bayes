This has got to be the most reliable car ever sold. Great gas mileage and a decent overall package. However, I do wonder about safety issues if you were involved in a wreck. Actually, I know someone who hit a horse an totaled their Corolla (1991), but they walked away just fine. The horse was O.K. too.
