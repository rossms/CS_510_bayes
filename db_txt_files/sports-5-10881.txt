Virginia Football fans know he has picked up the tourch from GW and is doing a wonderful job. Any rating lower than 4 stars are being given by VA. TECH and MD fans who are for some reason both scared and obsessed with the success of Al Groh. You know someone is successful by the amount of fear shown by the competition. I guess it really doesn't matter, UVA fans LOVE Al, the comments from other fans don't mean nothing. Their dislike is a measure of his success! So, in a way all those 1 stars given by the VT and MD fans on this board have the value of 5 stars.
