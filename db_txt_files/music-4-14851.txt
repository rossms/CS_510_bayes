I still blush wjen I listen to 'Darling Nikki'. Just kidding, I only blush to that song when I listen to it with my grandmother whose name is , strangely enough, Nikki... Super reocrd by the Purple Midget. The song 'Purple Rain' is one that you will always want to have a girlfriend or an ex-girlfriend or some female to resent, relnt, or reflect upon. Even if you are not a Prince fan, you should get this record.
