Susan Sarandon is an exceptionally good actress. She seems to have some range, as she went from playing in the woman power film Thelma and Louise , to the compelling thriller The Client , and most recently, Where the Heart Is and Stepmom . Stepmom is probably my favorite of her films. I am a Democrat, but I do not necessarily agree with some of her views, but I respect her exercising her right to free speech, and the many charity organizations in which she is afiliated with.
