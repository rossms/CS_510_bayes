Good lord people, Ed O'Neill is NOT Al Bundy he played Al Bundy for eleven seasons. I loved Ed O'Neill as Al Bundy but obviously some of you nitwits think he still is Al or want to forever typecast him. Ed O'Neill is one of the most versatille actors out there who can do both comedy and drama. Check out some of his films such as Dutch, Sibling Rivalry(an ok film), or The Bone Collector with Denzel Washington. He may not of had the success in film as say Tom Hanks, Tom Cruise, Harrison Ford or even Ed Harris, but he's still a very likeable and talented actor.
