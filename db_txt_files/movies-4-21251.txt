A good musical with Shirley Jones and Gordon MacCrae in the leads. this takes place around the time when Oklahoma is about to become a new state. This movie has it's usual good guys and bad guys. It also has some great songs.White Little Surrey with the Fringe on the top, Oh what a beautiful morning, and of course Oklahoma.there are some good dance sequences too. A pretty good movie for the most part.
