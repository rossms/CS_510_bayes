I used to buy this stuff all the time before the price of Tequila went through the roof after that drought. It used to be $23 per bottle. At $45 per 750mL bottle, it's too rich for my blood now. It was one of the few Tequila's availiable that was made with 100% agave. Had a great tequila flavour and wasn't harsh.
