Priest is an amazing player!!! Not only does he play well but he is smart too!!! GOOOO Priest we love ya!!!! It was an honor to have ya at our high school. I remember watching ya play and it was apparent you were destined for a career in the NFL. Keep up the kick ass job you are doing and be the leader and inspiration for the team. You rule Priest!!!
