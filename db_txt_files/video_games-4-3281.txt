Everyone at ign.com thinks that MGS is the best Playstation game. I have to disagree. It is a very good game with a good story and great dialogue, but it only takes around 10 hours to beat your first time through. After that, you can go through in as little as 6 hours without skipping dialogue. I do enjoy playing it, and it is fun, but don't expect an unbeliveably good game that is better than FF7.
