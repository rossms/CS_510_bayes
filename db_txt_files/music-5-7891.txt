Living on a Prayer is my very favorite video of all time. I am the biggest Bon Jovi fan and I love all of their videos, but this one captures what they are like live. The best! This video is an absolute classic. And I think it really shows how they interact as a band. They changed the way all videos have been ever since. Live videos cannot be done as well as Bon Jovi does them! Bon Jovi Rules!
