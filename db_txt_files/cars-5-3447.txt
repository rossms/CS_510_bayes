Owner of a 1997 RAV4 Just enough kick to make it fun to drive, the nimbleness of a car, the utility of an SUV without the abysmal gas mileage, not too big to be overwhelming to drive or a chore to park. A great little SUV! Power is a bit lacking and that's my only real gripe, but I'm looking forward to test driving a 2001 to find out if I want to step up to a newer model.
