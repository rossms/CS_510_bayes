Boy whose mother died has millions of pounds fall upon him (literally), and after telling older, more materialistic, brother they set about spending it before the nation goes euro. The characters are great fun and well-acted, including widowed dad and love interest, poor mormon missionaries, a bad guy after the money, and the saints who appear off and on to talk to the idealistic, dreamy boy.
