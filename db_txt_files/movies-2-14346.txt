Shoot me for saying this but I found nothing entertaining about this film at all. This is not the kind of film you watch if you've had a great day at work. Seeing such an amazingly talented actress like Ellen Burstyn dripping with sweat as she declines into a revolting drug habit and watching Jennifer Connelly perform a lewd sex act in front of a bunch of horny men was definitely not my idea of entertainment. Not something I would want in my DVD collection, it can stay on the shelf.
