The Red Hot Chilli Peppers new album rocks. I think this is a very good song because the melody of the guitar hits a person's mind and heart. Californication talks about all the problems stars and people face, especially in Hollywood. This is very true and I think people should be reminded that it is easy to get lost in all the hoopla and fame. I love Flea, the way the words resound through his voice and vocal cords like strings. It's the voice.
