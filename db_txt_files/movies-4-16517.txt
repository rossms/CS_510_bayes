Space Cowboys is a good space adventure with a great cast. All seems to be scientifically-accurate and there are some moments of good tounge-in-cheek humor injected at good points in the movie. The profanity is slightly excessive, but nothing too severe. THe special effects are also quite awesome. Overall, a good movie!
