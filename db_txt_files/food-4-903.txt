I loved these as a kid..Diggum' Smacks, right? Or wasn't that the tagline with the cool frog? They are kind of an odd shape, very sweet, very satisfying to the five year old in need of a sugar rush. However, this is a 3 bowl cereal ..you have to pour just a bit in with a little milk and eat them, and repeat until a full bowl has been eaten. If you go for the full bowl, full of milk, you will wind up with sloppy smack mush.
