I started eating Lean Cusines for my 3 meals each day and they have already helped me to lose weight in 2 weeks. Through the day I always eat a bag of baby carrots and some fruit plus I drink LOTS of water! Last night as I was getting into bed, my husband (who wouldn't notice if I changed my hair color!) said my tummy looked thinner and that I had shed at least 5 lbs. My favorite Lean Cuisine is the Turkey, gravy, stuffing, whipped potatoes, and green beans with cranberries. Only 280 calories and DELICIOUS!
