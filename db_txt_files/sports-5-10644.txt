For the first time since I can remember there is an excitement about Utah football that is feeding on itself. Urban is exceptional when it comes to preparation and intensity, but the way he actively campaigned last year to fill the seats and rally excitement has turned the stadium from a yawner on game day (I was there) to the hottest ticket in town. This guy is as good as they come- his confidence and motivation are suberb.
