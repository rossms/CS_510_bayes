I have a 2002 Liberty sport that has been ok until my engine light came on and my speedometer stopped working at 50k miles. The engine light is still on and the speeedometer still isn't working after replacing the transmission control module and speed sensor. I will never buy another domestic vehicle again. Ironically, this is happening after the warranty has expired. I am trading the jeep after the problem is corrected. This will be the most I have spent on repairs for the jeep than my 2 Hondas in 10 years. I do not recommend this vehicle.
