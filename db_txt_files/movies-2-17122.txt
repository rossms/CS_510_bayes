I don't know what it was about them, but from the moment I saw the protagonists on screen, I disliked them, and, consequently, couldn't care what happened to them. This is a poorly acted, emotionless, stiff piece of acting, and I'm glad they became shark bait and fish food. UPDATE: I just saw a review of this film where the reviewer said he would have liked anything interesting to happen, like Wilson from Castaway floating by. That cracked me up.
