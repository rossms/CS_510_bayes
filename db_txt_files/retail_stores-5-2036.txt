I love BB. I shopped around for the best prices on computer stuff, appliances, audio stuff, ect. BB is either the cheapest or second cheapest. . .I am a loyal customer because I returned a crashed computer and they returned it in time and without charge. Don't get suckered by their extended rebates. . . If you go back and wave a reciept they will take care of you. Lines are long but this is something I don't really mind. Staff isn't very knowledgeable but I don't look for clerks to be smart anyway. . .Until I have a bad experience, I will shop here.
