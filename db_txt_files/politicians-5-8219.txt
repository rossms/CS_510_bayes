JFK was a kick ass prez! Not only did he advert nuclear disaster but he had an affair with Marilyn Monroe In the history books all the pictures for the president were happy looking ones but JFK's was one of him with crossed arms looking at the ground. His assasination was a tragedy to our nation and if he would have remained in office the U.S. Would be a diffrent and better country
