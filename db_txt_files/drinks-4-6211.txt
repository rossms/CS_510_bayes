It definately has alot more vanilla than the Coke Vanilla has ! At first I didn't care for it, but after advice, I bought a can of diet Van Pepsi and regular Van Pepsi. And it is totally true ! You can't even tell it is diet ! I enjoyed it more than the regular Van Pepsi. I was truly shocked ! I highly recommend the diet Vanilla Pepsi to pepsi drinkers and even coke drinkers.
