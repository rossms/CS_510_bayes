I don't know what it's like down in the states but in Canada Harvey's is pretty good. The burgers have substance, not juts patty shaped goo like McD's. The fries are still okay but they used to have the fresh cut, Swiss Chalet style fries and they'd give you a huge bucket full, not the eight french fries McD's tries to dress up in those eternally stupid fry containers.
