Though I have not tried any of the competitors to TurboTax, I cannot imagine how they can be any better for basic to intermediate tax returns. The program is rather intuitive, has some of the more rare and complicated forms, and allows for a wizard type interface for entering data or the user can just enter information directly on the forms. However, no tax software, even TurboTax can replace professional advice for more complicated tax situations and planning.
