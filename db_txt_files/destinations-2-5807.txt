I ve spent a lot of time in this state and I m truly kind of tired of it. The beaches are nice but the backcountry is just shabby and hot. Way too many transient temporary life-styles, poor medical care and a raunchy educational system. Like anywhere else, if you have bucks you can live well. I just wouldn t want to deal with the really hot summer weather or the chance of hurricanes blowing me away each and every year.
