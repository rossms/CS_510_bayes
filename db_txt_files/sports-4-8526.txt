Kobe is a great athlete, but I still think he is overrated. I am tired of comparing him to Michael Jordan... there will never be another MJ. Kobe is good, he did not rape that girl, but I hate his attitude. He is the reason Shaq was traded, and the reason of Phil Jackson not being there....but thats cool with me , I'm a Kings fan.
