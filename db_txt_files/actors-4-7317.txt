Man is this guy hot! I can't seem to find anything wrong with his face, or his body. lol. On to his acting. He did an awesome job in X-men as Cyclops, and played a very sexy bad guy in Gossip . I'll also give him credit for Disturbing Behavior . Can't get enough of him. I wish I could see him in more movies... Oh, and he certaintly doesn't look 28...
