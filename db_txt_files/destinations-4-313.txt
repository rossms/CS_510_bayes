This town was a real relief for me. After Darwin and Alice Springs it was a thrill to see the good food in the restaurants. One square mile and about 600 restaurants. Adelaide is into good eats. The Barossa valley is nearby; good winery tours. Quite a variety of things to do. I even found a pistol range right downtown where you could rent guns. I stayed here 5 weeks.
