He's made five films, so let's look at each one: Clerks - great, Mallrats - enjoyable but not all that good, Chasing Amy - great, Dogma - absolutely f*#@ing terrible, Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back - great. There seems to be a pattern here, every other film of his I enjoy. This means that his next one (Jersey Girl) is most likely going to completely suck. We'll just wait and see (my money's on the suck end of the spectrum, especially since J-Lo is in it)
