This film is pretty amazing. Didn't quite know what to make of it at first. Started laughing my head off when I saw it on telly - thought it was a really bad horror film. But then I realised that all the blood, muck and detachable hands were meant to be funny, and laughed even more. Scary enough to hide behind the sofa, funny enough to wet the chair. This was brilliant.
