Salt Lake is an eye appealing city, but beside skiing, there wasn't much to do there. We actually stumbled upon one of the very very few bars in downtown Salt Lake, and had a great time there. But residents of Salt Lake don't take to outsiders well...at least that's the impression I got. Went there once and probably won't go again...
