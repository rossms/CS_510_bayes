Tampa is the best...Ybor city is awsome for nightlife...kind of like a cross between New Orleans and Charleston, SC. Once you get past all the industrialized areas, like Dale Mabry, it's a very nice city. The weather here is warm all year long, but not insufferably humid. There is so much to do here with Ybor City, Channelside, and St. Pete and Clearwater beach nearby. University of South Florida is nice, but UNIVERSITY OF TAMPA is even better, and an architextural masterpiece in itself...
