I hear that the movie is really bad compared to the book. I haven't read the book but I thought the movie was worthwhile. Penn, Bacon, and Robbins all do a great job. The acting is superb, although the story wasn't very good I thought. Lots of people liked it and I did too for the most part. It was just a bit odd.
