Best soft ice cream in the business. The original vanilla/chocolate twist; though don't try to get it at a DQ in the Dairy State (Wisconsin)...where they only serve vanilla (LAME - I guess that's why James Lofton had such problems in Green Bay). Chocoholics should try a Blizzard with chocolate DQ, M M's and the choclate dip sauce (no NOT THE HOT FUDGE). Heaven!
