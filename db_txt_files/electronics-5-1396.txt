I have had two of these, they are great! Its a great idea, and it always blows peoples mind when they ask why you have headphones hooked up to a casset. Then you get to show them all the great things it can do. I'd give it 6 stars if i could, the only down side is that they are kinda expensive, but they have a lot of utility.
