The Greek mainland is so great and is (sadly) rarely visited by most tourists. Mount Olympus is beautiful and offers great hiking. Monemvassia is a great Byzantine port town that doesn't allow motorized vehicles of any kind. Delphi has amazing ruins and is fun at night. The coasts offer super views of the sea. I'd give Greece a 5, even WITHOUT Athens and the islands! Athens is a great, underappreciated city and the islands are pristine and gorgeous. Crete is one of the most interesting places I've ever been.
