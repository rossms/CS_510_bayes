The best college cornerback ever (and proving to be an All Pro in the NFL as well). His leaping, one handed interception grab against Michigan State was the most impressive pick-off I've ever seen. People can make the arguement that Peyton Manning should have won the Heisman, but it was Woodsen (on offense, defense, and Special Teams) that lead his team to the National Championship.
