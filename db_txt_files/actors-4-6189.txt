Very good European actor. He's talented and you can see it in his roles, he's believeable. He should stick to specific roles, picking and choosing which ones he wants to do. I think there are some roles he cant play, but some that he would excel in, like dark, moody, atmospheric movies that are edgy. Would be great in stories with a twist ending like The Usual Suspects as well.
