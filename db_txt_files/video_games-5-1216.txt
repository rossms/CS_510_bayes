It was so difficult finding someone who would play fast-paced card games with me like Spoons and Speed, because Spoons requires at least 3 people for it to be fun, and Speed is something I've found only a few people like. Egyptian Rat Race, however, is fantastic! It can be slow--or fast [my favorite]--and there are so many variations, but it's so much fun. It's pretty much the only card game besides Hearts the people at my school will play when our AP classes have finished testing, lol.
