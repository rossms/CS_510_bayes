It was pretty good. Takes place 2 years after the first one ended, and Borne (played by Matt Damon) is still tortured by the past he can't quite remember . . . and for good reason (after all, you're not really paranoid if they're really out to get you, right?). Nice car chase scene (not quite as cool as the first one, but pretty good). Good follow-up to the first movie.
