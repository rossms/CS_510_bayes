I've owned a used 2002 Ford Escape XLS with Automatic and V6 Engine for six months. Although the transmission is a little 'quirky', and the interior fit and finish is pretty basic, with a lot of plastic; overall I like the vehicle. It is quieter than I expected, and the engine runs smooth. No braking problems, as others have suggested. The biggest plus for this small SUV is the towing capacity. I have a 2500 pound boat that the car handles easily. No other small SUV in its class even comes close to the Ford Escape for towing capacity. I would buy another - and that's the best recommendation I can give.
