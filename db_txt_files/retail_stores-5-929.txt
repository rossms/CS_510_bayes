I love the clothes at A&F!! If you think A&F is expensive, go shop at Gadzooks where a cheap quality polo shirt is $44.00! Or go to The Buckle! Their hoodies are $72.00! Yes, I like A&F. Not because I want to be in, but because I like the style of their clothes. Is that a sin? Abercrombie shoppers are not all insecure and shallow people! Like another reviewer, I am also the same person I was before I started shopping there. And let me tell you, I have never had any of their clothes shrink on me or fall apart!
