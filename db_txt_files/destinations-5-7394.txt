I had the great fortune of touring Paris with someone who was basically fluent in French. As a result, I had a completely different experience of the city compared to what would have happened had I tried to go it alone. People were friendly and courteous, we got good deals on great food, and the city was as most people who dream about Paris believe it to be.
