Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim... what a joke. You have a good team, why rename your franchise every 10 years? The last name change tells you that this is not a historic franchise. Can you imagine the great Chicago Cubs changing their name to Chicago Cubs of Rockford, or the San Francisco Giants changing their name to San Francisco Giants of San Jose. Not just embarrasing... funny.
