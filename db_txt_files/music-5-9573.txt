I loved this CD. My favorite songs are Private Emotion and LLVL. I quit going into music stores because it was so depressing, I'd think who are these people anyway and they call this music! Then one day I went in and heard LLVL, the clerk kept playing it over and over again. Didn't know who the artist was, so I finally went over and asked her. She showed me the single and I bought it on the spot. Then I had to wait almost a month for this CD to be released. Thank God there is still music out there for music lovers like me.
