For the person above who said that you go to UF if you have the grades...if I had awesome grades, I sure as hell would not go to University of Florida. That's why they made Ivy League schools. Get a life. FSU is a great university, all state curriculum is the same to me due to the fact that the facts of school subjects never change. Go to FSU if it is the school where you feel that you belong, and the same goes for UF.
