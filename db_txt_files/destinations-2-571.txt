I have lived in puerto rico for over two years.I have found that most people here are rude to non spanish speaking people. CRIME is a huge problem here.Most all streets need work and need the trush pick up.Puerto rico can not compare to Florida because most of the beaches in florida are clean.Puerto is a nice place to visit for no more than a week. IF you can AFFord here.
