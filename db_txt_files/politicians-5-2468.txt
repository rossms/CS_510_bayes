I believe that when looking at politicians that opinions should only be formed based on their record. I don't believe in being picky on how they got it done, just the fact that a good job was preformed. And clearly the whole record shows that Rudy Giuliani was a great mayor. In addition, outside of the record and purely from my own personal opinion I think that while the affair thing was nasty, overall I think he is a brave and good person.
