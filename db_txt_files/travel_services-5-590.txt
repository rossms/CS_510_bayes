I dont see how this airport cannot be liked by anyone. First of all, they have restaurants and shopping everywhere, they have a modern and clean location in a midst of a 3 billion dollar expansion. It is so big, and yet they have transportation to get you around. I would have to say for large airports (including international) msp is a great airport. They are among the top five ranks in overall customer satisfaction!
