I've been riding for 24 years - riden everything from @ 125 dirt bike to a Harley road king - in fact I own a road king (2003) and a gold wing - The HFD is a beautiful bike but fails in comparison to the Wing - The HD - only 2500 miles been in the shop 4 times - you guessed it - oil leaks. The Gold wing - never a problem - comfort- reliability, smooth ride, excellent handling - But I do have to admit - not a bike for someone who wants to tool around town locally. Enjoy your ride and always ride safe!
