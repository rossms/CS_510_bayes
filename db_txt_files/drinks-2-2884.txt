Sanka..No Thank ya. I'm pretty sure I've only had this coffee maybe once and I'm in no hurry to have it again. What's the deal with making coffee out of tiny coal like chunks the size of baby chicklets anyway? The funny thing is how popular these types of coffee's were 15-20 years ago. I remember seeing Sanka and other dried/powder coffee's at peoples houses all the time. It seems a miracle that there's still a market for them with the surge in brewed coffee.
