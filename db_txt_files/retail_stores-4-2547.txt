The closest thing to Bi-Lo in the bayou state. Most of the stores I have been to are clean (the exception being Jones Creek at George O'Neil). The prices as everyone that has posted has made reference to are a little high compared to other markets, but are not too expensive. The sales prices that Albertson's has really are good. Look at the number of items they always have at 10 for $10. That always seems to cancel out the higher priced items. In the Baton Rouge area this is by far the best stores remaining, since the demise of Delchamps and the now-on-life-support- Winn-Dixie.
