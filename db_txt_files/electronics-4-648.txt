These phones are basic, but work really well. They are very easy to use, and handle well in almost every situation. Mine has never malfunctioned to any great degree, and the software updates do not destroy your programmed numbers. Their battery life is somewhat less than ideal, but carefully maintaining your usage and having a car charge is good enough to take care of the problem.
