Oh my! Pistol Pete was an outstanding all around basketball player who had a weak supporting cast. His scoring records have lasted longer than Babe Ruth's home run mark. Plus, according to John Wooden, he was the greatest ballhandler in the history of basketball. 44.2 points a game and lead the SEC in assists. Not as dominate as Lew Alcindor or Bill Walton because he was a guard.
