Scary as hell. Halfway through the movie, I found myself holding on to the person next to me for dear life... For this reason, What Lies Beneath would make for the perfect date movie! As for Michelle Pfeiffer, her gaunt facial features worked perfectly for portraying someone who was possessed. Harrison Ford was looking aged but thats to be expected. The movie had an interesting plot, was well acted, and even had a few funny lines. Overall, I would definitely recommend this movie ...though its not for the weak hearted.
