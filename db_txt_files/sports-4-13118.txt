I'm giving UCONN 4 stars - although they may not be very good today in 2002, they are taking the right steps to be a great program in the near-future. They have a new stadium and facilities, a new coach and decent recriting, and most importantly they will finally be joining the Big EAST!! Now that great rivalry between Miami and UCONN in Basketball will carry over into football as well.
