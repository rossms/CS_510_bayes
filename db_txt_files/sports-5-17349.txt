Best record since 1999 (tied with the St. Louis Rams). McNair and Eddie George are great soft-spoken leaders and consistent performers. McNair plays hurt almost every game and George has not missed a start in his entire career. A very talented team with a great coach who you can expect to make noise in the playoffs year after year.
