For years friends had been telling me to pick up Jan Karon's Mitford series. But the thought of reading a book based on the adventures of a beloved small town minister didn't inspire me to run to the bookstore. I finally broke down and bought the first book after I overheard a woman express my same reservations - but she went on to say she was totally captivated after she started reading the book. And I was too. There's a certain charm to this series that makes it a very good read.
