This movie was HILARIOUS!!!Not only that,but I liked the subject matter;which was God!!!Hard to believe that Jim Carrey would play such a Godly role!!!Not exactly Jim Carrey-like!!!But funny as HELL!!!!Almost as good as "How The Grinch Stole Christmas"!!!I love it when Carrey stars in films that are VERY funny,and not just stupid!!!Examples:The Mask,The Grinch,Bruce Almighty,and Liar Liar.But his films such as:Ace Ventura,Dumb And Dumber,The Cable Guy,and Eternal Sunshine Of The Spotted Mind are more STUPID than funny!!!Anyway,Bruce Almighty ROCKS!!!
