THis is by far the best out of the whole entire Jason series, and I think I know why. The others were all set at this stupid camp site, that was totally ugly and unattractive, while this one is set on a cute little boat in beautiful Manhatten. We also get more of a plot, as Jason is now on steroids, and is a big muscleman dude.
