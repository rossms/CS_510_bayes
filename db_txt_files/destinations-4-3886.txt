 Despite the fact that I was mugged with a knife stuck in my neck I like Pittsburgh. As pointed out below there is a burgeoning arts scene and the skyline is nice. The last time I was there which was 6 years ago the Downtown did'nt really have any nightlife but that may have changed. I spent a lot of time in Monroeville where the University Of Pitt is. There was a great 24 hr Pizza-Sandwich place where all the College drunks would go with the riff raff hanging outside waiting to mug them. That's sort of what happened to me.
