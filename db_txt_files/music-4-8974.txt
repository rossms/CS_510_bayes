good video with a strong and clear messaage. I thought the video was kinda sad. the song is too. I liek the song. I only have listened to a couple of fuel's songs, but they are a good group. The vid was cool. some members of the group fuel are cute. the girl in the video did have a bad day and that was what the song was about. clear menaing and good example of what us chicks go through some days.
