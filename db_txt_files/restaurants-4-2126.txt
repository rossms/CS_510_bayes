I love Tim Hortons, the food is excellent and so are the drinks. I only have one complaint, and this doesn't go for all locations. The pricing for steeped tea and bag tea. Now apparently the price for steeped is .24cents more than bagged, but I continually get charges the higher amount for bagged. It doesn't make sense.
