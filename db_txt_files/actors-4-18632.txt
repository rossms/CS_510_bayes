I don't know much about directing, but I like Ron Howard very much as an person. Even though he's known success ever since he was a child, (an unsually good child actor, by the way) he is quite modest, and quick to give credit to others around him. He maintains a genuine affection for Andy Griffith, his TV father. And he doesn't have to go around wearing a pretentious toupee. He seems to be one of the most geuinely nice guys in Hollywood.
