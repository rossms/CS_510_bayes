Pretty well done movie about the life of Painter Frida Kahlo. Salma Hayek did a fine acting job. Follows her life from about 1922 to when she died in the 50s. She had some real tragedy in her life when she was in a horrble accident which caused permanent pain and surgery through her life.She married painter Diego Rivera. pretty intesting biography on her.
