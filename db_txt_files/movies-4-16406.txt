Good well acted movie. a young woman gets evicted from her home for failing to pay taxes. an Iranian famiy buys it with the intent of reselling it at a higher price. I like the way that the only bad guy is the policeman that hooks up with the young woman Kathy, they were sympathetic to the Kathy character and the Iranian family I fould myself rooting for all of them. the end is very sad and tragic.
