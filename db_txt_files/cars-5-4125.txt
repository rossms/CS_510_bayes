I love my Aztek! I bought a 2001 when they first came out and just traded it in today for a 2003 AWD Aztek. I can fit 4 adults, a baby in a car seat, a 100 lb dog and luggage with all being comfortable. It has power, great acceleration, great cargo room and great gas mileage for an SUV. It always turns heads and you just can't beat the price.
