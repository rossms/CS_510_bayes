My kids simply LOVE this book! What an excellent way to express to kids that it is OK to have an awful day and to feel bad or sad once in a while. A great way to introduce the wide world of emotions to little people in a humorous and entertaining way. An excellent book for all ages! We have all had those terrible, horrible, no good, very bad days!
