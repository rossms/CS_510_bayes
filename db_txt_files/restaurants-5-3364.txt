Still rates as the most fabulous pizza I've ever eaten at a dine-in chain. The smell was incredible (permeated everything in the room), and the cheese was so thick it was scary (almost DARED you to wade into it with both hands). Each slice was a good pound-and-a-half, loaded with pepperoni, onion, mushrooms, and green peppers. Piping hot and served quickly with a smile. Sadly, they moved out of this area, and a friend recently found one on a road trip and reported that they're NOTHING like they once were. Oh, well.....that memory (and the three pounds around my waist) will last a lifetime.
