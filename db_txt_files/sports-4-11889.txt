Marcus Allen certainly does not deserve one star as given out by the two previous idiots. Allen is a great College and Pro RB. Allen sr season at USC ended with a 2000+ season and a Heisman, however in the Fiesta Bowl against PENN STATE joepa's defense gangtackled Allen all day causing two lost fumbles one on his first carry. For the Game Allen carried 35 times for 85 yards.
