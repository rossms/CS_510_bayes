ok look, if u wanna compare a z to a ferrari get the hell off this site. the z32 is the fastest, best looking car you can buy for under $20 grand, PERIOD! sure supras look better and are faster but you're not gonna get one of those for under $20,000. if u're looking for a car that will turn heads, scream past all but a few domestic cars, is reliable and not gonna completely empty out your wallet, get a Z! i wanna hear what other cars look as good, handle as well and can do 0-60 in 5.5 s. lets hear it???
