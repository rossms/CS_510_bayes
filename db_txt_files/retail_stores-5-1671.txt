At first I gave Kmart a 3(ok), but I'm raising it to a 5(great). The reason is that now that I shop at Kmart alot now, I'm starting to see lower prices on things in their stores. That's a good thing. I know their prices can't be as low as Walmart's prices because of the fact that Walmart employees are not unionized and many other reasons. All retailers are feeling the blows from Walmart and Kmart should not be singled out for slightly higher prices. I enjoy shopping at the new improved Kmart and others should to.Go Kmart!!
