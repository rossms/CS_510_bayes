I just bought a 2002 YZ 125. This bike is mean! I am used to 80's, and 4-stroke 100's. What a power horse the 125 is! I haven't been so happy with a bike's perfomance in all of my years of riding! Beginners should beware! This bike needs to be run hard, so learning on it is tough, cause you'll have a tendency to foul plugs.
