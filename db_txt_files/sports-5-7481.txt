You're reasons for him being bad is becuase he trash talks! So what you're really saying is you're not aloud to have fun while you're playing! And what's this s**t about him not having a championship ring! Becuase he doesn't have a championship that means he's bad! Give me a break, sir charles is one of the greatist! P.S. all you people who think he has bad sportsmanship, have you ever herd M.J. talk it up? Or basically every great player that has ever existed? (well mabey not magic).
