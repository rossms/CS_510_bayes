Would this guy PLEASE go ahead and make the switch to the Democratic Party? Where to begin? First, I respect his war record. He's a patriot, no doubt. But his temper and poor attitude make me glad he didn't get too far with his presidential aspirations. And as for campaign finance reform--not so sure I think it's such a great idea. Seems to squelch free speech, if you ask me.
