First of all it's good because it's made by Sony. Sony makes all the best stuff. It makes Playstation which is the best video game system out there. Also Sony makes car radios, TV's, speakers, etc., so they know what they are doing. Now what's great about the Sony D Series is that it sounds great which is the most important part. It doesn't skip as much as the other CD players do.
