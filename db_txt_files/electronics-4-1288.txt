I have a Nomad Jukebox 2. It has great audio quality, storage (10 gig), and the menus and interfaces are pretty easy to use. The thing is bulky and heavy, battery life could be better, and there's a 2 gig limit on data file size. The main problem with it has nothing to do with the player, the software from Creative is crap. It is practically bullet proof, so it's great for things like snowboarding. Overall, I'm glad I got it. However it's a couple years old and newer players like the iPod and the Creative Zen series make it pretty much obsolete, fortunately it can be used as an external hard drive.
