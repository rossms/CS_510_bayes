interesting movie. Takes place right after the war. in a spooky mansion. A woman hires a staff to help with her kids and house. the staff must follow strict rules about keeping house closed up and locked and curtains drawn because of kids allergy to sunlight. Starts to get spooky when little girl claims to see ghosts, as movie goes on we find out more things about family and staff until surprise climax. pretty well done. and Nicole Kidman was good as the troubled mother. as CastleBee mentioned it managed to be good and scarey without resorting to blood and gore.
