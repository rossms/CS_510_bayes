Jalen has become one of the most dangerous offensive threats in the NBA. He can shoot the ball from the outside and can take his man off the dribble. As a lefty, he sometimes looks a little awkward, but he can generally get his shot off. Plus, his days as a point guard have served him well. He has good court vision and can handle the ball. Yet, there is something about Jalen that rubs me the wrong way. Often, it seems like he is more about Jalen than the team. After a loss during the Finals, he was quoted questioning offensive strategy. Jalen, how about keeping your mouth shut and playing the game.
