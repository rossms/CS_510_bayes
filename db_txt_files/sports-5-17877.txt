In my opinion, the most balanced team in the NFL. The Ravens have a killer defense - the rams a great offense. The Raiders are offense heavy, as are the Broncos. The Eagles have a superb defense and one outstanding offensive player. Only the Giants are able to put all the pieces together - and never has it been more obvious in their 41-0 destruction of the Vikings. Collins threw for 5 TDs and the defense smothered the high-powered Viking offense.
