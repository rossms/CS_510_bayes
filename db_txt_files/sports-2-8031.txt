If I wasn't a father with two impressionable sons I would probably agree with most of the other positive opinions about Iverson. But I am a father so I can't agree. Great player? Yes. Hustles? Yes. Plays hurt? Yes. Role model? Hell, no. Sorry folks, but appearances and words do reveal part of a person's character and I'm beyond blind worship of a professional athlete.
