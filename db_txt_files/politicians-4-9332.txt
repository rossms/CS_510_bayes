It's my understanding that there were two great things about Arthur: (1) when he became president, he surprised his cronies by running an honest and efficient administration; (2) not long before re-election, he realized he had a fatal disease and would not live long, but kept still about it and quietly decided not to run again. His grace and dignity surprised a lot of people, after having had a shady past.
