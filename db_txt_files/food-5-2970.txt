I've never been crazy about Oreos, even as a kid, but still I have to admit they're the King of the Cookies. Even as an adult I'll occasionally buy a little 4-Oreo package at gas stations when I'm on a road trip, and I still break them apart before I eat them (so I can get the non-icing half out of the way first, leaving an icing-overloaded half to enjoy slowly).
