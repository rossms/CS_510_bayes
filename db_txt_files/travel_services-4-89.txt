Joke-cracking flight attendants are the bomb!!! Maybe poor choice of words in today's world, but you know what I mean. If you will be flying only 2 hours or less to your destination, Southwest is definitely the way to go. They lost my luggage once, but they did eventually find it and return it to me. One other my flight landed in fog as thick as pea soup. But generally my dozen or so flights with Southwest have been pleasant.
