I for one like Cap,n Crunch. Our family has each own prefernce of which one. I like regular best, My kids like crunch berry. I like the sweet taste of it. It has been around since i can remember.We buy this cereal on occasion. Our rule with cereal is we only get what is on sale that week. so we have tried all kinds of cereal.Cap'n Crunch is one of the ones we buy willingly.
