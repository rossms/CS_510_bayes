I have been an avid Skoal Wintergreen Longcut man for the past 8 years. While currently deployed to Iraq, I asked my father to send me a couple logs. He sent me Longhorn instead because it was 1/3 the price. Took a can to get use to, but now I enjoy it. I will alternate between the two when I get back to the states.
