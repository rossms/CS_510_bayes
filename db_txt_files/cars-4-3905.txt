Have a 2000 Jimmy and like it in most respects. My only complaint is no place in the front seat for litter bag, box of tissues, large drinking cup (no, I don't like those that hang from the window sill). We chose not to get 4-wheel drive as we have not utilized it but three or four times in our 1994 SUV (another make) so I've enjoyed the fact that it is smaller, has 2-wheel drive--maneuvers and handles so very well! I'll keep it!
