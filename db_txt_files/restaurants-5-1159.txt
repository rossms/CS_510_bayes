Popeye's Chicken recipe is way better than KFC's recipe. Their chicken comes out all white meat with almost perfect and crisp texture and tender morsels of flavorful chicken. Their side dishes (biscuits, shrimp) also knock out KFC's limited choices. Every dish available in this restaurant is worth sinking your teeth into, and worth every buck in your pocket!
