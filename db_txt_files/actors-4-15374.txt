I agree with everything Flick01 says, except he forgot to mention one thing....her wonderful voice. Incidentally, did you know that she was always receiving bracelets & rings & things in the mail from boys across the country who adored her? She would send them back, thanking the senders but saying she couldn't keep their gifts. Then, she would get letters from the mothers of those same boys saying things like, You've got to keep this! You'll break my son's heart if you don't. HA HA - wouldn't we all love to have her charisma?
