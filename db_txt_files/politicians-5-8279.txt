It is interesting to note that although he was probably the most ardent supporter of Independence for the colonies, he successfully defended the British Soldiers accused in the Boston Massacre. Also successfully defended the leaders of the slave revolt aboard the Amistad. Not well liked in his time, he could be stern and unforgiving. Still, a brilliant statesmen.
