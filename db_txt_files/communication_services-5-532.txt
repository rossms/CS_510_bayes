I love Nextel, their customer service people are very nice, but they don't know anything, therefore it takes forever to get a question answered. The phones are very durable, my aunt accidently washed and dried hers and it still works, but dad has dropped his a billion times it still works, they hold up very well. Everyone I know that has one loves it. Minor problems are that the phones are on the larger side(bulky and heavy), and on most phones the connection between the phone and charger is horrible so sometimes it doesnt charge. But other than that I have never had any problems with them.
