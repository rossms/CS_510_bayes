I played this game religiously in high school... one of the teachers acted as a mentor for an informal gaming club. I have always loved it for the fact that there really is no element of chance. If you're not a shrewd negotiator (and a good bluffer!), you are a sitting duck! I recently purchased the CD-ROM version, and I'm looking forward to playing. Diplomacy's a classic!
