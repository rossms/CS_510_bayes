I am convinced that Hillary has lied to us too at times, but I think her motivations are much more honorable than Bill's or most other politicians. I think Hillary truly believes in her socialist ideals and although I disagree, I have a lot of respect for someone who has strong beliefs and consistently sticks up for them.
