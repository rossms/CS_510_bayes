Beautiful. Yes, Toyota DOES innovate! The Sequoia is a technological tour de force that puts the competition at Ford and Chevy to shame. Pop the Sequoia's hood and you'll find a sophisticated DOHC 32 valve engine as opposed to the Expedition and Suburban's comparatively ancient powerplants. The Sequoia is truly for the discerning SUV buyer who wants power, size and sophistication but without the yee-haw stigma attached to the domestic nameplates.
