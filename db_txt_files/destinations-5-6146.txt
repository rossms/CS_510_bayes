Beautiful place to visit. Grossly underrated. Land Between the Lakes is beautiful. And Frankfort (the state capital) has one of the best Vietnam Veterans Memorials. It's a huge sundial which sits on top of this small hill which overlooks the city. The names of all the veterans who died in the war are etched in granite beneath the sundial. The point of the sundial's shadow actually touches the veteran's name on the anniversary date of his death. It's a unique site and worth a visit to Frankfort just to see this. So many historical things to see in KY too. Consider this state as a vacation destination.
