Keira didn't really amaze me in that movie. As usual, she seemed too skinny for her own good. On the other hand, the guy who played Mr. Darcy kept my attention! (Woah baby!) The costumes didn't amaze me much except for the rich sister of the red head and the guy's costumes. I don't know why I have such a fascination for guy's costumes. I think it's just because that period fascinates me to no end.
