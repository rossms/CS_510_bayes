The worst of the Elm Street sequels, Freddy's Revenge has the same plot as the first film, except now there is a male protagonist. The acting is distinctively horrible in this outing, and none of the humor which made the franchise great is present. Awful. Skip directly to Dream Warriors, the very best of the sequels.
