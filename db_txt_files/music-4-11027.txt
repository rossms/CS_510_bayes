This cd is perfect for floating in the pool, gossiping and tanning with your best friend, trying to relieve the pain of a stressful life! It doesn't require you to listen to it as anything other than background music, unless you really want to. The Indian sound on songs like In My Pocket is really fun, and this is a pleasant change from much of the other teen-girl popstar music.
