I thought this movie was chilling. For awhile there it made me a little anxious to get on a plane, but that is what tells me that it was a good movie because it had an effect on me. The ending was a little boring and could have been a little more interesting because it just kind of ended bluntly. I would recommend a friend to see this movie.
