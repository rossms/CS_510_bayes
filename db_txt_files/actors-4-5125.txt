If you're going to mark the guy down simply for having taken the role of a gay character then you'd better go ahead and mark down people like Michael Caine, Matthew Broderick, Steve Buscemi, Jim Carrey, Russell Crowe, Tom Hanks, etc. etc. etc. It's a very long list. I think he's improved immensely as an actor over the years. Not just a teen hearthrob anymore but a pretty good actor.
