I DONT LIKE KFC "CHICKEN". THE PIECES OF WHITE OR DARK MEAT TASTE RUBBERY AND GREASY AS HELL. THE ONLY THINK I USED TO EAT FROM KFC WERE THE TWISTERS BUT THATS ALL BEEN SHOT TO HELL TOO. THE MASHED POTATOES TASTE KINDA FUNKY AND THE GRAVY LACKS FLAVOR OF ANY KIND. FIND ANOTHER CHICKEN SHACK TO EAT AT.
