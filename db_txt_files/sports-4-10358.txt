Tressel has had good success with Ohio State, and won a 1-AA national championship with Youngstown State before that. However, there has always been a lot of talk about NCAA violations at both schools, and I don't trust that he is doing things the right way. His schools might be proud that he wins games, but they better hope that he doesn't bring down more serious scandals than have already occurred.
