Only way to rate a truck is to have it over a period of time. Any truck less than a year or two old should have a good rating. My Dakota has been one reliable, well riding, do whatever I ask it truck. I can not recollect more than 2 non-maintenance problems that I experienced with it in almost 10 years of ownership and over 100,000 miles. I don't know how they are making them now, but Dodge made a great truck back when I bought it new.
