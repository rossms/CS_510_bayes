Where does this bad teeth thing come from? I think some of you are still living in the Victorian age or watch too much bad TV. We have Dentists now you know (sigh...) I am very proud to be British, although I am a tad upset at the way our Country seems to not be our own anymore. With a goverment that isn't worth the toss. However there's good things and bad things about England (same as anywhere) but one thing for sure is, there are alot worse places to be.
