First, There is a vast differance in performance between the Intrepid and the Intrepid ES. This should be clarified. The engine is larger in the ES and has more horsepower which really affects the performance. I drove both and bought the ES. Overall the ride is very smooth and quiet and it for a sedan it handles reasonably well in the snow. I am still baffled as to why ABS brakes are offered as an option. This is not new technology and it's importance has been proven. Shouldn't this be standard on all cars?
