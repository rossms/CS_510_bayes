I love Juan Pierre, I am a Mets fan and I wish we had him instead of that bum Mike Cameron. Juan Pierre to me is the best leadoff hitter in the game, even better than Ichiro. He doesn't strike out, he gets 200 hits a year, he hits for average, he can bunt, and he steals bases. He was the Co-MVP in the World Series in my book. He is one of the main reasons for the Florida Marlins success. He gets my vote!
