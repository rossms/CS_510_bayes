Most of you folks that are giving Keyshawn poor marks are bitter Bucs fans or are rating poorly because of his supposed bad attitude. Very few receivers have the hands that Keyshawn has and even fewer are willing to run crossing routes knowing full well they'll take a shot when they do so. If Keyshawn ends up with a different team which seems highly likely, he's going to come back and haunt Tampa
