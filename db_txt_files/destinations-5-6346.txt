I went down to Cincinnati once, and went to their airport, and it is the airport to visit! You could take a field trip there and have a good time. You could go there to shop, and get more stuff then you would find at your local shopping mall. It is like a mall there. They have a borders book store, a bunch of great restuarants, including a few intimate and fancy ones, and there are even some appliance stores there! Move over sears. It's a great view from the airport, and it's a beautiful series. I got a better look here, then I saw from the theme song credits on WKRP!
