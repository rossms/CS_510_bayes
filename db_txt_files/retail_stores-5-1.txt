The Tattered Cover is one of the most impressive independent bookstores in the country. It is absolutely huge and the staff is astonishingly knowledgable about books in every subject. They seem to always have what you want or need, and the prices are very reasonable. There's a reason this bookstore is rated so high - it's quite a bit like visiting Amazon if Amazon were a physical location. If you're going to Denver, this bookstore in and of itself makes for a good visit.
