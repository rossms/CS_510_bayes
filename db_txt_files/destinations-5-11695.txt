This is my stomping ground and of course because I live here, it is my favorite city in all of Florida. Contrary to popular belief, there is more to Orlando than Disney World....the locals are really nice people. And we are just like every other American. Our city keeps flourishing, and we keep moving with it. It really is a nice place to live. Great weather all year round, and there is less crime than most other metro areas in Florida. Our city is clean, too. And of course, I would say Orlando is probably one of the best tourist cities in America for the whole family. Kolby
