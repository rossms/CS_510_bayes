This is sad for me, because Angelina Jolie is one of my favorite actresses. However, this movie starts out taking her on a dangerous, and often disturbing journey where one bad thing happens after another. When it can't get worse...it does. And then the movie turns into something completely different. It makes a drastic switch from being about people who want to help those in other countries who are suffering, into a romance film that ends in tragedy. It leaves you very depressed and disappointed. Stay away if you're having a bad day.
