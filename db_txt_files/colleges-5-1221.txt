Despite its location in W Philly, the area is clean compared to other ghetto colleges I've been to. Plus, Penn is the only Ivy school where pretty chics actually exists. The students are friendly, as well as the staff. Small compact campus, and great high-rise dorms. No other Ivies can beat Penn's competition.
