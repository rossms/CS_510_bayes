Decent movie, but I thought it was much funnier than scary. I thought it was supposed to be a campy horror movie, not an actual horror movie. The acting is... Well... campy. I mean you have Marcy from Married... With Children and the guy from Herman's Head ... Not exactly a winning coupling. And personally, I find Chris Sarandon to just be a bad acting doppleganger of Michael Nouri... What made Mr. McDowell do this is as beyond me as this movie was of his talent.
