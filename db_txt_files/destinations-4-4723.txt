Having grown up in Detroit, and then moved to NYC, I can say that in terms of providing the amenities of a big city, Detroit is seriously lacking. However, the suburbs are excellent and affordable, the weather isn't as harsh as Chicago, and Detroit has an authenticity and grit I haven't seen anywhere else. Not to mention, Michigan has wonderful natural resources also hard to find elsewhere for the price. Its also a great sports town and has University of Michigan.
