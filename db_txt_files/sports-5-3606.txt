A fantastic baseball player, probably one of the five best of all time. He does NOT belong in the Hall of Fame however. Gambling on your own team within the confines of organized sports is the WORST thing anyone in control of those games could ever do. Forget John Rocker, forget Dennis rodman, forget Artest, LT, Cobb, Strawberry, Gooden, Bob Knight, or anyone else who acts like a jerk or does drugs, etc. Those things are ugly, but don't ruin the fabric of the games. GAMBLING DOES.
