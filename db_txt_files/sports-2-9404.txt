What an idiot! Not Artest, David Stern. This guy is going to be allowed to play in the NBA again. Great message to send, seeing as how he has a well documented history of taunting and fighting. Here are the new NBA rules: you can get away with almost anything (leaving the court and pummeling the face of a fan, choke your coach because you don't like his coaching style, hit a referee) as long as you're a good player. Only the NBA could manage to make a victim out of an idiot who throws a beer on a player.
