I visited San Francisco twice a number of years ago, and fell in love with the city; I only wished I could stay much longer to get to know the city properly. It was amazing to see the Golden Gate Bridge, Fisherman's Wharf, Telegraph Hill after years of seeing them on movies and television. Side trips to Muir Woods, Sausalito and the Monterey Peninsula only increased my interest in seeing more.
