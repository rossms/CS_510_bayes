Eleanor Rigby alone would almost justify Revolver's place on this list. It's a truly brilliant song. And while this isn't the Beatles strongest collection overall, there are several other very strong entries here. ExpressJeans and JenSecret seem to have a personal vendetta going on the Fab Four. I wish we could do a search by member and see what kind of stuff you two actually like!
