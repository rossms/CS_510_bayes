I was born and raised in Vancouver Island. I have also visited Vancouver many times(which was recently voted 3rd best city in the world to live in). Canada receives much negativity for its cold weather; however, Vancouver and Vancouver Island have the mildest temperatures compared to the rest of Canada. I remember when I was freezing my butt off in January in Edomonton(another great city despite the winter) and I desperately wanted to go back to Vancouver.
