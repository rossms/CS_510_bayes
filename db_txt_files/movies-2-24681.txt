This film adds a few more moves to the Kevin Bacon game, but that's about it. This movie has no chilling aspects, and does not properly convey fear. The film's premise is highly unbelievable, and the conditions under which some of the key plot developments are made are unbelievable as well. Bacon's character goes from being arrogant to being a psychotic homicidal maniac in one scene. After Bacon's psychosis is revealed to his supporting characters, the movie becomes a cheap slasher flick with a predictable and highly unrealistic ending.
