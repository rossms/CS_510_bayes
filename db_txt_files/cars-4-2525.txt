As a Soarer owner I must redress the balance of of the Swarz, get a REAL life, if you owned anF1 you would be too rich for your own good, great cars are things you can drive everyday, and that the majority can aspire to, not some sad overblown millioaires dildo replica, the Supra is a damn fine car, (not as good as my Soarer TT) and really is an affordable supercar, I have owned some of these so called supercars, and even with lots of money, you get 'p***-off' paying through the nose and getting 'tugged' by the 'filf' every 5 minutes, keep'em, give me stealth, get a Soarer!
