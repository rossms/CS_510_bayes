My grandmother partnered with Bill after Nada's passing. This is a place that a grew up in everyday. Downtown will never be the same. People who drive by that little corner will never feel the same. Bill and Nada's Cafe was a warm and welcome spot for everybody. You were always welcome. The mood and the crowd was always right and the people became your friends. It is now gone but the memory of this great place will never fade. Salt Lake will always be known for that little 24 hour diner on the corner. Bill and Max we will never forgett what you gave us and we never forgett you.
