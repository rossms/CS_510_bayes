A couple of more games, hopefully, and he will be the all-time leading rusher. He holds so many records and is high on the list of many others and because he plays for the Cowboys he gets very little respect. Well, history will vindicate him. League MVP, Super Bowl MVP. The first player to lead the league in rushing and go to the Super Bowl and win it the same year. He did it twice! Give the man his due.
