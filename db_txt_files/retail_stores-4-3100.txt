Whoever said that payless had as nearly as good a selection as famous footwear was mistaken. Famous Footwear actually has name brands, like vans, converse, skechers, and nike. Payless doesn't. I love famous footwear. It has good selection with sensible prices. I bought a pair of the converse lo tops that were only $20! This is a good shoe store.
