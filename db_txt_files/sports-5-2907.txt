All the records will fall someday, one to this insignificant guy, that to another. But nobody stirred the drink like the Babe. The Babe should be off this list, above it. Then you can start naming the best like Williams, Cobb, DiMaggio, Mantle, Bonds, Rose, Cy Young, Walter Johnson, Yaz, Aaron, Clemente, etc. After Ruth, it's pretty much up for grabs. Babe Ruth IS baseball. (Side note: After hearing Gehrig's comments on Lou Gehrig Day at Yankee Stadium, the day Lou was retiring, Ruth said later, I always thought I was the luckiest fella that ever slud safe into the 20th Century. )
