The actual phone service is fine - it is the billing and the customer service that keeps screwing us up. They have what seems like a helpful web site - full of lots of statistics, pretty graphs of your usage but NOT the ones I want to see - like am I going to go over my monthly plan this month? Plus we keep having to call them to redo whatever we set up online. I am convinced their site is ALWAYS fluky - customer service doesn't see what I see!!
