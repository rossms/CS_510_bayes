I bought a 1999, my first new car. from the begining the brakes squeaked. at first the dealer said, give it some milage, i took it back at least 3 times they told me nothing was wrong with it and that was normal. but they changed the brakes out anyway???? it didn't help. I would not recommend this car to anyone, who doesn't want to spend most of their life and money in car repair shops.
