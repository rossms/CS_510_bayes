I'm not a big Michael Jackson fan, but this is a great video. Probably deserved of the rating it received as #1 all-time by VH1. The transformation of Jackson into a werewolf makes it a mini horror movie and its duration is about 13 minutes. The dancing is wonderful, it is basically a flawless video.
