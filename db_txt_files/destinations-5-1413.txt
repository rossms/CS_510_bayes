Amazing history, architecture, culture. Must see places would include Eiffel Tower, the Louvre, Notre Dame , Palace at Versailles. Plus south Franch is beautiful. Maybe to see some winerys would be a good day trip. Paris subway is surprisingly clean and efficient compared to American subways(except for D.C. which is also good). Dont listen to the right wing hype. France is a great place to visit and people are not as unfriendly to Americans, at least they were not to us, as popular myth.
