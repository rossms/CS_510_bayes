I have a 1995 Ford Windstar. We have h ad nothing but problems. First, was the brakes, which make a thumping sound when applied. That has never been fixed. We've had the tie rods changed. Recently, we have had a blown head gasket, which Ford admits that they installed faulty head gaskets, however since we were 3,000 miles over our warranty they refused to pay for the repairs. Ugh, I will never buy another Ford and recommend to all my friends and acqaintances that they do likewise.
