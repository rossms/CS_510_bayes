I don't own it. But I've heard about it. I like how Eminem personalizes all his songs-introduces his life in depth to us- it's basically copyrighted like that. He's one of the rappers that- if you heard his voice on the radio, you'd know it was him. And what's special about this is that he included the guys who're the reason he's famous and junk. D12 I'd also like to note that I'm not an Eminem fan cuz he's a perv. I'm just tryin to be objective
