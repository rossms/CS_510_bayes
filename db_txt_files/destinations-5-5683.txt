I like Boston, but I have to disagree with Anonymous's comment that Massachussetts is great b/c it has the city of Boston . I'm sure Anonymous meant to credit the state's greatness to Cape Cod because we all know there really is no other vacation spot quite like it. The Cape combines the beauty/taste of the Hamptons (minus the superficial glamor) with the fun/variety of diversions good beach communities worldwide strive for. Wareham, REPRESENT; Welfleet, in da house. Boston? Where you at?
