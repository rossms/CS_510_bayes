Gable was a man's man and a woman's heart-throb. He could play comedy, adventure, romance, even slapstick. For those who've only seen Gone With the Wind , catch him in It Happened One Night, San Francisco, Mogambo, No Man of Her Own, or Mutiny on the Bounty. You'll see what a versatile actor he was.
