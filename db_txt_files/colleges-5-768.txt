I'm midway through a PhD in organization and management at Capella. To this point, the instructors have been engaged, providing significant feedback, and well qualified. My fellow learners are intelligent, hardworking, and have plenty of real-world experience to share. I am finding the experience very worthwhile and rigorous.
