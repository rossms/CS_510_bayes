BIGBABY, stop being a big baby. The MINI is light which allows it to still have top acceleration even with 115 measly horses. The MINI also simply has the best handling on the road. Parallel parking is a snap. And for 28 grand, a supercharged engine, leather interior, panaromic sunroof, racing gear, alloy wheels, xenon headlamps, GPS, speed sensitive wipers, the BEST sound system, AND enough space for four adults, not to mention already stated speed AND handling capabilities, the MINI is just plain frickin' fun to drive. Have you tried one? Let's Motor.
