I've always been a big Elisabeth Shue fan. She first captured my eye in The Karate Kid (I saw it for the first time the night before the PSATs and had trouble sleeping). And then in Cocktail, she looked absolutely incredible and I will always stop to check out this movie each time it is on because of her. In terms of acting ability, she really showed how good she was in Leaving Las Vegas with Nicholas Cage. She was tremendous.
