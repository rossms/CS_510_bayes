I've lived in abu dhabi all my life for 14 years and i am from scotland but i love it here. The city is great and the shops are getting better. the only letdown is the traffic as the taxidrivers can drive madly but the positive factors definetly weight out the negative ones. It's an increasingly popular tourist destination and well worth visiting
