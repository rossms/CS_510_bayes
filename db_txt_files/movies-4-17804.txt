Excellent film this. Intense and well made, when I first saw this I knew it was going to be good as soon as the opening credits started. Who else could play a loon so well than that of Jack Nicholson. Duvall does bug me a bit in this film - weak willed and screams alot. But hey a horror film would not be without at least one screaming woman.
