If there were 10 stars I would have given it that.I liked Linkin Park from hearing them on the radio and then I saw them on the Live 8 concert and was completely blown away at how awesome they were. Mike and Chester have such a chemistry when they sing/rap. I had no idea of the vocal abilities that Chester has and Mike Shinoda is a musical genius. They are the best band to come out in a long time.
