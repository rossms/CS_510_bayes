Newark airport is the best of the 3 major airports in the New York area. It is very modern and easy to navigate around. The tram connects all 3 terminals and the parking areas making it very easy to get from your car to your gate. The airport is also loaded with bars, restaurants and shops.. a little something for everyone. The only downside is that it is ussualy somewhat crowded and has more delays then average.
