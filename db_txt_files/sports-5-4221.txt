I went to grad school at George Washington before Jarvis was there. Basketball was more like an intramural sport played in a high school gym. Jarvis comes in and takes them to the Sweet 16. Now that he's gone, George Washington sucks again. Don't know what happened at St. John's, but he sure turned George Washington around.
