I owned a 2000 Audi S4. While this is a very fun and fine car I wanted something with more power and better handling and when I test drove my 94 Supra TT I new right away I had to have it. This car is rock solid. I sold the Audi and picked a Subaru for the New England winters. Needless to say I'm suffering from withdrawal because we're snowed in but that should make next spring even more exciting. Is it a true sports car or a GT? Who cares...I say it's awesome!!
