Seriously underrated, the Saturn--in my eyes, at least--easily surpasses the Playstation and in conjunction with Nintendo's masterful N64, should have put Sony out of the video game business forever. Sega's franchises shine on this console--with two great Sonic installments, including the classic racer Sonic R. Daytona USA, Virtua Fighter, and other greats also get their debut here. With a creatively-designed controller that is easy to use and a cool Genesis-like look, the Saturn is a bargain video game purchase I'd recommend!
