Kobe has the potential to be better than any human being ever to set foot on a basketball court. (yes even Mike) and for this reason he could be considered to be the best, but because of his selfishness and attitude he has ruined his aura. But honestly when a man can score over fourty whenever he feels like you have to give him some respect. As far as the NBA goes today, you have three guys who give it all to be the best, only one of them being a team player. Those three guys are Kevin Garnett, Lebron James, and Kobe. KG should be regarded as the best of them after their respective careers have ended.
