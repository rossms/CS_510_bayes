If you are looking for a college to attend I suggest you look elsewhere. If you must remain in-state U of Tenn. is probably the better choice. The city of Memphis has an increasing minority population and crime rate. U of M is right in the middle of it. I have been at the University for many years and I have seen the quality of both staff and students drop considerably. Of course you could do worse, but I am sure there are many colleges that offer better programs and environments than the U of M.
