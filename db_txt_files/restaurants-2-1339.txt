I have a daughter who currently works at Schlotzky's. Even she complains about how expensive they are. I would call them a major rip-off! Have to say the food is good but not that good. Also the portions are a down right crime for the money you pay!! Only recommend to people who have alot of money to blow and are not very hungry!!
