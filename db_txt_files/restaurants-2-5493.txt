When I was in college this was sadly one of the few places to go out to eat. Well what can I say it was a small town and this was actually in the town next door,... which was larger! Sure there were a couple of other places but eventually you'd end up at the 'rosa. I mean you've got to figure in a town with so few restaurants to begin with do you think any of them would be any good? Answer here is no. Well Ponderosa certainly wasn't good food but hey I was in college and it was cheap and you could stuff yourself. Have I been there since? No, no I haven't.
