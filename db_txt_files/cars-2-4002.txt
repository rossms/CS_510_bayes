GM is once again playing catch up. The VUE is a (very) late entry onto the crowded SUV market. There's already the Honda CR-V, Toyota RAV-4, Suzuki Vitara, Jeep Liberty and Ford Escape. That doesn't even include the larger SUVs like the Ford Expedition, Jeep Grand Cherokee, Toyota Seqouia and Nissan Pathfinder. There's nothing really special about the VUE to attract the buying public's attention, except perhaps for it's odd name. This thing looks like a Tonka truck. The Toyota RAV-4 by the way looks far better than this POS.
