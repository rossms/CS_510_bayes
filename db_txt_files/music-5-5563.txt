One of the rare finds in music where an album is complete and always enjoying from the very first note to the very last second. Every track from 'Hell's Bells' to 'Rock N' Roll Ain't Noise Pollution' is a masterpiece of good ol' rock n' roll in it's simplest form. Nothing bad can be said about this album. GO GET IT! NOW!
