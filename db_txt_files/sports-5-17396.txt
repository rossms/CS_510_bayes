T.O needs to get his act together, he's starting to look like a child with the ranting and raving on the sidelines. Make some freaking plays and stop getting stomped by lackluster cb's. Garrison (sp.) is the bomb he needs to be the featured back and used more as a reciver out of tyhe backfield along with beasely. The defense is strong but needs some addittional strength in the interior to take some of the pressure off the linebacking core. Carter and Peterson are the two top defensive players around, screw ray lewis. Give us an offensive line w/ some cohesiveness and we'll dominate, hands down.....
