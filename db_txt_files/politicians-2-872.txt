Ahh... I go to McGill so I had to deal with the Canadian's whole phoney election this year. Honestly I dunno why they're all so wacko liberal up there but it's kinda scary. Why can't they just go ahead and elect a true leader like Stockwell Day? Remember when Canada had a real leader... Brian Mulrooney.
