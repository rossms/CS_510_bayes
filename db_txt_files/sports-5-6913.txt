Completely unstoppable in his day. There were very few men with his size and talent and opponents did not know how to guard him. One year averaged 50 points and over 25 rebounds. Unbelievable stats by today's standards. If he played today however, he would still be great but his statistics would be more comparable to Shaq. *to correct 2 other comments, Jamison, Iverson, and Kobe have never scored even close to 100 points in a game. Also, Wilt has won 2 nba championships.
