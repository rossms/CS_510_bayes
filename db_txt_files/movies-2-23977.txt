I never understood why this movie had such a die hard group of fans. Was it because it embraced the notion so thoroughly that seventies fashion and hedonism would be the way to go until Judgement? I'd like to think that it was an inspired, forethinking genius who created wrote this with the hope that he would create the movie referred to more time for obscure, pop culture refernece than any other movie ever.
