He is very good with his body control and scoring in the paint over larger defenders....He has a very good jumping ability. He only gets a 4 from me though because he makes bad decisions occasionally, shoots poorly from the line, and isn't the best defender. He also isn't a great 3 point shooter. He is a nice person though.
