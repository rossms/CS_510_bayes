Bought an engagement ring their and had a good experience. Also went back to purchase my wife and I's wedding bands, but had some problems with the credit company they use. We never received our first statement, and after we did not pay on time, they revoked the 1 year of no financing deal. I was also charged for credit insurance which I did not knowingly sign up for. Overall I was impressed by their store during the buying experience, but was slightly annoyed at how they handled their credit situation. I would shop there again, but I am now leery of using their credit company.
