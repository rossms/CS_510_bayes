My seeing this was only a result of the theater we went to not having the movie we had hoped to see. But I must say I thought it was pretty good. I mean the flies (or whatever they were) flying out of the guy's mouth when he would heal someone caused the movie to take on what I thought to be an unnecassarily far-fetched role, but it was a pretty interesting movie. And Tom Hanks almost always knows how to choose the best movies to be in anyway.
