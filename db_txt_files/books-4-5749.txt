Agatha Christie cheats. She always has. No one gets all the clues so that you can solve the mystery with the sleuths. However, this doesn't stop her plots from being brilliant. She's the originator of the isolated group mystery. Just when you think you're safe, you aren't. Very tricky but effective.
