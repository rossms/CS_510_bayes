The Gaza Strip is one of the most densely populated areas in the world. It's full of refugees; plenty of political unrest. This is a major sore point in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. The port has been blockaded by Israel for the past few years, devastating the local economy. The unemployment here is very high, truly a very sad case here.
