His is an amazing coach that had some bad luck this year in the tourny. But all i can say is when you can lead a team to be the champions in the best confernce that says alot. You are awesome Roy! Dont give up you will get a title! You should have stayed at KU! When Simion and Langford are seniors the team could have been awesome with you!
