I looove this stuff. Sure, it's a bit pricey, but it's well worth it. Phish Food is my favorite -- it's rich chocolate ice cream with chocolate pieces in the shape of fish mixed in. When my best friend was dumped, I bought her a pint of Phish Food and I'll always associate that creamy goodness with break-ups and bad days, but it makes any awful situation absolutely delicious.
