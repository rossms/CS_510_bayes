I've tried XS (Tropical Blast flavor) along with AMP, Red Bull, and Adrenaline by Sobe in the past 6 months or so, and I must say XS is the best tasting of the bunch. It is also sugar-free, and taste-wise I couldn't tell the difference! I'd recommend this for anyone who drinks Energy Drinks. $2 a pop isn't cheap. But Energy Drinks are all about the same price.
