Just test drove the 2001. Felt too small and the price was too expensive, especially the options. The ride was decent, the inside was much nicer than the previous. Not much power expecially on the interstate. Seems like Toyota is getting overly proud and deciding to stick it to the consumer. I think I'll try the santa fe or escape.
