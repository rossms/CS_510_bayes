What's scary to me is how many people loved this film. Despite it being a comedy, I smiled only a handful of times and laughed out loud only once or twice. Some of the stuff was fairly clever, but it was mostly a predictable, unfunny hour and a half of my life (which I guess isn't much different than most of the hour and halfs of my life, but I digress). Don't bother.
