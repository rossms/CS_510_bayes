I really like Lake Placid and I've always had a very nice time there. It's kinda far to get to for a lot of people even in New England but worth the trip if you have more than a few days to stay. Good skiing, nice atmosphere, lots of hiking, camping, and boating to do, a nice place to spend a long weekend.
