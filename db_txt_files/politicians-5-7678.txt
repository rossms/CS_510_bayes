Made clear the importance of the separation of church and state. I wish Americans today could understand that. Faith is just that, a belief without solid evidence. We need leadership that can evaluate the information available to them without letting their faith lead them down a path that is only understood by those who share the faith. We speak poorly about Muslim people who follow their faith and their religious leaders blindly, hopefully we don't find ourselves behaving similarly.
