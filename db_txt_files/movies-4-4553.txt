Vey good family feature. Pixar has another hit on its hands. My problem with the movie is that it is a rip-off of the Fantasic Four. The Fantastic Four is the first family of comics. The powers and genders have been tweaked. The father is the Thing. The mother is Mister Fantastic. The daughter is the Invisible Girl. The son and the baby are a combo of the Human Torch. They actually fight a character that could pass for the Mole Man. Is this an homage or a stolen license?
