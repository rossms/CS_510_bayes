Best compact truck on the market! Beats the Ford Ranger and Chevy S10 (Colorado, too) hands down. If you want reliablity, don't buy a domestic brand truck, they are poorly slapped together and use cheap parts that do not last very long. Toyotas, by comparison, are built to exacting standards and have higher quality parts which last a very long time. Oh, and Toyota trucks are American made, that is unless California and Indiana are foreign countries. Many of the big 3 trucks are made in Mexico. Think about that before you blab out buy American.
