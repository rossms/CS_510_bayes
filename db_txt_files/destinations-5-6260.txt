Yea baby! It's all about the dirty south...so all you clean, sophisticated Yankees just stay up north ok? I think people talk to much trash about GA....and they say there are nothing but rednecks here. That is not true..let me be the first to tell ya. Unless you live here, you don't know what it's really like...so the Yanks need to quit trying to judge something that they have NO CLUE about. GA is hype!! And I love living here. Atlanta is also the bomb city....so new York just back on down!
