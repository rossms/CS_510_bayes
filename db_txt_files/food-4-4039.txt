One of the all time greats and still a favorite, although I'd be hard pressed to tell you that last time I actually purchased one of their big bags, more often than not it's just a little snack pack size. Still all through my youth Doritos were the chip to have and for a long time the only problem with Doritos was that they didn't have enough powdered flavoring on them. I used to love the occasional treat of finding a compressed chunk of powder at the bottom of a bag, like a bullion cube, for an extra burst of flavor. Sounds nasty doesn't it?
