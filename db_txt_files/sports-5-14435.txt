Steve Young is the greatest player of all time, no doubt. He carried the 49'ers to their last, most recent Superbowl. He is the greatest improviser, yet he is one of the greatest atheletes. He is a 5 in my book, although, I'm a Marion fan, by heart. Young is better than Montana; however, point blank.
