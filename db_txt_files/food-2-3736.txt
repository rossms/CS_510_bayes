There are two kinds of plain cookies in this world: ones that have an excellent taste to them (like Vanilla Wafers), and those that have no taste to them (like Animal Crackers). These are the kind that have no taste to them. I guess some people may like the plain, tasteless cookies, but I'd rather something a little better, especially considering that Girl Scout cookies are more expensive than cookies at the store.
