Yeah I know that PS2 has a better catalog of games right now but that will change with time. The xbox is the most powerful game system on the market and eventually the software will catch up with the hardware. Anybody who says that the xbox sucks needs to shut up and play Halo, that game is the baddest thing for any system, and Halo 2 is going to show just how superior xbox is to ps2 and gamecube. As for the controller, yes its a little awkward at first but anybody with hands larger than a dwarf's should be able to adjust after a little practice.
