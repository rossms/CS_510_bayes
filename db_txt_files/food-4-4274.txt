I have to admit, even after a lifetime of my father denouncing these as not real potato chips , that I really like Pringles. It's true they are totally processed potato that is then molded into shaped but who cares?!?! I mean who eats snack foods like the ones on this list because they are concerned with how authentic they are? Plain and simple Pringles just taste good, although they don't receive a 5 star rating mostly because I can't recall a time when I've eaten any great number of these and not felt nauseous, something I don't think I've ever felt after a bag of normal chips.
