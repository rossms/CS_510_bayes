I've had coffee at Gloria Jeans a few times with my girlfriend, its quality stuff. I had the butter rum latte both times, it was so good i just got it both times i went. Only problem is they dont sell Gloria Jean products at the store so i dont get to have it often. And i live about an hour from the nearest mall that sells it. I give this 5 stars
