Am Duke alum. Very ideologically left, so-called politically correct. Would like alternatives academically. Much and varied partying. Nice environmentally - campus, nearby woods, 4 seasons, central to beach and mountains. Seems to be having basketball block with Maryland, who I understand has a new T-shirt Cameron Indoor Stadium: Our Home Away From Home (so not right)
