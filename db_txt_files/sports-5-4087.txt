Bob Knight does more with the talent on hand than any coach in history. He is unbelieveably articulate and could have been a top TV announcer if he wanted to. OTOH, he is crude and a bit of a bully. The fact he hasn't done much the past 15 years is because today's top recruits don't want to put up with that kind of BS. Give Knight the kind of talent Roy Williams has had and he would have another 3-4 titles to his credit.
