Chris is so awesome! I have been a kings fan since I was a year old (Sacramento is my hometown), and even when we were a sucky team I stuck by them. Now that Chris has been here for a while, we have gotten so much better....our playing has improved greatly. I hope he decides to stay for more seasons, even if we don't succeed in getting far in the playoffs this year.
