My favorite. Full flavor, great taste, mild, . . and it almost smells like your smoking a pipe! Everyone I let sample them loved them, even my wife who is a hardcore menthol fan has been bumming them from me. The only bad side is, I truly can't stop reaching for the pack . . it's like having a bag of chocolate covered peanuts . . you just want MORE!!!! (the box is cool too)
