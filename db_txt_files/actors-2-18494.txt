I liked the quirky mad humour of his ealry stuff e.g. 'Take the money and run', 'Bananas' and 'Sleeper' but then he starts giving us all that overrated romcom cack about nauseating New Yorkers - 'Annie Hall', 'Manhattan' and 'Hannah and her sisters'. As there's much more of this than the early stuff.. 2 stars.
