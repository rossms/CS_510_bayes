This movie is enjoyable, but not as great as I was expecting from all the publicity. The performances by Queen Latifah, Zeta-Jones and Gere are wonderful, but I was not sold by Zellweger in her role. Some of the songs (the women in the prison) were fantastic - and Zeta-Jones really can sing. Also, if you are a fan of more traditional musicals (like West Side Story, the King and I, etc.), this might not be your cup of tea.
