How this guy isnt at no.1 here is a mystery to me-he is quite simply the greatest player ever to play basketball. If you have never seen any of these all time greats then try and get some of their footage on video via internet and although Bird and Magic were great-Jordan is still on another planet from them all. In my opinion he is just behind Muhammad Ali as the greatest sportsman ever to live.
