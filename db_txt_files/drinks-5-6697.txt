Ok well I used some of these ratings for a school assinment. They were mostly really helpful. My P.E teacher mr harrison says that gatorade and powerade are full of sugar...and you should only have abit at a time then have lots of water. Also if you drink too much without doing exercise it can have major effects and can cause dissyness and keeps you alert for too long therefore you lose sleep! thanks for the help in my assignment...but I'd better get back to doing it! see ya
