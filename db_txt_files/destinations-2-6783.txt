There isn't anything special about Omaha, Nebraska's largest city. Lincoln is a nice place with plenty of landmarks to gaze upon. The SAC musuem would definatly be worth a trip if you don't live too far. Go any further west of Lincoln and you're going to hit serveral hundred miles of void. Plus, Nebraskans have an unhealthy obsession with UNL football.
