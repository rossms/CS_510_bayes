I'm not going to say that he was perfect, because no one is, but for a president...America was lucky to have him. Everytime someone asks me who my historical role model is, I have to say, Abraham Lincoln , along with others who helped end slavery. Like I said, no one's perfect , but you can't condemn him for his flaws, when he made so many good contributions to American civil rights and the society, at the time, in general.
