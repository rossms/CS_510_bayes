A pretty nice record. Clapton's looking old, but somehow he doesn't sound it. Reptile, dedicated to his deceased uncle, has a few nice Clapton originals, two instrumentals, and quality James Taylor, Stevie Wonder, and Ray Charles covers. Nice feel-good music. If you get a chance, it's worth it to pick this one up.
