Jeffery Deaver I believe was the idea behind the CSI craze. His 'Lincoln Rhyme' novels are filled with crime scene investigations with a definite time limit to solve the life saving crime. Bone collector is my favorite of the series but all are worth a read. side plots and suprise endings are a speciality.
