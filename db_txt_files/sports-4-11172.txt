I support Lloyd Carr and Michigan. I am a season ticket holder and a long time fan. I refuse to jump on the "fire Carr bandwagon." they will be back next year...older and mature. they are a young team plagued by injuries this year. Overal he has done great at Michigan, and to call for his job over a "rebuilding season" is ignorant. If history repeats itself after our last Alamo Bowl lost, we won the national title. Maybe not a national title next year, but everytime they have a "so-so" season they come back strong the following year for outstanding year. Michigan for 2006 Big ten Champs! GO BLUE
