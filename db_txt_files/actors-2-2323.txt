Terrible mullet in 'Lethal Weapon' series. His versions of the war of independence and William Wallace are total distortions and strangely anti-British. Also, miscast in 'Chicken Run'. And talking of foul, he's also been in some real turkeys e.g. 'Tequila Sunrise', 'The man without a face','Forever young', 'The Patriot' , 'Payback', 'Conspiracy theory', 'Ransom' etc etc
