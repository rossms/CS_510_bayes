Benito is the most interesting player in the MLB, unique for his throw from the knees, for his age and still playing well at the most physically demanding position. All this even after nearly getting killed in a car accident a few years ago. He proved wrong the doctors who said he would never play baseball again! He credits God for that, and takes nothing for granted anymore.
