I visited Disneyland when I was very young, then got to go back 30 years later. I was amazed that so little had changed. Even the trash receptacles looked like the exact same ones. Although there were a few new rides (and some old ones no longer there), it was so much like it had been years ago that it was like stepping into a time capsule. It's very clean & if you don't waste your money on the overpriced refreshment stands, it's worth the money. I'm glad I got to take my own children to walk through nearly the same experience I'd had so long ago.
