I'm tempted to give Spike a FIVE star rating b/c Being John Malkovich was so brilliant, as were so many of his videos (from the B'Boys Sabotage on). But I suppose that limited history shouldn't qualify you as a peer to Hitchcock -- not yet anyway. Also, I'm not sure how his promotional video for Al Gore at the 2000 convention should affect this rating. As someone who detests Gore, I'm irked that he did it, but then the film really illuminated what an oddball Gore was, so perhaps it was a public service after all...
