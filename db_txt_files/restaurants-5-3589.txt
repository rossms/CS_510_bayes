Hail Caesar! I ate at LC's in 2000 during a visit to the US and I give it the thumbs up. The food there was pure luxury compared to the ghastly fish and chip restaurants back home in the UK. The chips you get there are so hard they would cut your skin if you got stabbed by one. For a rip off price of 8, you too can eat a plate full of toxic waste.
