As a kid I didn't really like Snickers too much. I think it was the peanuts that scared me but I soon overcame my fear and went for it. Snickers are great. I really like Milkway and Snickers is a Milkyway with nuts which just makes it that much better. If only I could be a kid again and have the luxery of eating one.
