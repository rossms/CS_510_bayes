I cut my teeth on Guinness beer, which meant I was never going to find watery American favorites like Bud and Miller very enjoyable. Nowadays, I find Guinness a little too intense, and Sam Adams has become my go-to happy medium. Full-bodied, full-flavored, rich, and satisfying, with a gorgeous color, delightful scent, and pleasing complexity of flavors. Nothing else tastes like it; you could pick it out of a lineup, and for all the right reasons. For my money, it's the best American beer on the market, hands down. Bud and Miller still taste like water to me ... I don't get the appeal.
