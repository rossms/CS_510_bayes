The one sequel that makes absolutly no sense at all. Why does his mother come back at the end with her head reattached only to be left out of the remaining sequels? They should have gone with the mother side plot. I love the funky disco beginning though. It is fun to watch all the things that were once 3-D and are just now things on wires or unnecassary close ups of different objects. cute. See with friends.
