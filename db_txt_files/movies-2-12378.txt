I didn't like it. The acting was average to weak, a bit too much CGI help (which many are relying on way too much lately) and a predictable story (yes, I know it was based on a book). I read the book about twenty years ago and had forgotten everything, but was just not impressed by this film. I certainly would not go to a sequel.
