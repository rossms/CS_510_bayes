This is a great service the people there are verry friendly and one of them acctually belivied me for once that my dvd is all sceatched up when I goy it and they gave me another copy and they even checked if it was unscratched or not unlike block buster who didn't believe and made me pay more than I origanly paid for when I first goi it which for your'e infor mation was from seven to elleven dollars so go to hollywood videos they rock.
