I am not a fan of base ball and it is probably partially due to the treatment of Pete Rose. If this guy is not put in the Hall of Fame before he dies it will go down as probably one of the biggest blunders of all time. I don't care what he did or did not do, you get into the Hall for what you did on the field and if any one deserves to be in the MLB hall of fame it is Pete Rose.
