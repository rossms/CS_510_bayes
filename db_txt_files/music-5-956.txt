The Albumm that released byy Everclear was simply brillant. It puts you in a position some people don't realize they are doing unless someone tells them. So Much For The Afterglow was simply brillant. It only takes true genisus such as Art Craig (The cuttest one), and Greg to come up with this masterpiece.. Whether people like it or not face it everyone in their life time will want to be differrent and THIS IS THE PERFECT BAND cause their taste is never the same. THeir newly release cd is just... their is no word to describe how great or GOOD it is.. ThE GrEat OnE_00
