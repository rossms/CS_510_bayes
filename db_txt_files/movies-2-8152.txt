Jim Carrey has some roles that you just can't stand, and this is one of his roles. Sure, it may be fun seeing Jennifer Tilly still acting, but Jim is just so unfunny and annoying. It's not fun watching someone abuse themselves like he does with his role, and being a lousy father, finally seeing what's wrong with him???
