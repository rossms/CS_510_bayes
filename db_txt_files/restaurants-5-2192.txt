Orange Julius is a nice change of pace from other fast food chains when you are out and about shopping or whatever you like to do on a lazy weekend. Their beverages are very refreshing and almost always hit the spot. Usually you can find an Orange Julius in almost every mall in America. The last time I checked, Orange Julius was owned by International Dairy Queen, based in Minneapolis, Minnesota. And this would be another explanation as to why their beverages are so good ! I don't know any fast food chain that makes you feel as happy as Dairy Queen does after a visit...
