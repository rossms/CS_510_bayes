5+++ Senator McCain is awesome. Courageous, fearless, and a staunch Republican, he is a loyal and superb complement to any Republican party mix. He is intelligent, authentic, and genuine. His style is fair and balanced. He is unwavering and compassionate. Having spent many of his young adult years as a P.O.W., he brings unique and insightful experience to the floor of the senate. God Bless John McCain.
