The Canadian version is better. Rye (bourbon to you Yanks) and ginger ale instead of seven-up. The seven-up makes it too sweet, the rye is sweet enough, so ginger ale is the way to go. A warm, feel good drunk but always got in fights when I drank this in the Navy. As the east coasters say It get's ya fired up!!!
