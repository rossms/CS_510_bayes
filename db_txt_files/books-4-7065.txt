1st book: excellent, 2nd book: ok, 3rd book: So far so good. I was very dissapointed with Royal Assasin! The ending left me with no desire to read the next book! Fitz seems to encounter obstacle after obstacle, and I am begining to find it all very depressing! Who wants to read 1000pgs+ about someone's failures and weaknesess! The only thing that is keeping me going is Robin Hobb's abiltity to write charaters that captivate you! Also...I just keep waiting for something good to happen!
