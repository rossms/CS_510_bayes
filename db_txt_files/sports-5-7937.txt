This youthful phenom did live up to the hype. I was one of the skeptics regarding the time it would take King James to get acclamated to the NBA. He has effectively mitigated all doubts as to his incredible talent on even the pro level. He is leading the Cavs back from their losing ways at the beginning of the season and he's put them right in the playoff hunt. Will remain among the league's elite for years to come.
