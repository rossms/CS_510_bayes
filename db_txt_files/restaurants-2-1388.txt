Location: Huntsville, AL. Jordon Lane. Food: decent. Like the slushes. Service: Acceptable. Speed: horrible. My past 3 visits have resulted in at least 30 minutes of waiting. Just this evening I waited 30 minutes for a cookie-dough blast. The vehicles beside me, both of which order after me & had several meals as part of their order, received them before I got mine. Once the server arrived, I was given the wrong size without as much as an apology. I will not be visiting this Sonic anymore.
