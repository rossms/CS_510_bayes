This is a great state! Yes there are areas that are superficial and over populated, but if you have only traveled to California cities then you have only experienced a part of California. Yes the people are wierd and different, but that is what makes it such a great place, the people choose to deviate from sterotypical conformists that inhabit much of central America. The north coast and the red wood forests are espeically beautiful.
