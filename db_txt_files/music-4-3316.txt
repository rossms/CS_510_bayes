If only this site had a four and a half star rating--what prevents this album from getting five stars is Mike Love's cheesy Student Demonstration Time, woefully dated and woefully unmusical. But some of the tracks on this underrated album are superb, especially the title track, a classical wonder, Feel Flows, and til I Die, a Brian Wilson masterwork. To this day I play this more than Pet Sounds.
