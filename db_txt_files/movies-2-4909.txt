I don't know if you can really classify this, it is not a kid's movie as most of it is some what depressing. It not a comedy because it is really not funny and its not a drama because, well its just not. Bruce looks akward in this and looked like he was forfilling a contract obligation. The kid is good and some what funny. Well I guess it is more sci fi than any thing else but not really.
