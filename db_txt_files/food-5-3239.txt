I realy like the taste of the dinners. I really don't have a favorite, because I like food with fkavor & they all have it. I eat a bowl of ceral for breakfast & a glass of no fat milk & usually a slice of wheat bread with lettuce & healthy choice meat for lunch & a apple, & for dinner i have a lean cusine dinner & water. I drink lots of water daily. I have lost 8 pounds in alittle over a month. Thanks for making such great tasting dinners.
