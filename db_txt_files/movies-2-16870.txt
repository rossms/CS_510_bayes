This is probably a three star movie, but I have to give it two stars because I had high expectations for Any Given Sunday, and it didn't even come close to meeting them. Cameron Diaz, who I think is beautiful, just wasn't believable as the tough-as-nails team owner. The plot was unfocused, Al Pacino's talent was wasted, and the movie dragged. If you're gonna make a football movie, at least do something original. And making it look and sound like a music video doesn't count. Avoid this movie unless you're desperate.
