First cig I smoked. 14 and my friend had just swiped a pack from his aunt. Nothing like two 14 year old badasses like us talking about how this was the best smoke we'd ever had and how good the buzz was (even though we'd never had any other and couldn't inhale without coughing). I've since moved to Dunhills, Marlboro's etc but every once in a while I buy a pack and the nostalgia brings back some awesome memories. I'd give these 500 stars if I could.
