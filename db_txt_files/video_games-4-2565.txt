. . . did I just play a game where I stuck something up someone's nose? Yeah, it's that weird, and that's the impression that I got from just playing about five minutes of it in EB. A series of little odd mini-games that comes at you so fast you feel like you suddenly got A.D.D., it's somehow strangely addicting, and it IS a good showcase of the Nintendo DS's touch-screen features. It's not enough to make me consider getting a DS (I'm still holding out to get the PSP, but that's not going to happen anytime soon), but it's a cute game for those who have the system.
