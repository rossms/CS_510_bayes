the guy can shoot, congratulations. the simple fact is that if he isn't playing well, duke has nothing else to back them up. i dont care about his background or anything like that. i think he has a bad attitude and acts unclassy on the court. he tried to start stuff with paul at the wake game, and i hope he tries to make that same mistake with the heels, cuz mccants will shut him up quick. he is gonna get shut down tonite anyway, so im not too worried about it.
