I am very much impressed with Elijah's earlier work, such as: The War and Radio Flyer. I must admit that from Flipper on I have not been too impressed. I think he is capable of tremendous acting, but has not had the roles lately. He has a very real believablity, and I like his style.I hope to see him in the the kind of roles I think he's capable of.
