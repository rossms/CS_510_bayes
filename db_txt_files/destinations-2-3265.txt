The place is clean, I'll give it that, but that's primarily because it rains so much they don't need to wash anything that's outdoors. Grey, dour and drizzle invested, with a Starbucks every twenty feet (and mightily bad coffee that is, but don't get me started) this is a place full of mildew. Such might explain their professional sports franchises, which always seem to show so much promise before wilting under pressure.
