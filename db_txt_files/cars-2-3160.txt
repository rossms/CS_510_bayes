I own a 2003 4Runner. Good looking SUV, gas mileage 16 mpg,but only 2.5 yrs old & now I have a leaking front shock & a bad back shock. Only 49,900 miles on it & mostly hiway, no off road. Toyota cares, says sorry Eddie not under warranty even though I have had my car religously serviced by them. $600 to replace the front shocks in 2.5 yrs. You gotta be kidding me.Plus now a problem with the back ones. Don't think I'll be buying another toyota in the future.
