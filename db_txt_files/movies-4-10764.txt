My Aunt told me that I had to see this movie- that it was hilarious. So I finally saw it, and while it was not hilarious, it truly was worth watching. As Wiggum said, it moves along quickly and there are some funny moments along the way. All of the different characters that Brenden Frasier takes on are hilarious- I really don't have a favorite- I enjoy them all! This is definately worth watching if you're in the mood for light comedy and one gorgeous Elizabeth Hurley.
