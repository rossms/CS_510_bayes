Gotta love the frosted oats. A little more fat than some of the other sugar cereals, but well worth it. When I was a kid, they changed the formula, it sucked, and they subsequently switched it back (I wish I could claim some victoy by way of a letter writing campaign, but just I guess everyone else hated it, too).
