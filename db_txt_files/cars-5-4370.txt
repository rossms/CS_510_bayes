A great van! Just what I was looking for. Wife didn't want big van, this one had features not found on Chevy or Chrysler. Bought it in 2001, 1996 model, only 36,000 miles. One problem with valve lifters, corrected under extended warranty. Otherwise, it has run great! Use it as a daily driver and for towing a camper. Definately recommend the 96-98 models.
