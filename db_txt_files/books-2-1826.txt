The title of this strip is quickly becoming ironic, because we're now in the latter phase. The problem is that we, as readers, didn't say I do. There was a Fox Trot strip a while back that was serious for a moment, and the character Jason said Aaah! I'm in 'For Better or Worse!' That pretty much sums it up. The characters aren't fun anymore and there's always a depressing problem brewing.
