Not only has Stoops won a NC, 3 big 12 Championships, beaten Texas five Straight, has only lost two games at home, he has the best winning % since 2000.That's why he is the best coach in the nation. He made the 1999 team into stars and teh next year and that's what he does every year. He also takes in 2.3 million a year (the most of any coach). And o yeah...Texas better not get used to winning against OU...a win will only come for them about 1 out of six years.
