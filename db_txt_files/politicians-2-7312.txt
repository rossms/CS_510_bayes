Jesse, if you really, really want to help the black race; when you make your next trip abroad in the name of peace or whatever your cause is at the time, why don't you visit Somalia, where tribes still practice the barbaric ritual of female circucision. That would be a good place for you to help your brothers and sisters that are much more suppressed and oppressed than they are here.
