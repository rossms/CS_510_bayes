I really like the original version of Aerosmith's Walk This Way , but I have to admit that the addition of RUN-DMC in this remake was a great idea. The mixtures of rock and rap actually worked out extermely well, and it shows that a song can be done in different styles and still rock! It may very well have been a groundbreaking video and brought two different genres together. Plus, the video itself was just fun!
