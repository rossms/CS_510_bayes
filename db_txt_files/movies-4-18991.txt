A classic horror film. When most people think of the classic Universal Monsters, they think of Dracula, they think of the Creature From The Black Lagoon, they think of the Wolf Man, but first, they think of Frankenstein. A wonderful start to Boris Karloff's career. And of course, without him, there would be no Munsters!
