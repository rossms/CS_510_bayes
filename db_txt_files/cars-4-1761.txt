Very recently bought a Five Hundred SEL. Too early to tell if it should be rated as a 5. A very nice sedan for the money - lots of standard features, and a couple of nifty bells and whistles. May be a bit underpowered at 203 HP, but it handles very nicely, is super quiet, has comfortable seats (rear legroom is exceptional), and gets decent gas mileage. Ford ought to offer a better warranty (36K/3 year is standard).
