Dairy Queen seems to have the monopoly on good soft ice cream. As many of the other comments have noted, their specialty is the Blizzard, which is ice cream with something mixed in (eg a crushed candy bar). My personal favorite is chocolate with wet walnuts though it isn't on the menu. Nevertheless, specialty ice cream establishments have gourmet versions of a Blizzard that are typically better.
