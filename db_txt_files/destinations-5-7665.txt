We used the lightrail directly from the airport and found it was a fast, safe and cost very little to get within 2 blocks of the waterfront. Once there we spent a good part of the afternoon shopping and just enjoying a beautiful day. The people were very friendly - the area seemed safe and well monitored and I must say that it was exceptionally clean for a high volume tourist area. We would definitely recommend it.
