Sounds like you either like it or don't like it from this board. I have to side with not liking the ice cream which I would not call ice cream. It is not creamy at all. Maybe this is a fad? I think people seem to like it if they like a particular mix-in product, but i think you can do better with a Ben & Jerry's, Dreyer's or Haagen Dazs ice cream.
