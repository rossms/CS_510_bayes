The only bad things I could possibly say about Jack in the Box are that the food is fattening and the prices are a little high, but you get that at almost any fast food places. Jack in the Box food is always high quality, and worth every penny. The commercials are true, they don't make it till you order it. I love the way the curly fries are always so curly and how the bacon is always crispy in (my favorite!) the sourdough jack.
