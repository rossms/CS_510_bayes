I dont think people pay any attention to truth. Kobe is not a sellfish player(he leads the lakers in assists with about 5 a game). Just because he can score at will and takes 23 shots a game, doesn't mean he is not a team player. Shaq is great, no doubt, but Kobe can create more on offense, and is much more reliable on the free throw line(89%) did anyone see the other night against Charlotte 25pts, 10assists, 10 rebounds. By far without any doubt he is the best all-around player in the league!!!!
