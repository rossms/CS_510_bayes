Great to see a minority that is willing to see through the garbage the Democrats are always feeding them. I find it funny how all the people who feel negatively about him are against him because he is black and therefore shouldn't be a Republican. Well I m sure they can appreciate that he can think for himself and doesn t blindly follow the out of date lies that the Democratic Party is the party for minorities.
