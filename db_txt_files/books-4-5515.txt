I haven't finished reading it, I started all over again coz I attempted to read it last year, but I didn't want to continue. I'm about one-fourth finished with the book and it's quite interesting. It's a small philosophy reference book and has a delicate plot in it. I can't wait to get to the end... I'm just relatively excited.
