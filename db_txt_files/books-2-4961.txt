Very interesting at times, but a definite STINKER. Most of it was boring. Sometimes, entire chapters were extremely boring. The characters, I think, were very well explained. Each one had it's own characterstics and traits. I found Dimmesdale to be the most interesting of the bunch. Not a page turner. A nice piece, but boring. Not reccomended to anyone, especially youngens. I think I can sum it up as, BORING.
