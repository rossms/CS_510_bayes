While their chicken is unique, and terrific, in my calorie counting mid-life I go for their tender roast chicken sandwich. It's the best in the business! Update: I feel sorry for people who eat American fastfood overseas. I ate at KFC in Saudi Arabia and I'm still trying to figure out what was served to me. Something happens to American food somewhere in the mid-Atlantic. It's not the same.
