I used to think Catherine Zeta Jones was stunning. Lately however, she's looking more and more like her husband's wife. How is she aging so rapidly when she's reportedly only about 34 or 35? She looks easily mid 40's lately. What's more is she looks so depressed! I have a feeling she's waking up mornings and realizing she married an elderly man.
