As far as I'm concerned, this place is the King of amusement parks. I went to college at the University of Michigan, and Cedar Point was close enough for a day trip, so I made it there at least two or three times. The rides were amazing - especially the one that simulates free-fall. I've been to quite a few other parks, and none of them compare in size or quality/variety of rides.
