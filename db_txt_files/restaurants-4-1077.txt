I also haven't been here in years, I still see them around but now they are just another run of the mill fast food place, nothing special. I loved going as a kid, they'd bring the food to your car on a tray and remember the burgers, Papa Burger, MaMa Burger and Teen Burger, also great chilidogs. The root beer was is awesome but tastes best when you get it in the authentic glass mug.
