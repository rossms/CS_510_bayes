Australia should be abolishing the ETA (Electric Travel Authority) and replace to ETA free between 3 to 6 months for most tourists and visiters from most countries. Most non-communist countries not required a tourist visa for foreign tourists and visitors. Why Australia requires ETA or a tourist visa except New Zealanders? Although New Zealand not requires a tourist visa within 3 months for most other citizens.
