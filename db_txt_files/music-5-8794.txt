The first time I saw the video, I thought to myself What the ****? , but then, after a while, the song and the vid grew on me. I is an awesome video...I like the blend of 2-D animation and 3-D graphics. It gives the video a really cool touch. Plus, the dancing gorillas are really fun to watch...they crack me up. It would be really cool to watch the video on a larger screen, like the size of a movie screen, and watch it in real 3-D with those 3-D glasses. That would be an experience! Anyways, awesome vid and really cool song...I love 2-D's voice.
