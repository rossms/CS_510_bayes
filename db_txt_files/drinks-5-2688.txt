Out of all the major grocery stores that sell coffee, like Albertsons, Safeway, Top Foods, Fred Meyer, etc, etc, etc. Chase & Sanborn is by far the Best canned coffee I have ever had! It's smooth, never bitter has a mild flavor. It's just very difficult for me to find, I usually have to have my parents pick me some up from the commisary on base!
