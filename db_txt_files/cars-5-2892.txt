My fav car. Who say's it doesn't last?? I have an 84 camaro with over 200,000 miles and it still runs just fine, starts on the first turn every time. It may not be as fast as some of these new cars, but hey, it's the eighties. Best bang for the buck. I saw a 99 SS for $12,000, that's 320 hp, if you take care of it, it will last! drop a 2- 3000 dollar supercharger in it, you'll smoke a Viper, I've seen it. Camaros rule. and by the way, not everybody that drives them is white trash.
