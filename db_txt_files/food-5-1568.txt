I've been on a Skittles kick lately. I like Skittles because the flavors are intense and very sweet and they are low in fat. I can eat a few Skittles and feel completely satisfied, while other candies (e.g. peanut M Ms) cause me to lose complete control. Skittles aren't as sticky and difficult to chew as Starbursts, and I like their small size and hard outer coating which doesn't melt in your hand. All of the flavors are good, but I especially like tropical Skittles. In fact, I can't think of a single way to improve this delicious candy.
