It's a very good idea for a game, but the execution is very buggy and ill-explained. The game requires an intuitive guide not to creature-rearing or movement, which it has, but to proper town management, which is frustrating to a newcomer. Nearly all the quests amount to either looking for something or drawing designs with the mouse. Man, if I wanted to spend an hour looking for something, I'd try to find my pants.
