Cheesecake is BY FAR the best restaurant I've ver been to (DC, LA & Miami - Coconut Grove & at Dadeland). They have a huge variety of entrees from thai dishes to jumbalaya pasta. You can't go wrong with anything on the menu - including the 30 or so cheesecakes. Recommended: Bang-bang chicken, chicken madeira, thai noodle salad, any steak & entire brunch menu.
