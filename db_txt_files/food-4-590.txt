i would really give this a 4.5. Good old Rice Krispies. they have been around forever I still like a bowl of Rice Krispies. It brings back memories from childhood. With Snap, Krackle,and Pop elves. Pitching the cereal. And most People have had a Rice Krispie bar at least once. I cheat and put sugar on mine. It is one of the cereals the whole family likes.
