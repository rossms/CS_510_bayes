Excel is a necessity for most computer users and it is easy to use. I am still and will continue to learn tricks about creating spreadsheets, graphs and charts that I did not previously know about. That little paper clip office assistant dud is also very helpful. Just type in a question and he gives you a list of options and then very detailed instructions on how to complete the task you are tackling.
