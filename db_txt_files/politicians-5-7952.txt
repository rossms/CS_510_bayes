I wish I had been around when FDR was President. He seems like he was wonderfully inspiring;but not only did he inspire, he took action. He was truly a hero, and all the presidents who followed him pale in comparison to his resplendent example. UPDATE: Yes, wasn't FDR so demonic actually coming up with these awful programs to help people get jobs and get out of the hole! Shameless government interference! I hear that before the evil FDR took office starving families lived in tent cities called Hoovervilles. Isn't this just so cute and original? Talk about cheap housing!
