Ben is funny! I loved him in Meet the Parents. He was absolutley hilarious in it. As for acting in a serious roll, like in Keep the Faith (he was funny in that too, don't get me wrong) he had some moments were he had to the serious thing. He did ok. I think he is someone that we should look forward to in drama movies. Look, Tom Hanks stunk in a lot of his ha ha movies, but he turned out to be a massive theatrical contributor. Ben gets into his rolls also, but not completely.
