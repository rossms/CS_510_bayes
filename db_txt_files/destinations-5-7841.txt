An absolutely beautiful aquarium, with a terrific view along the lakefront that makes it look like the aquarium's pool is a continuous part of Lake Michigan. An amazing array of fish and mammals are covered here, including a fun dolphin show, a creepy shark exhibit, and surprisingly beautiful seahorses. Very impressive.
