The slogan that Snapple has describes it all, made from the best stuff on Earth . The peach tea is the best iced tea on the market. It's like bitting into a fresh juicy peach, what a burst of flavor. I would like to see Snapple come back with their strawberry iced tea, it was just as good as the peach. WARNING: once you try Snapple peach iced tea you will be hopelessly addicted.
