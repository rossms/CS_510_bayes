When parmesan is grated fresh it is truly wonderful. I've even cut chunks off to eat. This cheese has to be grated fresh, though. The Kraft stuff you buy in the sprinkle can at the grocery store is not even worth using. Go to Trader Joes and get a block of it to great. It's wonderful in any Italian dish!
