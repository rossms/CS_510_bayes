The first time I ever bought this was in Reno at a small liquor store and I was so nervous that the guy would not accept my fake ID. I just went up to the counter and picked up a huge bottle of Bacardi 151 and set it on the counter. As the guy behind the counter rang it up he asked for my ID, so I showed him my Colorado and he accepted it and asked me how the weather there was. I was nervous that I could hardly answer him. So from now on, when I see Bacardi 151 it brings me back to that night.
