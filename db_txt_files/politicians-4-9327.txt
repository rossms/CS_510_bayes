Coolidge was a good president. He was known as Silent Cal . This is what made him a good president; he believed in a small government. This aspect of his presidency contributed to the boom in the 1920's. If he had remained president after 1928, I could probably tell you that there would have been a recession, but not a depression. Hoover gave in to the progressives and their vision of a massive government which turned a recession into a depression. Coolidge never would have.
