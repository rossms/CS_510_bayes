I love WinCo, the prices are great better than Food for Less and WinCo is ALWAYS clean unlike their competitors. When are you going to put a WinCo in Eagle Point, Oregon or White City or even Shady Cove. The one in Medford is pretty far when you live almost into Butte FAlls. Thanks for great prices and clean stores. Crystal Shelton
