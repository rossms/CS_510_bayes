Now this is an absolutely delightful AND educational game to play. I love the looks on small childrens' faces when they learn to match colors and shapes, and as an adult and teacher, it's a priceless way to spend time with children and give them your love and attention. This is one of the few games that encourages gentle cooperation and caters to the child in all of us. I played this game when I was small, and I really get a kick out of watching little ones learn to help one another and to work together.
