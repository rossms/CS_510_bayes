A very good album; certainly not the equal of SFAM in that SFAM was a single cohernt opus and Six Degrees is a raging hodgepodge of songs, but they're generally very good songs. If you're a DT fan, get it. If you like the genre (prog metal, a la Fates Warning, classic Iron Maiden, Tool, Queensryche...) it's a must for your collection. But then again so is SFAM.
