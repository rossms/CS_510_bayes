Very good bagels, however not as good as Bruegger's, which have more flavor and 'snap' to them. Their coffee is very good as well. However, they do tend to burn their Asiago bagels from time to time, and they are getting cheap with the amount of Asiago cheese they put on their bagels. Put more Asiago cheese on there for chrissakes! All in all, a very good place for breakfast or a light lunch. I know I am addicted to my local Einstein's, where they know me on a 'first name' basis!
