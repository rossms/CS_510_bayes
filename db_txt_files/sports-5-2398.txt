Awesome team this year! Sure, they lost Richie Sexson, but since then, they've been doing excellent with all the new players they got from Arizona. Ben Sheets has pitched some really great games. They have a lot of potential and the players work well together. They won't get to the World Series this year, but maybe in a couple of years they will. I'm rooting for 'em.
