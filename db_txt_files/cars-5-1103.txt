Based on my experience with a 1992 Civic sedan (manual transmission), I'd recommend it to anyone shopping for a car this size. Sold mine in 2001, and at nine years and about 112K miles, it never had any major problems. Ran well, got great gas mileage (up to 40 mpg, but that was somewhat of a fluke - 36-37 was more like it), and was a lot of fun to drive.
