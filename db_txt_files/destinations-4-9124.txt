Yes, it is nice. bring your camera. . .it only loses one star because it is always crowded and very touristy. . .but if you are in Beijing, you simply have to go. Don't waste your money on a guided tour - just go from exhibit to exhibit and pick up information from other tours in any one of several languages! This also gives you the flexibility of spending the amount of time you want at a given exhibit. Everyone's pictures from the Forbidden City look the same, but they're still worth taking. Look at my review for the city of Beijing.
