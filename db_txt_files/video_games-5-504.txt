Money makes the world go 'round, the world go 'round...and the little dog, and the shoe and the race car. I love this game! How often do you get a chance to experience buying real estate and houses like an oil baron? And back before you had to pretend you were mature it was also a great way to get your aggressions out on your sister. Let her get a few hotels, get in an argument and then flip the board. Muhahahahaha!
