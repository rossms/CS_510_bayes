Well to respond to the guy who said that the busa blows and he is waiting for the kawasaki 1400. I raced one of those kawasaki 1400s which was owned by a man who raced motorcycles for a living and all I can say is that dont waste your money on a kawasaki. They are truely a worthless waste of time and money.
