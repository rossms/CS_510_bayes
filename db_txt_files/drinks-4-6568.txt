Wow! The only way to describe this is to say it's like Dr. Pepper, only more so. No, that doesn't quite do it justice, but it'll give you some idea. I think it's something of an acquired taste - you may like it more your 3rd time, than your first or second. Anyhow, what will probably turn most people off (and cause others to swear by it) is the bitter aftertaste. Word of warning: don't have it with spicy food, or combustion may result!
