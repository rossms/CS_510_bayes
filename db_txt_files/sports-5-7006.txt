This has nothing to do with black and white. He was an incredible basketball player, one can't deny that. I wouldn't go so far as to call him the best of all time, but he's definitely one of the great's. And to the Sport Geru ... Kobe (note the spelling) although a great player, is not comparable to Bird on the all time list.
