I went to check out this school back in the late 80s when I was visiting potential schools that I might attend aftre graduating high school. Pretty much a liberal arts school in CT back then and it is my understanding that it is still the same these days. Along with being a liberal arts school, I remember it being a very liberal environment - a lot of people being individuals, so there was a real diverse crowd that made up the student body. I sat in on a couple of classes and was impressed with the quality of the curriculum.
