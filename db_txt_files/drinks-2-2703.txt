I can't take these guys seriously thanks to the internet cartoons of Foamy the Squirrel. You can look it up if you want to watch, but the cartoons about "starshmucks" have convinced me that Starbucks is the devil. The sizes of coffee are rigged to play a trick on your brain. You order a tall and you get the smallest cup they offer. HUH? I am not comfortable paying three dollars for "a urine sample size cup of coffee swill!" (credit Foamy on that) COFFEE HOUSE PROPAGANDA NO MORE!
