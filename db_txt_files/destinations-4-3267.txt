You know when you watch the McDonald's commercials on TV with the real attractive employees and you think to yourself Riigghhht. Well these employees do exist and will work for $6 an hour in Seattle. All the girls were attractive. I was also impressed at the cleanliness of the city, and how easy it was to get around. The football and baseball stadiums are very cool. People are pretty chill. The climate is dreary and can get you down but is pretty moderate. The air is clean and you feel pretty healthy up there. Also the radio stations are the best I've ever heard.
