Ronald Reagan is one of the most overrated presidents ever. His accreditaion to ending communism is nothing more than him claiming responsibility for something he had nothing to do with. Socialism causes poverty may have some truth to it, but its even more true when a capitalistic nation allows its companies to run amok in the world.
