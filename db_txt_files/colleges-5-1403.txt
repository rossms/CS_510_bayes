I am an alumni and employee of Newberry College, therefore, I am biased on the subject. My experience was a great one and continues to be to this day. Newberry is not for everyone, but can well prepare anyone for a bright future. It all depends on the attitude of the student. It is a small environment that offers a more personalized education. We are a small school with lofty ambitions for growth and success, and make no mistake about it- we WILL achieve those goals!
