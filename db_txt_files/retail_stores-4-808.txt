I LOVE The Limited's tops, sweaters, and accessories. In fact I have a sweater that I bought there 8 years ago that still looks like new. I have found that most of their skirts do not fit me right though. It is as if the back is shorter than the front. I also wish that there were petites and size 0 and 2.
