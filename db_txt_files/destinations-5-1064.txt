I've only been to Sydney and Melbourne, so I can't comment on the vast majority of the country, but I have nothing but great things to say about Australia. Melbourne wasn't quite as impressive to me as Sydney, but both cities have great attractions and friendly people. While I was in Sydney, the weather was perfect, and I was able to easily get around to lots of interesting places by hopping on a tourist bus line that runs in a loop and lets you get on and off anywhere. I can't wait to get back there and explore places like Alice Springs and the Great Barrier Reef.
