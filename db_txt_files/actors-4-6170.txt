i definitely think this guy is underrated. i was very impressed with dead again, and then i caught him playing a smooth-talking gestapo in swing kids. i loved both movies and watched them many times but he was so different between the two roles it took me a while to realize they were him. and then he did the voice of a very different role in the road to el dorado
