Even though Vancouver is not as vibrant as Toronto, it is still a wonderful overall city. The fantastic and stunning beauty of Vancouver will make you forget about all the small annoyances the city has to offer. The people are downright polite and actually have pride in where they live and there is nothing wrong with that at all. If I lived in Canada, this would be my 2nd choice city to live in....
