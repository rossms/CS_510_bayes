After a tough loss to U-Mass a couple of years ago, John Chaney marched into John Calipari's press conference and threatened to kill him on the spot. Chaney was willing to fight for his players b/c he thought Calipari dissed them. Chaney's passion fuels the best team in the Big 5 year in and year out.
