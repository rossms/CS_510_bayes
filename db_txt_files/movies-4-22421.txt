Good to see that Lucas learnt his lesson after the awful Phantom Menace and produced a far better movie. The special effects are among the few computer generated ones that actually looked real in modern films, and were a vast improvement on Episode I. The acting was far better, the story more interesting, less Jar-Jar and the ties between this and Episode IV begin to show already. Some complained about the overly long romance scenes, but with Natalie Portman looking like she does, I'm not one of them ;). Overall, a huge improvement. Still not up there with the original 3, but very close.
