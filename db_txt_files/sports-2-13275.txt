Cant win enough in a weak league. When they do win, they cant get to a Bowl. Rice has the problems a private school playing Div-1 have: small fan base, high academic standards, no history to build off of, inability to attract big time talent, weak coaching. Thing is, the school's got money and if they wanted to heavily invest in fielding a top notch program they could.
