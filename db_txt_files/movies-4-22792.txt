fantastic visual interrpretation of the first novel in the Potter series. a little long in the tooth b/c of Colombus' wanting to appease the book fans. still good stuff. although after reading the Harry Potter books i renounced god and took up w/a cult that practices witchcraft and black magic. that wasn't even the worst part. all the other witches and wizards were 11 year old orphans, shunned by society, now working for evil. who knew?
