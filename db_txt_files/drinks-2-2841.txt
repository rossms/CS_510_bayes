I have been drinking Tasters Choice Decaf for many years, you know( the green jar)with a screw on lid.Well the last time I went to buy a jar I couldn't find it. I had to ask what happened to it. Well now I have this cute (red) container that doesn't stay closed. My coffee doesn't stay fresh in the container. I guess I will have to find another brand. Sorry wrong container, cute put not practible.
