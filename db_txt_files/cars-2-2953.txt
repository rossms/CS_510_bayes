Unique styling, unique engine, unique performance traits. Unique doesn't equal good. Claimed to be a true 4 seater sport car but barely has enough torque to haul the car uphills. Reliability is always a question with these rotaries' Mazda is already having problems with gas milage, inflated power rating and flooding issues. I'd rather if they had used a conventional 4 cylinder turbo or a Ford V6 in this car. Handling is nimble and impressive, and backseats are usable for short trips, but not worth the sacrifice in the styling of this coupe.
