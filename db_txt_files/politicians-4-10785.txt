He didn't particularly do anything wrong during his tenure. In fact, he is a member of a small fraternity of presidents that have been elected to multiple terms (not that such is a prerequisite for greatness). Nonetheless, he never robbed Americans of their liberties or their Constitution. He oppossed Southern succession, but he (correctly) assumed that he didn't have any Constitutional right to prevent such action. While he doesn't deserve a full four stars, I will grant him this to counter the rather unfair lower ratings.
