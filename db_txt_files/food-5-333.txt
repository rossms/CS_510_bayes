For my money, the best of the minimalist cereals. I can eat bowl after bowl after bowl after bowl. I know what some users are talking about, though, with the little devils spilling out over the sides when you add milk. Guess I need a bigger bowl, but then I'd probably just fill THAT one up till ITS overflowing. The finest honey nut cereal variation out there.
