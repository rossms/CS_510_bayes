Rook perfectly balances luck and skill while allowing for many different strategies and play options. It is fun for four players and perfect for five. Six will work as well, but it can get unwieldy at that point. Good for families, so long as family members are patient with newbies (who frequently fluster their partners with frustrating mistakes).
