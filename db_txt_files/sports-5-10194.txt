Great coach. Lots of piling on going on by people who love to see the mighty fall. I guess people truly do hate greatness. Look at his overall record vs other great college coaches. His weakness is his offense. He needs a little less loyalty to offensive coordinators. Chuck Long really is offensive. No coach at Stoops' level can be great at the whole game. A new offense will put OU back on top. It is a rebuilding year, so all of you vituperative posters just stand by. Come back next year and read what you wrote.
