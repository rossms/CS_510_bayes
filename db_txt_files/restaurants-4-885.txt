I have never been a big fan of subs and regular sandwiches, but Subway has always offered my something of interest. Since I tend to favor hot sandwiches, I always get something heated (obviously) which usually means chicken. Though it would be better to have the meat warmed in an oven instead of a microwave, it is still good. More the enough toppings from which to choose allows for the service to tailor the sub to anyone's tastes (and the sandwiches are made right in front of you). As a side, Subway offers baked chips for a healthier option.
