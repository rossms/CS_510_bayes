I go nuts for that wonderful horseradish sauce that you dip the bloomin' oninon into. Wow, I could eat that by itself. I'd be tempted to go all the way to a five-star rating on this one, if it weren't for the long wait, the goofy Australian shtick (which feels soooo 1986 to me), and the most annoying radio jingle ever invented.
