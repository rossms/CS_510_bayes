Cingular is a great service thats very reliable. It has a variety of rate plans for different people with there different styles. One of the newest rate plans is 1000 anytime nationwide minutes with roll over for 39.99. For those who don't want a bill. Prepaid has three different plans. Unlike other services that only provide one. I use the 10cents anytime which charges 10cents for every minute. And chargets 1.00 fee everyday. Cingular.com will be the source of more information.
