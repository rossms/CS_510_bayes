A man of integrity and honor who votes with his conscience instead of his party affiliation. For those who criticized his decision to leave the GOP and think he should have resigned, I say you're all hypocrites. How come you weren't whining when Ben Nighthorse Campbell or Richard Shelby left the Democratic party to join the Republicans? Jeffords recognized what many with common sense have known for some time now...that the Republican party has changed for the worse since the election of Ronald Reagan.
