Pretty good place, I went there when I was like 12 or so and again when I was like 25. The difference between those trips - when I was 25, after going to Busch Gardens, I went to another world-famous Tampa attraction called Mons Venus. Now Mons Venus is only a juice bar, but those of you who know about it love that place. Busch Gardens in FLA is a fun place - interesting how they take the 'Dark Continent' theme so far and have a place to see exotic animals. Really good rides for people of all ages and a lot of water rides which is nice since it is in the warm climate of Florida.
