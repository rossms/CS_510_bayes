This is some of the best worm dirt on the market. The only problem is that it turned my lip into a piece of raw leather from dipping for years. Thank god I quit when I did cause I could literally see and feel the damage this stuff does! I chewed 1-2 cans a day for 10 years and quit with nicorette and determination. It has been a year now and my gums are slowing recovering. I don't mean to preach to anyone, but you are a fool if you continue using this! Your lip will fall off!
