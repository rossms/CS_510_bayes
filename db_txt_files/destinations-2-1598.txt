I honestly have nothing against the country of Israel, and respect their desire for survival. But, and I don't mean to generalize, hasn't the USA given Israel billions of dollars over the years to help them guarantee their security, yet we stole our own Native populations land from them? So much for favoring one groups soverinity over anothers. As another reviewer pointed out cleverly, my ancestors came from Europe in the early 1800's, their farmland stolen in a battle between Catholics and Protestants. I think they would just laugh at me if I went over now and demanded my ancestors farm back.
