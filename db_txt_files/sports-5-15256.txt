Brett's the toughest QB to ever play football, bar none. Who can argue with the consecutive games streak? Look at his numbers, a higher career completion rate then Marino 1 Super Bowl, 3 MVPs.. I mean the guy was unstoppable in his prime. He's not quite what he used to be, but I'd still take him over at least 26 teams starting QBs.
