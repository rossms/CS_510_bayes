In my younger days, I was a blue collar worker, and we couldn't smoke on the work-site. That was when the old-timers introduced me to the wonders of Copenhagen. I haven't used it in years, but it is harder to quit chewing than smoking. The first dip of the day or the first from a new can is superb!
