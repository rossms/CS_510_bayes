Not nearly as bad as the idiotic leftists want to think he is. He has done a great job with the economy considering he's had to deal with a recession in Clinton's term and 9/11. He stands up for christians being put down by leftists and he has helped education and medicare come along. However,he has his faults including a huge national debt and his lack of diplomacy, which hurts international opinion of him. Overall he has done a pretty good job with a country that had Clinton as president.
