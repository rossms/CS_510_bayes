Sorry, but its clear that Lucas is not good at expressing his characters emotions. When watching the film I always fast forward the tender scenes, which are torcherous and pathetic. It could of been much better. As for that S.O.B. Jar Jar Binks, I would suggest that Lucas remove him from the series, hopefully in a gruesome death in episode 3.
