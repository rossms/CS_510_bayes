The only Gamecube game I really enjoyed. Very long though. Used some tips and hints from the Internet. Still took me 2 months to beat and that's by playing an average of 3 hours per day. Like any addictive video games, can be very frustrating. But game difficulty level is about right - not too hard and not too easy.
