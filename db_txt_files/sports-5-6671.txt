Even up until several years ago, I wasn't very familiar with Phil, other than his track record of 6 NBA titles with the help of the greatest player ever, MJ. The Lakers were underachievers until Jackson took the helm. When he did, they won 3 straight and were in contention again this year. I've gained more understanding of him as a person, also. This guy is one of the geniuses in NBA history; possibly the greatest coach ever. His track record isn't accidental. He quells players' arguments and contentions, instills a confident frame of mind and brings players together. He's the real deal.
