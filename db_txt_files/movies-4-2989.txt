This may possibly be the prefect guys flick. It has everything a man could want, football, hot chicks, surfing, guns, action, Gary Busey, and ironically it was directed by a woman. Boy Keanu Reeves sure couldn't act his way out of a paper bag but you aren't looking for oscar caliber performances in this film anyway. Best Scene: Keanu diving out of a plane without a parachute. Totally unrealistic but totally fun.
