This sequel was much funnier than the original Meet the Parents movie. The first one lacked a compelling contrast or foil. Meet the Fockers more than made up for that one. Yeah there are many movies out there with a similar theme, probably because to an extent we can all relate. But Meet the Fockers takes a common topic and maximizes the contrasting and opposed natures of both families. Sexually repressed versus sexually open. Liberal anti-establishment versus conservative CIA agent. De Niro, as he usually does, pulled off an excellent performance here.
