Briles is doing a very good job with the talent he has. He had several key players not play due to grades. His offensive line lost two starters to the NFL [Hadnot: starter @ Miami & Bubba Evans: practice squad @ Texans] and a third to graduation. He had a true freshman and a true soph start on the OL. He lost his 1 and 2 receivers: Middleton and McCullars as well. Considering all this, he could have won a couple more games but he did a bang up job against Miami and Southern Miss
