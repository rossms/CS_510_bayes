i had a 98 rs wich i was going to fix up for show but then i got into a 2002 eclipse gt. its better looking then any other car out there it has been the #1 sold sports coupe for the past years. and for all u that think eclipse can be faster read or wait for the 4 gen. it supposed to have 470+ hp how about that.
