Hey, look! They have the same idiots over here as the do on the women's list. More sore winners voting for political opinion(which, last time I checked, was the root of democracy) rather than acting ability. Grow up and stop insisting everyone share your views people. We're all stupid about something or another. Paul Newman was great in Butch Cassidy The Sundance Kid. He was also great in The Hustler, Cool Hand Luke Cat On A Hot Tin Roof. Who gives a damn who the hell he(or anyone else) voted for.
