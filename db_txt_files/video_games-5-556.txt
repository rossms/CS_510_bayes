If you want an extreme challenge, get two Einsteins together and watch them struggle to overcome the other in this game. Chess is a great game-- all about strategy. People who are not strategy-inclined will sink faster than the Titanic if they put all their marbles out on the table. Bottom line: chess is great and squelches any other board game, with the exception of Monopoly.
