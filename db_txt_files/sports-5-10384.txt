c'mon folks. he has won 5 National Championships. only one current coach has more (Kehres, Mount Union College, D3, also in ohio). how can he not be considered 5 star?? if he isn't, who is 5 star?? he also has had great postive impact on every region he has ever coached in. just ask the folks of the youngstown area!
