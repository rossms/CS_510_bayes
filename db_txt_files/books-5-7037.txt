My favorite book of all time!! Ray Bradbury blew my mind away with the various tales of Martian Life. I love the way he used the 'Fall of the House of Usher' to create part of the story. I actually wrote him a letter praising this book (@ that time I was in the tenth grade and I didn't realize he was deceased). Any sci-fi or mystery fan should read this book.
