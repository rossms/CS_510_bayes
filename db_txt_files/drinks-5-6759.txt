I love this beverage!!!!! I have it every time I go into a starbucks!!!! I just have to say that somehow it tastes better on a wet, cold, rainy day when your in a bad mood it just lights up your day and that is such a good thing especially to the people around me. I'm so happy one of my girlfriends introduced it to me, now i'm vanilla lattes #1 fan!! I can't keep away from it, I tried something I used to like, but i just have to say Vanilla Lattes are my totally favorite! Maybe thats because i'm a total vanilla freak, but I don't know. THANKS SO MUCH FOR MAKING THIS BEVERAGE!!!!!!!
