I have to say - I used to view flying Continental as a fate worse than death -- but they have consistently been getting better every year. I did *NOT* appreciate the way they handled a flight being cancelled two years ago - but in fairness I probably wouldn't have appreciated the way ANY airline handled that situation. I'll keep flying them and hopefully it will keep getting better. I hope so because I fly out of Newark and since its a Continental hub - they usually have the best flights.
