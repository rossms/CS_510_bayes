I recommend this to all the business and travel types. Its nationwide coverage and free long distance are hard to beat if you're traveling a lot. Compared to other plans however, it does not give you as many free minutes. My big thing for you is that you should ask yourself if free nationwide roaming is more important to you than perhaps having more minutes for less cost. If you stay in the same place all the time and/or call in one particular area, I would suggest another company. Sprint seems to be the business network, not always the best family network.
