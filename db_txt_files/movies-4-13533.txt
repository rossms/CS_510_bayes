What an incredibly troubling movie. I didn't know whether to love it or to hate it. Kevin Spacey as Lester Burnham is the epitome of everything that's wrong with society ... and nobody could play it better. But, should you like the movie or not? Is it fair to be disturbed by the movie and still like it or not? Is it ok to love a movie that's about everything we should hate? Find out for yourself. You'll be glad you did.
