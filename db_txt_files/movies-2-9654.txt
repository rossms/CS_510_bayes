I love Jim Carrey...It's impossible for me to judge the film by his acting. I can judge it partly because of the acting, however. The movie...it was stupid, but he was good, so I'll give it a two..just because the movie survived even though it wasn't really comedy..just stupid comedy . Ofcourse, Jim Carrey can make ANYTHING work.
