Old No. 7 is a timeless classic. If you want shot and a beer or a mixed drink or just with a cube of ice, this is your whiskey. It has a mapleish smokey bite to it. By comparison Jim Beam (another excellent whiskey) is far sweeter. I don't usually go for the hard stuff, but when I do, Old No. 7 never disapoints.
