I recommend this to all the families out there. Pac Bell gives you cheap off-peak minutes, as long as you stay in their free calling circle. Most Pac Bell plans give you free statewide roaming, but if you leave that cheap area of calling, you will get charged a lot extra about $0.15 a minute for roaming, and $0.15 for long distance. There are plans to help cover a bigger long distance area, but that can sometimes be a little more than you expect. Again, this seems the best network for families. If you're receiving and placing calls around one major area, I recommend this service.
