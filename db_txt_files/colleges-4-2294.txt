As far as Ohio state schools go, the price is decent, and as long as you're in a math/science area, it's a decent school. *Not* the best place for liberal arts types. The campus is moderately easy to get around, and their wireless internet coverage is second to none. They also have a very well-known industrial/organizational psychology program at the graduate level.
