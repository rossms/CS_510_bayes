Connecticut has an envied quality of life that most states can only dream of. 'Ancient' cities and towns, great coastline and countryside, incredibly diverse, with much culture. In the many times I have been here, I have been impressed more and more. to AvalonMan96 I suggest you mature a bit- or better yet move to some hellholes in the deep south or perhaps live in pricey California. CT has a high quality of life- perhaps in the top five states in the country- I think you are too stupid/or young to see that- move to Oklahoma or Wyoming or Indiana- then you will meet 'stupid people'......
