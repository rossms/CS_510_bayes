Great, great book, second only to Lord of the Rings. It's even better than Ender's Game, although not by much. You would think it would be pretty boring to go over the same story again, although slightly different, but that's not the case at all--the story is completely different told from Bean's point of view and it's just as engrossing, if not more. The ending is also a lot more satisfying than the one in Ender's Game. An awesome science fiction book.
