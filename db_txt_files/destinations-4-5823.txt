For one, Wisconsin is in the Midwest, not the Northwest. Sure, Wisconsin may not be at the bottom of many lists, but to put that god forsaken state ahead of Minnesota in any poll or rating is a joke. There is no better state to live in besides MN. Hands down. Wisconsin may be able to hold our jockstrap, but some other states do not even get the chance. The only good thing to come out of Wisconsin is I-94W.
