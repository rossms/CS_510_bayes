The Civic remains a great little car in its latest iteration. Civics have always been fun to toss into a corner and still are, despite the phasing out of the previous Civic's independent front suspension for more conventional Mac Pherson struts. That aside, the Civic's engine remains sweet, smooth and eager to revv. The Civic is solid and well-built. Honda just keeps on churning out the winners while GM sits idly by. When's the next redesign of the Cavalier/Sunfire coming anyway?
