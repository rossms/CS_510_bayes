I think Taco bell is a great fast food place, but its one of the fewer fast food places that when you're done you're not quite filled up. Never the less it tastes awesome, I just think they should throw in another taco with your meal. I don't know about everyone else but when I go to a fast food restuarant I intend to leave with a full stomach. So you just don't get your money's worth with Taco Bell, but I'll continue to go there.
