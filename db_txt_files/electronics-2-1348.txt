My old boss has a PMP300. We all ohhed and ahhhed over it, and clearly these things are going to destroy the walkman, but this one isn't there yet. If you record at a bit rate that allows any kind of capacity, audio quality was lacking something, and it didn't come with enough RAM. Costs more, but I would only get one of these if you went with the PMP500
