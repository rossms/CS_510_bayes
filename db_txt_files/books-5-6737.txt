The absolutly perfect plending of two genre's: Sci-Fi and Comedy. I have practically memorized the forst book and have engaged in quote wars with other fans. Douglas Adams was trully a genius, and a great author. He will be sorely missed by all his fans!! I still carry a towel with me everywhere I go, and it has saved me on more than one occasion. They are currently (as of March 2004) making a movie out of the books. If anyone wishes to go into a deeper discussion of these books, leave me a private message. They are great!
