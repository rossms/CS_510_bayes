Be sure to go to the Cheesecake Factory on an empty stomach. The portions are gigantic, the selection is overwhelming, and the food is fresh and well-prepared. I recommend the Thai Lettuce Wraps, and the Tiramisu Cheesecake is to die for. My only gripe is that they don't serve regular iced tea (it's flavored).
