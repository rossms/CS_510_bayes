I have to agree with Al-Davis-Lives on this one. I thought the diary format of BJD made it a choppy read that came off to me as incessantly whiny. I must say that my dislike of the book did not stop me from seeing the film which I liked and would have seen regardless just for the wonder that is Colin Firth. I was glad when the film was released that it downplayed the diary aspect and focused on what were some really funny characters in hysterical and all too familiar situations.
