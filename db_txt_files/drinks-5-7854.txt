There is not another liquor that can be as diverse. There are a variety of specialities to suit a variety of tastes. There is Gentleman Jack for smooth, and Single-Barrel for flavor. Have a cocktail infused with Jack from their Country Cocktails. Or opt for a Jack-n-coke in bottle form. Plus there are the Gold Medal Decanter Series(can't beat 100yr old whiskey). So for any taste and any place there should always be Jack. My personal favorite is Jack with just enough Coke to give it color. ---THANK YOU Mr. Jack---
