Read them as a kid and loved the fantasy world and wonderful imagery. However, to all who have read them as a child, I highly suggest rereading them..totally new and different perspective. Kind of like walking into the old neighborhood and thinking that everything has shrunk, when it is you that has grown..Reread them!!
