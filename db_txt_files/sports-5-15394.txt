I've been looking at some of the comments under other QB's. I've even put comments under them. But, what I mainly see is the Peyton Haters. Sorry folks, but Manning is one of the best QB's in the league......much to your disappointment. He plays on a helluvateam, can throw the ball with accuracy. What more do you want??? A QB who can catch and run and block too??? If you overrate other QB's, and then immediately turn around and underrate Manning, well kissing Brady's and McNair's and McNabb's asses isn't going to be much better.
