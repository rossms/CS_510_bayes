Coulda been better, but definitely coulda been worse. And okay, I'll admit it...if it feature's Queen's music, it gets an automatic at-least-three rating from me. The plot was very interesting, and I liked how they combined pop culture with 14th-century jousting tournaments. The critics didn't particularly like it, but I never trust them. Pretty good movie, in my opinion. Take care, everyone!
