Outstanding, innovative and still unmatched, I think. Admittedly I struggled with the interface to begin with. Once you get used to it, it becomes intuitive. I used to play the old Starfleet Battles boardgame and I think this is the computer title that has inherited the best of the space fleet battle game traditions and matched it with an excellent graphics engine and engaging story. Can't wait for the next one.
