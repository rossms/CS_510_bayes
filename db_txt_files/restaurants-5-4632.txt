The problem with CPK is that everyone has a preconceived notion of what pizza is. This isn't Dominos or Pizza Hut. I'm from Boston where every place you go for pizza is at least good, but every where you go, pizza is different. The idea of CPK is to take pizza and give it unique and different toppings. They also make the best salads around.If I want a real Italian pizza, I go to Santarpios in East Boston or The Pizza Center in Winthrop, MA. CPK offers something different but wonderful.
