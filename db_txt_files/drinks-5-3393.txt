This was sooo addicting and loved it even more than chocolate shakes. Last time I tried to get one @ JJ I was told they don't make it anymore, so I don't go to JJ anymore. It was loaded with calories and the mid-sized serving was 700 calories or something, so it's a good thing it's not around any more.
