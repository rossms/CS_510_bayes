One of the all-time greats. Could hit for average (.325 lifetime, despite a post-World War II decline) and power (top season of 46 HR despite being a right-handed hitter in Yankee Stadium). Joltin' Joe is now in the position of being both overrated and underrated at the same time. He stopped being the greatest living ballplayer the instant Mays and Aaron joined the major leagues, but this shouldn't diminish the fact that he was, without a doubt, the greatest all-around player of his generation (Ted Williams was the greatest hitter, but was absolutely AWFUL defensively).
