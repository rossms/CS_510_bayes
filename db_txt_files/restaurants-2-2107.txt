If I were seeing those Quinzo's commercials with the distrubing little mutant gerbals and had never been to Quizno's, I wouldn't want to go. Being that I have eaten at Quizno's before, I can still say, I wouldn't go back. Their food is overpriced and doesn't taste very good. So, in that way, those commercials are a valid representation of what you will get at Quiznos. Something over the top and over rated.
