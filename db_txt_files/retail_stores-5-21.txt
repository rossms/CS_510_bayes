I have to give Barnes and Noble credit. It may be a national chain, but it preserves that certain sense of cozy charm you get at a local bookstore. I've often been impressed, too, that they tend to hire people who actually know books and authors, and are happy to make recommendations. The presence of a cafe is a nice touch as well, and the prices are good. It's a shame that some cute independent bookstores have to compete against gigantic bookstores like Barnes and Noble, but when they do this good a job selling and distributing books, it's a little hard to argue with their quality.
