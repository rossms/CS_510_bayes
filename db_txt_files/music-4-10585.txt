I had this tape and during my Elvis phase I probably learned all the lyrics to all the songs. Or maybe just all the lyrics to the songs that I really liked and would listen to over and over. Anyway, I listened to his Number One Hits a lot. Elvis sure is a talented fellow. I've found that songs like Love Me Tender that I couldn't get into back in the day are quite enjoyable now. But as for a lot of these songs, I don't know if I could enjoy them as much anymore. Maybe I'll dig deeper and find his TV special and the Sun Sessions to get some new material.
