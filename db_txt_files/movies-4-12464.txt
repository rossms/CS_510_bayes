A pretty interesting film from Tim Burton. It has a gothic feel to it,but nothing too scary for kids. I liked how the visuals looked. The story is about a young man named Victor, who is arranged to marry a yong woman named Victoria. On the day of the rehersal, he runs off into the woods and puts his ring on what looks like a branch. it turns out tobe a hand of a dead woman. soon, he discovers he married th corpse bride (Emily). There is too much information, but I thought it was a fun little story. The kids will like it and so will some adults.
