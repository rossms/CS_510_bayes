I would never presume to call myself an expert on rap and hip-hop (I would probably call this closer to reggae anway), but I have been listening to this CD at work (one of my co-workers brought it in) and I really like it. Wyclef does a good job of blending some original work and interesting remixes with an original and unique sound. I have even found myself singing along at different points in the CD, a definite indication that I enjoy listening to it. If you're not sure if you're ready to buy it, check out some tracks at Napster to see if you like it. I don't think you'll be disappointed.
