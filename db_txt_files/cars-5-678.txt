I have a Univega bike and I think it is great! It has been my mode of transportation since I was 15. This bike has never had any sort of defects or malfunctions like prior bikes I've owned. This bike series has comfortable seats and the gears on the bike are very easy to use. I love my bike and until I really need to get another one, I'll be riding my Univega.
