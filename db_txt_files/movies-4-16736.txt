Despite a slight distaste for the likes of Matt Damon I actually enjoyed this film. The acting was pretty good, entertaining plot line, beautiful setting etc. After seeing the film I picked up the book and enjoyed that as well and would recommend it as a good read. It's really easy reading and surprisingly well written. Of course Hollywood took their liberty with the original story line but overall I'd say they made it pretty entertaining and for once kept an ending that wasn't all sunshine and puppys.
