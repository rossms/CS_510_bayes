Another tremendous effort from Peter Jackson - the only reason I can't give it five stars is because of a couple of (probably) trivial deviations from the book. The battle scenes (and pre-battle) scenes are awesome, and Gollum / Smeagol is pretty much dead on. The kingdom of Rohan scenes were just as I had imagined from reading the book, and the horses, warriors, mountains, and landscape make for staggering scenery. The fact that one of my biggest complaints with the movie was that the Ents came to a hasty decision indicates that I probably should be giving this film five stars.
