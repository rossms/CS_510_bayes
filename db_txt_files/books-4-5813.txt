This was very exciting and very mysterious about a new lawyer who thought he was getting everything he ever wanted in being a lawyer and then found out he is being owned by the firm. He finds out the firms secret and then poof he is the next target to be hunted by his own firm. What a thrill to read but I was very dissapointed by the ending. The Movie ending is a whole lot better than the book ending.
