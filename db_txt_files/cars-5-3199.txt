There are so many Land Cruisers! I owned a Land Cruiser BJ 45 1982 model. A terrific vehicle that outmaled anything on the road until the Hummer came. Jeep Safari style but bigger and harder. A 4 cylinder 3,4 litre diesel that pulled and pulled and pulled. No frills whatsoever except that you could roll down the side windows. Of course you could fold down the wind shield. The present Land Cruiser 100 is different! An extremely competent vehicle with all luxury items on board except a foam bath. In between are a lot of models i would give three or maybe four stars.
