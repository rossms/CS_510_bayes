AWESOME! I've had mine since Christmas 2000 and will never watch TV the old way again! I watch what I want to watch, when I want to watch it, and skip all the commercials with the push of a button. I've checked out the competition, but they just don't stack up. If I want to watch one program and Tivo another, I can with just my standard cable hook up, and Tivo has this guide system that lets me tell it to record certain TYPES of programs, or movies with Christofer Walken, or WHATEVER! I love my Tivo, in case you can't tell.
