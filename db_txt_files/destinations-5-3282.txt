Was there for 10 days and it never rained once. Guess I was lucky! There's so much to experience here. Loved the Pike Place Market. The guys flinging the fresh fish around and chanting at the same time are worth the visit. A lot of traffic and streets that can be confusing. Loved the view of Mt. Rainier and the Olympic Mountains. Definitely would visit again!
