It seems like an all around nice state, the people are friendly, the summers are perfect, and it just seems like it would have been a great state to grow up in. I could live there, and i would like to visit some day. Milwaukee has the whole blue collar, traditonal, good old fashioned hard working people going for it too. You gotta respect it.
