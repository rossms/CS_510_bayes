Pretty good. A nice devotion to a mans former professor. Morrie was Mitch alboms favorite Professor in college. after seeing him on the news he gets in contact with him. Morrie is slowly dying from ALS. Every Tuesday Mitch flies to see his friend. Touchy book that has a sweet tribute to a man that was greatly admired by a former student.
