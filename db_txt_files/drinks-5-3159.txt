Some people enjoy the taste, others find it a bit bitter. I personally find the taste refreshing. I find that taking 4oz in the morning and 4oz in the afternoon gives maximum energy results thru out the day. On my bowling day I take 4oz 1 hour before and sip the rest while I bowl. My average has went from a 175 to 200! Not bad for an old gezer of 68.
