I consider Stouffer's to be the comfort food line. Stouffer's offers many dishes I remember from my childhood, including meatloaf, tuna casserole, chicken and noodles, and baked chicken. I think the meals are very tasty and satisfying, although they often contain sky-high amounts of fat. For that reason, I read the labels carefully and indulge only on occasion. If you're in the mood for something your mom used to make, look no further than the Stouffer's section at your grocery store.
