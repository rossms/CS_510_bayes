Dots... another candy with a funny name. They're chewy fruit-flavored candies, but not so sticky that they get stuck in your teeth. They come in lime, lemon, orange, strawberry, and the best, of course, cherry! The box even has a cute little Dot Dispenser , making it easy to just pour out one at a time from the box. This is as good as fruit-flavored candy gets!
