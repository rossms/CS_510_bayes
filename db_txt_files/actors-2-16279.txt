Unfortunately Maurice is a one trick pony. Every character he has played, from his stint on AMC to his portrayal of Desi Arnez, and especially Sonny on GH, has been only a slight variation of the same role. He shows little range (other than anger) and no versatility as an actor. After seeing the same character over and over, he's become too boring to watch.
