Kentucky Fried Chicken has the best chicken that I've ever eaten in my life, including other great ones such as biscuits, fries, and my personal favorite, Popcorn Chicken. I still call them by the full name, even though they are known as KFC due to the fried part in the name and/or it s better than saying Kentucky Fried Chicken.
