Well Cage rules, the only thing you'll be smoking with your Viper is your own wallet. You won't be smoking me any day cause your Viper's gonna be in the repair shop after a couple of spins while I'll be enjoying my trouble free Supra for years to come. I would not pay a cent over 10 grand for any Dodge or Chrysler product. I was talking about manouverability when parking by the way cause the Viper's so damn huge and not the actual act of parking itself! For heaven's sake, this is the company that gave us the K-Car. The K-CAR!
