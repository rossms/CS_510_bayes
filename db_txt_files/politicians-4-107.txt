I know he's as ugly as a mud fence, but I've always kind of liked this guy. When I was in junior high school, a girl flirted with me once and told me I looked like Prince Charles. I had no idea what he looked like, so was flattered to be compared with a prince (it wasn't often that a girl as attractive as she was would act interested in me). I did look up a picture of him at that point. Back then, he didn't look as homely as he does now. But then, neither did I.
