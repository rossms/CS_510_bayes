I don't need a degree. I wanted a degree because I wanted current thought-leadership in knowledge areas that would support my work as an executive. I am in my second year, my graduation year, at Capella. I travel 70% globally and leveraging Starbucks and hotel broadband worldwide I have been able to attend classes and establish working relationships with fellow learnersothers that are in my similar travel and business situation, sharing our ideas and cultivating our own learning organizations. Yes it is expensive since I take two courses per quarter-- but it's worth every penny.
