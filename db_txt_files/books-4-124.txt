The Autobiography of Malcolm X is a well written account of one of the most interesting figures on the landscape of post World War II America. Haley makes a sympathetic figure out of the often somewhat forbidding Malcolm. I could have appreciated a more detailed treatment of Malcolm's break with Elijah Muhammad and the apparent retreat from ethnic separatism at the end of his life.
