My 91 FXRP is my first big twin, after owning two Ironhead sportsters and plenty of metric bikes. I got it during the winter of 2003 and all there was to it was a set of wheels, front end, mangled front fender, engine, trans, primary, frame and swing arm. I replaced all the parts and got it running before springtime. It had 46k on the clock and now has 48 1/2K on it. It runs fast and strong and rides like a dream. Its quick when I wanna go fast, and comfortable when I wanna relax and cruise. I would get on this bike and ride it cross country on a moments notice if I needed to.
