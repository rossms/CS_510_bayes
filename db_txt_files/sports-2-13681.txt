Only reason he was even considered a good coach was because he had good, or even great players, in GB. Now since he has total control of Seattle his real coaching skills are coming out. He sucks like and old cranky dad does. Yelling at your players which are now adults doesn't gain you respect. Seattle will not succeed till they drop him and get a even tempered and more intelligent coach, gm. Reminds me of Billy Knight with his in your face temper tantrums. How can you thrive in a system with a tyrant as your leader.
