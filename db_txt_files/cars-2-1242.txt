I really regret to buy this crappy car. I was deceived by its looking at the first glance and didn't look anywhere. Four tires were replaced after 20k miles. Rattled from the first day. Can not slide the left window in the front. Lights inside can not be on or off with the closing or opening of the doors. I will never buy a Nissan again.
