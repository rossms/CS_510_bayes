Nice little car and can go and go for a long time, but I can't go with 5 stars with this one. It is still a small budget car and anything small looks kinda cheap to me with the little skinny 12 inch tires, but the price tag is nice and a good car for a college student. If you really want to do it up spend more and treat yourself to a Nissan Altima.
