Doesn't the same company own Banana Republic, the Gap, and Old Navy? It makes sense, I guess. When you're pre-teen and you want basic clothes, you go to Old Navy. High school or college comes around and you graduate to the gap. Get a real job and you're forced to step up to Banana Republic. It all seems a little pre-programmed, and yet I'm still falling for it. Is there something wrong with me?
