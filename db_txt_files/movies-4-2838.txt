Lots of violence but good. We always like David and Goliath films. The Warriors are from Coney Island and go all the way to the Bronx to a gang meeting. A gang Napoleon is going to unite all the gangs in the Big Apple and take over. Some nudniks assassinate the potential leader and then blame the Warriors. The Warriors must fight their way back to Coney though a myriad of opponent gangs whipped up by a gang moll on the radio directing traffic by trying to get the Warriors wiped out. Maybe Cowboy and Indian is a better description of this movie than David and Goliath.
