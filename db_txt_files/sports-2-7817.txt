Witout MJ, Scottie Pippen is changing my oil at Jiffy Lube. Is there a more unreliable 'superstar' when there's a game you desperately need? In his prime, a highly athletic forward- but he just could not seem to shake the 'whiny bitch' label he carried throughout his career. . .justified or not. He had post-Jordan opportunites and blew them all. Rumors and smoke tell us that Pippen is a bad teammate.
