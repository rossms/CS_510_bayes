There is no place on earth like Tiger Stadium on a Saturday Night. When the Golden Band from Tigerland comes out from the South End Zone and does the Stadium Salute playing Pre-Game, it is the essence of what college football is all about. There is nothing like it with the crowd standing and yelling at the top of their lungs! GEAUX TIGERS!!!!!
