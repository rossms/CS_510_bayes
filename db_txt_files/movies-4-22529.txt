enjoy the books of robert e howard although the story was a bit wrong conans parents werent killed and conan was never a slave for very long. Also i though arnold was too good looking to play cocan most pics ive seen of conan he wasnt that good looking i still ebnnjoyed this flick although the 2nd film was much much better.Also note conan was a blue eyed barbarian of old atlantian stock
