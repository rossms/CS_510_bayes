He was good in North Dallas 40 and 48 Hours, but the rest of his performances were pretty wan. I Love Trouble in which he co-starred with the World's Worst Actress, Julia Seabiscuit Roberts, was one of the worst films of all time. Dreadful in New York Stories, in which Rosanna Arquette acted rings around him. And Jefferson in Paris was tripe. Affliction is supposed to be his best role, but this guy so under-impresses me that I refuse to spend $10 to see anything he's in. Maybe I'll rent the video...
