This is a very entertaining movie. I did find that it was missing a lot of what made the original so interesting. It seemed to lack the satirical look at society and left out the comments of our ways of life. Replacing them with great effects and lots of fighting. It was a great movie though. I just have one question... Can anyone explain to me that ending?????
