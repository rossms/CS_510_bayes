This series was incredible. Tough to read for kids these days, because of the vernacular and so many kids don't read a lot. But its worth the effort, and, just like in the Harry Potter books, once a kid gets used to the language use, their reading skills are really sharpened, and the increase in the speed w/which they read is phenomenal! HIGHLY recommended.
