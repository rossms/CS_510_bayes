FDR was a great president and thats all there is to it. Theres no doubt his programs were rather socialist, but if ever working with a large amount of people, you will find that someone needs to take charge. People in a society look to a leader for guidance rather than looking for themselves. Its easier to listen to someone who tells you how to do something, rather than have to take the time yourself to figure it out. FDR was an excellent leader... this is because he knew how to lead... and he was just an excellent fit as the United States President considering the circumstances surrounding the times.
