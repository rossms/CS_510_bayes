i'm 16 and have been chewen grizzly longcut wintergreen for quite a while, its the best quality for your money, but i've found myself growing tired of it, i mean it really doesnt pack much of a punch if your really used to it, recently i've started chewin copenhagen long cut, and i admit i get more satisfication out of it, but the stuff is too expensive, i gotta say that grizzly is the best buy out there, decent quality, and cheap
