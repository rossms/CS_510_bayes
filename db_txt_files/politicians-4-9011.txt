A flawed leader who was neverthess infinitely preferable to the alternative. His flaws were no worse than most of the egotistical headcases that seek high office, though -- he was less skillful at hiding them, but that was probably tied in with his amazing ability to connect with people. A moderately effective President and a brilliant, messy, well-meaning man who doesn't deserve half the calumny that's been heaped on him.
