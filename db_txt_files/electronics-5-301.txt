Panasonic make the best cordless phones. I have a 2.4 Gig Panasonic with answering machine. Now the features and performance, Water proof, shock resistance, clear all the time, can go twice as far as other 900mhz cordless phones. I paid $199.99 for this phone back in 1998, still works like a dream, well worth the money, Panasonic go.
