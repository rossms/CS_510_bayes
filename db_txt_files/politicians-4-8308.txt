I was in my late teens and earley twenties when President Reagan was in the White House. I was't Conservative or Liberal. I had no knowledge of politics, I didn't need to. I did know one thing, he made me feel proud to be an American. Was Reagan perfect, of course not. He did what all presidents do, stand on there principles and do what they feel is right for the country. People need to respect the office of President no matter who is in there. All things considered, We've got it pretty damm good, and that started with Reagan.
