Cadbury Mini Eggs ranks high on my list of favourite candies and chocolates. They consist of a crisp candy outer shell encasing solid milk chocolate which is simply addictive. I can't stop eating these! It's too bad though that Cadbury only sells Mini Eggs around Easter time, afterwards they disappear from store shelves until the following Easter.
