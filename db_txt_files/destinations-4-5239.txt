Cakifornia is still the Mecca- but the reasons for it being a 'Mecca' are fading. Why? Overcrowding, silly housing costs, traffic, and a jaded view by its residents of its so called vaunted 'superiority'. Sure it has a great climate, with limitless recreation opportunites- but to survive there, you must be rich, or moved ther 15-20 years ago. Too 'liberal' not really- tolerant YES! And one thing California has going for it is it being Liberal- and in a new global order- that will be very important- The same can be said of the Northeast- lacking the sun and mild weather.
