Don't buy this product. I purchased a PC with more than adequate RAM, hard drive storage and basically every thing required to process video. Pinnacle is an easy program to learn and use, but it doesn't work. It locks up, loses video and audio clips and is very slooow. It's cheap, but don't waste your money.
