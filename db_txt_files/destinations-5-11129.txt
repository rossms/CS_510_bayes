Ocean City is a fantastic place to visit. It's boardwalk ahs everything and is very family friendly. Yet it has a great adult life as well. Maybe the best bar/night club is on 49th street called Seacrets. it is a must go to for anyone looking for a sensational night out. Heading there in just a matter of days to have another go around. Ocean City like any beach has it's hang ups like traffic but it is a great place to go to.
