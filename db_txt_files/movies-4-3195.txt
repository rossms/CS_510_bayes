I give this 4 stars because it is first-rate entertainment. If you know that you're being completely bull-sh**ed, then it is one hell of a ride. Not really based on a true story, for it's patriotism is so great (whad'ya expect?), it is still a well-crafted, breath-taking film. I suggest it to anyone who won't believe it. Summary: A BREATH-TAKING AND VERY PATRIOTICAL FILM NOT TO BE TAKEN SERIOUSLY.
