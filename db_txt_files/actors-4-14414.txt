As an amateur impressionist, I make it a hobby to study vocal intonation. Usually I do this with men because it is easier for me to emulate, but I also like to study regional accents. These are very interesting and very difficult to reproduce for many actors (even with coaching). Lohan amazed me with her flawless British accent in Parent trap. I would never have thought anybody could do that at such a young age. Since then, I have not been greatly impressed with her acting, music or her looks, despite what everybody else says. Even so, I still have to give her props for that awesome accent.
