This movie was good! I loved the powerful girl part, but found some parts unrealistic, and phoney, as well as the stunts. It also couldn't beat the classic 70's T.V. show, but I don't know if Drew Barrymore, Cameron, and Lucy Liu could've done it any better. All in all, it wasn't the best, but very entertaining!
