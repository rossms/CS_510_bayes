I am not a huge fan of chocolate cereals. My husband and sons love it, because it turns the milk to chocolate and then they can drink the milk (what is it about breakfast cereal that makes everyone act juvenille?) Anyway, besides the chocolate factor, Pebbles are too darn small. They get soggy before you even stop pouring the milk. By the bottom of the bowl, all of the chocolate has mixed with the milk, and you are left with little, pale, chewy flakes..yuk.
