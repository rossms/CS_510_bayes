The most beautiful state in the Union. Camping, fishing, climbing, snowboarding, 4WD trails, biking, hiking, and all around indescribable scenery make Colorado the Promised Land. Anyone who has ever made the trip from Silverton to Ouray along US 550 knows what I'm talking about. And Colorado Springs is the most inviting city I have ever had the pleasure to visit. Now, if only the Texans and granola heads would stay out.
