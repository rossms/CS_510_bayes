Some people I talk to have said that From the Corner of His Eye is too sugar coated to be really fine. It IS a more positive relationship type book than Koontz has often written, but I didn't find it sugar coated at all. I thought the occassional touches of sweetness in the book were handled well and I personally enjoyed them.
