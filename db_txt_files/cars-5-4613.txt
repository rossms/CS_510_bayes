I have 98' reg. xe and 34,000 trouble free miles. It has been a great truck. It has plenty of power, the ride is smooth, and an overall fun truck to drive. Added a catback exhaust and K N air filter and has a better pick up. Feels like it has more power. Use it as a daily commuter and the bed comes in handy when needed. Average about 26 mpg.
