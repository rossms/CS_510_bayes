Purchased our Grand Cravan a year ago, and it drives very smoothly. We shoped around and could not find another minivan that drove as well with all the features we were looking for. Built in child seat are real handy! Long Trips to cottage country are very comfortable, and with all the storage room no need to leave any extras behind. Also fits a 4x8 sheet of plywood nicely.
