Are you kidding? The Chiefs are one of the most well-rounded teams in the country right now. Their offense, defense, and special teams are working hard every game and it shows. The only team to beat them so far are the up-and-coming Bengals, and the coast seems to be relatively clear from here on out. They seem to be destined to win the Super Bowl this year, and it couldn't happen to a nicer bunch of guys. Go Chiefs!
