One of the best cities in the country. Not only is it historic, but as property values rise in New York, artists are moving to Philly adding to the cultural wealth that the city revels in. Many bad mouth Philly as, well, unfriendly, but that is totally untrue; people are just very honest. The only downside to Philly is its wealth of ghettos which are slowly turning around. The fifth largest city (second on the east coast) is really a an amazing place.
