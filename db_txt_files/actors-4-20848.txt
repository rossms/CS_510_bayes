Like Holly Marie Combs you guys don't give a lot of live to these talented celebrities. Tea Leoni is very talented plus she is cute. The Naked Truth although it lasted only two sseasons I believe, it was still a hilarious comedic show. Also Deep Impact went on my top ten list the year that came out and The Family Man was the only good family-friendly Christmas movie of the year. It was also a worthy remake of It's a Wonderful Life. Show some compassion like I am with Tea so, Ms. Leoni, you got my vote.
