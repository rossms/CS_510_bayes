Finally!! Some respect for the White Sox!! Although I live in South Carolina, I still hear local sports radio personalities talking about how well the White Sox played with the perfect "TEAM" method and how their teamwork, sans one or two megastars, has set the benchmark for how the other MLB teams should consider their own team makeup and chemistry. Very interesting. You know they've made a serious impact in sports when the smallest Southern state is talking about a Chicago team. Go Go Sox!!
