What was Travolta thinking?! How could you possibly do an 1100 plus page book justice in a 2 hour movie? If that's not bad enough, Travolta as a big mean alien is just pathetic. Don't get me wrong, I think Travolta is a great actor, but no way could he pull this one off. See this one only if you're dragged kicking and screaming by a catlike alien named Terl.
