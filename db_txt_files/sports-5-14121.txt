Joe Montana was the best quarterback in the NFL, until he went to the Kansas City Chiefs, but when he was on the 49ers he was the best, able to roll to the right and catch Jerry Rice on the slant. Whenever the 49ers were down in the 4th quarter you didn't have to worry, Joe the Comeback Kid Montana would win it for them.
