Schaefer is the...one beer to have when you're having more than one. That's how the radio ads used to go back in the early 70's. I remember that Schaefer smell, upper decks of Shea Stadium early 70's going to Jets vs Patriots games. I have a fond nostalgia for this beer, even if it isnt very good. I swear, when I was in college I drank 18 of these in one night. It was like water. 18 was a lot of beers for me and I still wonder if that was really the number, but it certainly was Schaefer.
