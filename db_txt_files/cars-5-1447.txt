I just got a Volvo S60 last week and it's a great car! It is solidly constructed. The Volvo handles very well on the road; it's very aerodynamic. The designers of the car made it so that every bit of space is utilized; making it very practical. Also, the design of the car is very stylish; it looks like a sports car, yet it handles like a luxury vehicle. I usually drive American made cars, but I think that the Europeans make the best automobles.
