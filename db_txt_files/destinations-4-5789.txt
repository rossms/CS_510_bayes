if i where to move back south, this would be my destination. i lived there for 5 years, and i have to say it was the best 5 years of my life. its like a peice of the north welded onto the deep south, a place where us yankees outnumber the native hicks 2-1, and therefore its a bit more tolerant than all of its neighbors, and every other southern state for that matter. (although they do have a :GAG: :WRETCH: bush in the govenors seat, gimmie lawton chiles anyday!) only drawbacks are lots of old people and the sh*tty way they drive. oh, and most of the population of miami too.
