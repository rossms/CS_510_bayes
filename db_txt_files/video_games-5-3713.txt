My brother actually owns this game, but it is truly addictive! I started playing it and was confused at first, trying to figure out how to use all the controls. But once I got the hang of it, I never wanted to put the thing down. It is very realistic, which the bad guys jumping around corners and scaring you and dogs snapping at your face. It's very violent, though, so I'm not sure why it's only rated for teens. It gets pretty intense and graphic at times.
