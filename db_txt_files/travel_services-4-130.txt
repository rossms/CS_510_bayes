Compared to some major Airlines Virgin isn't that bad. How many airlines allow you to play games, have decent in-flight food, constantly fill your glass with a different range of drinks instead of water and juice and have a decent selection of the latest film realeases? Not to mention good air-conditioning. I found Virgin to be friendly and the price of my ticket decent. I would definitely use them again.
