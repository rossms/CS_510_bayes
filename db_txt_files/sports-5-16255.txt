My kind of guy. The Bills should have kept him instead of Rob Peanut Brittle Johnson. Granted, Flutie isn't the sole reason San Diego's been successful, but I'll take him for his leadership and his ability to be liked by (almost) all of the segments of the local populace. Hey, San Diegans, enjoy this guy while you can. Despite the local antics of our talk shows here in Buffalo, people loved this man. What he gave to Buffalo and Western New York was immeasurable. A class guy and a real human being.
