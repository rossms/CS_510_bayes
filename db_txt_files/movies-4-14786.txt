We just rented this and I found this to be a good movie. A mother and daughter move to a small town in France and set up a chocolate shop. For a good part of the movie they deal with the opinionated townspeople who are influenced by the church to not except these new people. Very slowly Vianne makes friends and helps to change this town for the better. I like the message at the end about acceptance and not passing judgement on others .
