The most historic city in the Western world. It can't be beat for history and is very beautiful and I found easy to get around in. The only bad part of any of my trips there, was a pigeon pooped on my head at the train station during my very first trip...LOL! I got off the train, looked around, said in a loud voice I can't believe i'm in Rome, and then splat! Fortunately, I had a hat in my backpack...LOL!
