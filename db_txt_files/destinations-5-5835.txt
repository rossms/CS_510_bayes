Absolutely beautiful in the spring and fall. Especially if you get a chance to see the countryside. Winters suck but they have the equipment to remove all the snow; unlike those dumbass crackheads in Indiana. The people are very friendly and there is lots to do in the cities of Milwaukee and Madison. I truly miss living in Wisconsin.
