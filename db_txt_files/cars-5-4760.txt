Had a 2500 HD with 8.1 engine, 4X4 Pulled a 7200 lb 5th wheel with it. VERY GOOD TRUCK. Enough power to pull two 5th wheels. Never bogged down, always power to spare. Excellent brakes. 12 MPG pulling or not pulling. All the bells and whistles. Everything worked fine. Like sitting in your living room. Almost cried when I sold it. Would buy another in a heart beat.
