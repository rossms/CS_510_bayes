Just watched this one a couple of nights ago, and I have to admit it was pretty funny. You never know what kind of outlandish ideas the Coen Bros. are gonna come up with, and that's part of what makes their movies so entertaining. I knew it was gonna be good when I saw the dude write a check for 69 cents to pay for some half and half.
