I thought this book truly bares the soul of climbing.Jon Krakauer is a great writer and I love his books. I don't understand why some people have gotten so angry at what he has written. He told the reader all that happened, and gave his feelings about it all. And there is absolutely nothing wrong with that. If you don't like someone's writing, don't read their work. Don't criticize them for something that others enjoy.
