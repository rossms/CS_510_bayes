This is an excellent museum. I'm not really a museum person so had not made it a priority to go see it. It was fascinating and extremely well done. The displays are very well designed and the staff friendly and well-informed. The prices are reasonable, from tickets to gift shop and consessions. I would strongly recommend it to anyone.
