We're new to the RAV4 experience, but our 2001 2wd L model amazes us daily with its ... styling, comfort, ride, handling, mileage, fit finish, quietness, etc. In fact, our only complaint is that the intermittent wipers only have one speed. That's it. A great little car that deserves to be compared against its competition withing its market segment. NOT SUV behemoths like Tahoes Explorers. Both types of vehicles have their merits, but direct comparisons are like apples to oranges. Best Regards, Archie R. Houston, TX http://lonestar.texas.net/'arch/ mailto:arch@texas.net
