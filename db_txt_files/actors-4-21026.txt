Probably only known for her roles on Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Angel, Charisma Carpenter is one of those actresses that I wish hadn't gotten potholed. She has undeniable flair for one-liners, sarcasm and can deliver any line like it's nobody's business. Unfortunately since the demise of both shows, I fear many TV movies ahead in her career. I'd like to see this beautiful actress gain some real credibility.
