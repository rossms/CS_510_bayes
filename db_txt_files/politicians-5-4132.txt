I have voted for Nader twice for President. So did several of my friends. So many people said to us, A vote for Nader is a wasted vote. Really? So these people really wanted my friends and I to vote for our second choice--George W. Bush? I was a member of the Democrat party for many years, but am now an Independent. I will never again vote Democrat!!! I am disgusted with the party and its candidates. I will rarely if ever vote Republican--unless perhaps it is John McCain.
