Mike, anybody that listens to the completely mindless, identical bubblegum crap needs violence done to them. Anyway, this is by far Manson's best work. The storyline has so much depth- From the rise of the Worm to Antichrist Superstar ascendant to his eventual fall. This fits right in with Mechanical Animals, as it's the dual opposite of that album. About Cooper: I love the guy, but his songs were about one thing- Sex. He had nowhere NEAR the depth of Manson. Besides, he became a Fundie ages ago.
