This is one of the best museums in the world. It has an excellent collection of artifacts, including the Isle of Lewis Chessmen and Rosetta Stone. You could easily spend a full week here and still not see everything. They are open almost every day of the year, except Christmas, New Years, and a few days around Easter. This is a must.
