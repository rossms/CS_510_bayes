Oh my gosh, Swiss cheese is simply out of this world! With me, Swiss is number one! It's great with crackers as a light snack, and a great accent to Sizzler's Malibu Chicken. Other than that, I prefer to eat Swiss cheese by itself. And, no... processed swiss cheese won't do. It has got to be pure and real, or I won't have much to do with it.
