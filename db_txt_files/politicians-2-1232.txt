may G-d forgive them for sending their children to die. Chairman Arafat should look into the life of Mahatma Gahndi. Amazing how people forget history, the Palestinians were given a state, they destroyed it themselves. And yes the Israelis were no angels either. The Arabs lost the wars, do they want to keep up the bloodletting forever in search of what they can't get. My hope is a Palestinian State and a very succesful one and an Isreal that can live in security. If this can't be resolved I see no hope for the human race.
