Mine's a '95 & just turned 250,000 miles. Do I really have to say any more? No, I didn't spend a ton on repairs. The one big thing was a head gasket at 120,000. Ironically, the older it gets, the less it seems to need, repair-wise, and it's getting better mileage than ever... about 20-21 MPG highway. A few spots of rust, mainly around the tailgate where I'll take the blame for leaving the back window down through several rains like a dummy. The tires last me about 100,000 miles per set. Life is good.
