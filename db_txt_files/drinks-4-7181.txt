Will you Americans stop the childish act with regards to the French. You would have lost your war of independence if it wasn't for the French Navy! Get over it! I am tired of you scapegoating them. they march to their own drum and that pisses off your stupid president! That all said, Grey is a smooth vodka. FYI - vodka is Polish and not Russian. I recommend a good Polish potato vodka.
