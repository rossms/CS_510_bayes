dizzy up the girl is an excellent album... it was unlike any album yet released by the goos, they had fully gone mainstream (other than robby's up-beat punk songs that keep the album still sounding like the old goo in some sense) it contained the incredible single iris written by johnny for the city of angels soundtrack. it also contained the chart toppers slide, broadway, and black balloon. each song is distinct and all the songs are excellent peices of music.
