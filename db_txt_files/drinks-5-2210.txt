A smooth, unsweetened green tea. Not very bitter, as green teas go - a plus, in my book. As the name implies, this stuff is pure, containing only: purified water, green tea, and Vitamin C (as a preservative, I assume). This style of beverage is fairly common, in Japan. Kudos to Ito En, for marketing it in the US!
