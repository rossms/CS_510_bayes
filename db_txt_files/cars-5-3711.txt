The QX4 rocks. It's tough, well-built and is an exceptional value. It's certainly more prestigious and desirable than your run of the mill, plain jane, dime a dozen Explorer/Cherokee/Blazer monsters. The QX4 exudes an aura of style and refinement not found in its inferior domestic counterparts. Great job Nissan and Infiniti, keep the domestics on their toes while they continue to lose market share!
