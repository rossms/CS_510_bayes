I think that you are a very good Baseball player..actually one of the best ones...well you and Derek Jeter!...So you had a shaky season in 2004...so what? You know I've read a lot of books on you, and know a lot, and know that you can do well on the Yankees and that you derserve to be on the Yankees no matter what people say. You just got to belive and you got me to belive in you, too!
