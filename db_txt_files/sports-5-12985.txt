Dennis Erickson has OSU playing great football, on offense, defense, and special team. They are very focused, they overcome mistakes, they play thru bad calls, they are playing with a minimum of injuries, and they get fortunate every now and then. It is great fun watching....If OSU makes it thru Cal and Az the Civil War game will be one to remember. GO BEAVERS
