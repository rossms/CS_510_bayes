i think that this book is excellent, however, i am a little worried that it might not be appropriate for reading out loud to very young children. The greatest thing about HP books is that the characters age with the audience, so it a book more focused towards the early teens. It's a great story line and brings so much more to the HP saga. kids learn that friendships aren't always easy, that rivalries can be overcome and that even the underdog can prove himself. I just wish that other major characters would be fleshed out a little more in this book, rather than just acting in Harry's periphreal vision.
