With a fairly silly plot that seems curiously derivative of the one in the film Total Recall Red Faction is nonetheless a very enjoyable FPS and one that spawned the Geo-mod engine which basically allows you to blow up scenery, though this is excellent in that it makes your surroundings look genuinely war-torn following a battle it doesn't have a major strategic effect on the game like it should have. The gameplay is fairly repetitive but with that said this is probably a good thing considering most of this game is the marginally entertaining task of blasting through cannon fodder.
