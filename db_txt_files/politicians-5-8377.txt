Reagan won the Cold War. He did it without firing a single shot and did not lose any Americans while doing so. When Qaddafit acted up in the mid eightes, Reagan quickly stepped out and bombed his regime. Qaddafi hasn't said a word since. I was barely alive when he was in power, but I know he had the support of most Americans. I viewed his final speech while President, and it was probably one of the best speeches Ive seen. Rest in peace, Ronnie.
