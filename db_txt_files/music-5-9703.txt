What a voice! Rob Thomas as always is a delight to listen too. The songs are really meaningful and it is one of my few cds that you can never get tired of. How else can you explain why it stayed in the charts so long. Push is now a greatly loved classic and their new albulm Mad Season is equally brilliant
