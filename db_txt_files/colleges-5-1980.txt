Clemson University was one of the most fulfilling experiences of my life. I gained a world of knowledge, met wonderful people, and experienced some of life's greatest moments. I wouldn't trade one minute of my time there and I only wish that I could have stayed there longer. College is one of the singlemost important experiences of a yound persons life and Clemson is a perfect place to experience it.
