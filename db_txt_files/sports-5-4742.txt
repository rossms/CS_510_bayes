A great Hall Of Fame coach who is losing it a bit ( kinda like JoePa). Over his career he's done great things with underrated teams. He's an unothodox coach with a unique style and personality, but he means well and has meant a lot to Temple University. I wish him the best and hope he starts winning more often.
