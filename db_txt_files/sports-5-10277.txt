What Coach Stoops has done for the University of Oklahoma football program is phenomenal! He has embraced the Sooner tradition that was lacking after Switzer left. He LOVES it at OU and we're proud to say he's OUR coach. I think his record is 42-9 over the last four years--pretty remarkable considering what he inherited when he came here. Now, once again, the Sooner Nation has a team they can once again be proud of. Can't wait to go to the Sugar Bowl in 2004! P.S. RealSooner must be a RealLonghorn
