Caramello used to be my favorite candy for a brief period of time. It might have been while I was trying to be sophisticated because this candy bar is fancy. The chocolate is good but very thick as it covers a very sweet, very liquidy carmel. I still think Caramellos are good but they are really really sweet. You have something to drink if you eat one because you get so thristy.
