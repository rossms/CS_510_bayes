Pizza Hut has a great, excellent salad bar and thier breadsticks are awesome, but their Pizza is another story. It's really good, but you have to get the right toppings, or you'll have a pretty bad night. Eating this pizza with only cheese is too yucky, as the crust is one inch thick. You need to have at least 2 meats on the pizza to be able to inhale it.
