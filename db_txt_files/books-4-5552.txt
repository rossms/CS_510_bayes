This book was pretty good. I would say it is an above average read - interesting characters and plot. I first read it maybe five years ago and really enjoyed it - and then re-read it a couple of years ago and was less impressed. This book won't be a classic - in fact it seems to aspire to be the new A Separate Peace . It just doesn't quite get there. Still, worth picking up a copy.
