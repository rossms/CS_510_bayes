Chris Cornell's first solo venture spotlights his truly diverse musical talent. On Euphoria Morning, he writes his trademark cryptic lyrics as well as stripped down exposed ones, and uses his most amazing, ranged, unique voice as the main instrument. Mission and Preaching the End of the World are two tracks with a completely different feel (hard rockin' vs. slow paced ballad) that show Chris Cornell is truly one of the best modern musicians out there.
