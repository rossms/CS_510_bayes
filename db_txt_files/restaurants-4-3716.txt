Great for late night food but what is it about this pizza that enables the average eater to consume about 3 times as many slices? I guess it's thinner than normal pizza but whatever it is you can really put these slices away. Not my favorite overall but consistent and that's good to know when you're someplace where you're not familiar with the local pizzerias.
