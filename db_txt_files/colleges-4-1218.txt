Penn is a very good Ivy League school, one of the better ones of the Eight Ivies. It should probably be called Wharton University because , to be honest, outside of the Northeast, when people hear the name Penn they think of Joe Paterno and Penn State and educated people first think of The Wharton school of Business.
