I love this school. Like any school it has its weaknesses (school spirit). But the campus, faculty, and students make up for it. It's location is perfect being in Atlanta but far enough away from the bustling city if you need some peace. The buildings are gorgeous and there is a great social scene. There is something for everyone at this school. I never thought that I could find such a different group of people who get along so well together. I came in knowing no one and will leave with the greatest of friends.
