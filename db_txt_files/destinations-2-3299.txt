Hmmmm, with this city being run by liberal democrats for the last 60 years, why is there such poverty? I thought liberals and the left wing idealism built a utopia where all people are equal and there's no racism or poverty. It seems that the Democratic Party and its rhetoric about the Republicans is nothing more than empty promises and phony beliefs.
