How can you not love cream cheese? Of course it's not good by itself, but how can anyone eat a bagel without it? Cream cheese is also the main ingredient in cheesecake...yummy. I put an extra packet in my cheesecake to make it extra delish. It's great on a cracker or toast with tomatoes and fresh basil. That strawberry spreadable kind is pretty yummy too.
