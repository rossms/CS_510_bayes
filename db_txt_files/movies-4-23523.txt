one of the best superhero movies ever made. I found this tobe much improved over the first movie. In this film, Peter Parker (AKA SpiderMan) Is in college and has his own apartment. His new enemy is Doc Ock who has metal claws. it's up to spiderman to stop the menace. I am making the plot short because it's complex. this film can be for all comic book fans or for people who like good action and a good story.
