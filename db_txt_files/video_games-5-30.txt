Great action game. Although the scenario is a bit too futuristic for a medieval-based game, it still rocks, with great graphics, environnement and sound. This game is really intelligent, based on sneaking rather spilling blood. It changes from the Kill-destroy-butcher-eviscerate and exploding games. But Thief2 require quite a lot of patience and brain to play. See the Thief-The Dark Project rating also.
