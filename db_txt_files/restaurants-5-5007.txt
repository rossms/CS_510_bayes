I have been working as a server/bartender @ Olive Garden for about 3 years now ...the food is not microwaved and never recooked .If a guest has a problem with the food we just make it again .I have to say that it is one of the CLEANEST restaurants i have ever worked at ,i have worked at a few ....so what im saying is Olive Garden is not the place u guys should worry about try some Brinker stores those would really scare you =)
