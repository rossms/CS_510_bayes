My favorite cd of all time. It has outstanding sound quality. The songs areclassic, and played with much more energy than on the studio versions(which aint half bad either) They have the right blend of musicianship, tone, conviction, energy, and charisma, all played at violatingly loud volumes. And one of the best parts: NO DISCO!
