I am a huge fan of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, and obviously of Sherlock Holmes. The cases also have me guessing until the end. I also love how Dr. Watson is such a great character-the lovable, agreeable sidekick who never seems to know what's going on. And how Holmes is the cold,unfeeling genius who you can't help but adore.
