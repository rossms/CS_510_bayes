bought a 96 disco se7, with only 90,000 miles on it. two shops have now said that is leaking oil from every single orifice. just like that. land rover dealership wants nothing to do with it, wanted me to wait ten days to squeeze me in, mean while i have an oilfield in my driveway. my mechanic told me there was no way landrover could have missed when they did the oil change, however neglected to tell me anything. parts are incredibly expensive, and the dealerships, unless you are dropping 80,000 for a range rover, just plain dont care...DONT DO IT!
