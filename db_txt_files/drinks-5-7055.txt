Did a comparison test against Spudka out of Hood River, OR. Pulled them both off the freezer shelf and let them warm up to just short of room temp. Different aromas, neither is unpleasant. They both start out easy and ride nicely on the palate. Alas, the Spudka - I didn't truly expect any more - finishes with a burn, which while not unpleasant, was not reflected in the Chopin. The Chopin finished even more smoothly than it started with an ever so slight after-taste that left me wanting more. Wonderful vodka.
