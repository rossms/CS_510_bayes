Truman Capote researched this murder case intensely to write this book. Instead of it being speculative and fictionalised, it tells an account of what the murderers and the family they killed were like, even what the friends of the family were like along with the family of the murderers were like as well. it does raise questions as well as answering others. Its a worthwhile read if you want to read a murder account that isn't sensationalized, this is down to earth and tells it how it was from the perspective of the family, the murderers and the people close to them.
