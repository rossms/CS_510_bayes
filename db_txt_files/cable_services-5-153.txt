I've had Directv for almost a year and I think it's great. I had Comcast cable and they charged me an arm and a leg. Comcast cable cost me more with digital cable in one room, than Direct costs me in three rooms and I get more channels. Customer service is also better than Comcast cable. In addition, I read some of the other opinions in regards to Directv going out when the weather is inclement. In my experience, Directv has gone out twice for approximately 10 minutes. However, Comcast cable went out on me also for as long as 3 days. I'll take 10 minutes any day over 3 days.
