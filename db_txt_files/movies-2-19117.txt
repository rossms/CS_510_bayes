Whoever thought up this movie was very twisted. People are killed in unimaginably disguisting ways, and the ending is a big disappointment. There are WAY TOO MANY FLASHBACKS, and you never know when things are taking place. The ending leaves you wondering way too much and you don't know the fate of all but one of the major charecters! all in all, if you are really curiouse and want to see the movie, i would suggest waiting until it comes out on video/dvd. DON'T WASTE MONEY ON GOING TO THE MOVE THEATERS, AT LEAST NOT ON THIS MOVIE. GOD KNOWS HOW EXPENSIVE EVERYTHING IS IN THEATRES NOW!
