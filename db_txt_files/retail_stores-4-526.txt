i love express clothing. they have the best fitting jeans of any i've tried and i really like their bra tops as well. they do have seasons where they seem to miss. a lot. but overall i like their clothing. and some of the colors are bad, but i tend to favor black and they make everything in black anyway. i've never noticed the clothing being poor quality and don't have a single express item that has fallen apart. definitely a store i'll be shopping at for a long time.
