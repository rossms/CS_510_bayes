I worked at US BANK for 4 1/2 years. They found an excuse to fire me 6 months before I was pension eligible. I started in a new position 1 year before, I received neglible training. Was told to ask questions, given wrong answers and told I should have dug deeper. They kept changing procedures, and upping our productivity goals and quality standards. Everything was so arbritary. I was walked out the door 3 days before Thanksgiving. They really care about their employees. they preach 5 star guarantee but just care about making mone and screw the employees and customers.
