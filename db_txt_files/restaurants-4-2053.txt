I agree with beckyncats. I, too, recently moved to Florida from Oklahoma. The only thing here is Taco Bell, and we all know how awful that is. Taco Bueno is desperately needed in Florida, the Tampa area would be nice. I know I would frequent it and it would be a big hit here, where people think Taco Bell is acutally good. What do you say, Bueno? Want to expand to the Florida market and show people what Mexican fast food is really all about?
