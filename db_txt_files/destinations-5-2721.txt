I think Chicago tries to be New York, but it doesn't even come close. I think it is saturated with sheltered suburban rich kids who all look the same, dress the same, and act the same. I'm especially talking about parts of the North Side (Lincoln Park, the Gold Coast, etc). I live in St. Louis and it seems like all the kids from the suburbs here move there without even getting to know this city. So I say, Chicago can have them! I will stay in St. Louis...we have everything Chicago has, except the lake, and a lot that Chicago doesn't have. If I was to move to a bigger city, I'd go for the gold--NYC.
