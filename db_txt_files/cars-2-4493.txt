I loved my'95 Windstar, until at 60K miles the headgasket blew, costing me $1650. Three days after I picked it up, the engine also died due to antifreeze in the oil during the gasket fiasco. What makes matter worse, is that Ford knows they have a defective part and they fail to re-call it! I can not recommend this vehicle to anyone!
