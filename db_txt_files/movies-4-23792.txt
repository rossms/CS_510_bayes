Yes this movie is a one of those Hollywood Recipe movies, but it is better than most of the genre. Don't buy this if you are expecting something thought provoking - however it is definitely worth renting / having if you are looking for 120 minutes of solid entertainment - a compelling storyline, a likeable hero in Will Smith, and some fabulous special effects.
