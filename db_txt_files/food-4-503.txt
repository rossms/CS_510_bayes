This is my second favorite cereal. If you have a bit of a sweet tooth, Apple Jacks has to be a winner. The touch of cinnamon makes this cereal all the more exciting for me. I love apples and cinnamon but too much of these flavors is too much. Apple Jacks is the perfect combo of both with a light and fluffy texture with a sweet bite to it. It's the bomb.
