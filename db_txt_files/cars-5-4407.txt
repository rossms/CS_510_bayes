WOW! Only a hand full of the ratings are good. I have a Windstar (we have 6 kids) and I thought that this was one of the highest rated vans when I bought it. I am going to guess that people are having a lot of problems w/ the older models (95-96). I do a lot of traveling out of my van. It is a 99 w/ 46k on it now and I have never had one problem w/ it. I love it! Leather interior, cd changer,premium sound ect ect. It is a great van! Well worth the money.
