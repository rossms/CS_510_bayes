I have never had a problem w/ Whitehall Jewelers! I purchased a diamond necklace, gold earings, there and my engagment ring and both wedding bands were purchased there. I've had all the jewelery appraised and everything that the store told me about the diamonds was correct. Also, everytime I go there the customer service is wonderful (although that may be store specific i guess...). I have had jewelry sized and ordered there and everything was done correctly and w/in the time that they told me to. My engagement ring was upgraded and there was no problems doing it.
