I came to this CD, not by having listened to any previous Radiohead albums, but from having admired Thom Yorke's collaborations with Bjork and PJ Harvey. Immediately after having ordered the CD online I read a very hostile review of Kid A in The New Yorker. The critic suggested that Radiohead go back to being a pop band and stop the pretentious BS. I was apprehensive, therefore, that I had wasted my money. But I'm listening to Kid A as I write this--about my fourth listening--and loving it. A highly pleasureable experience. Very intelligent music. Maybe I wouldn't like the earlier stuff?
