Guess what, people! (Dubya speaking.) While I was governer of Texas, the fuzzy math scores in Texas rose by nearly 100%! Amazing! Incredible! That is amazing, right? And I promise not to puke on Japanese statesmen like my dad, who happens to be the reason I was ever in the military! Thanks, Dad, for doing that as well as getting me into Yale. Is you listening? Oops, sorry, that old mistake! Well, goodbye people! This is what I have to say about Dubya. Goodbye, people!
