I think Midwesterner19 might be stretching things to say that East Colfax is more interesting than LoDo, but he does have a point - LoDo is fun, with lots of bars and restaurants, but it has sort of a homogenous feel to it. Still, it's located right in downtown, near all the major sites, and not far from the 16th St. Mall. It's very hard to argue with the location if you're going to live in Denver.
