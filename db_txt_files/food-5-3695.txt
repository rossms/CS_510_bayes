Years ago, say....30, Keebler had a cookie called "Pitter Patters" and these cookies are very similar, if not exactly the same. I rarely eat cookies, but when the annual sale starts, you can be sure that I will purchase a minimum of 10 boxes for myself. My family loves the other selections and buy enough to make the quota for many of the girls within the Council! Seriously, if you want a Super Peanut Butter Cookie, this is the one that will become a personal tradition.
