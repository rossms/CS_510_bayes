I first enjoyed the taste of this wonderful Weissbier when I stayed with a family in Munich. It goes great with a weisswurst, which is a Baverian sausage. I was thrilled to find out it was sold in America. It has a smoothe, fuity taste to it that can be relished from beginning to end. I highly recommend this beer to anyone looking for something new or for anyone that enjoys weissbier.
