I'm terribly disappointed in my recent purchase of a used 1999 Blazer. I'm lucky if I get 14 mpg in the city and 16 on the city freeways. I have never been able to get over 19 mpg on long trips. Not only is the gas mileage terrible, but I find that when I go over bumps or railroad tracks over 4 doors and the hatch shake extremely bad and sound like they are slightly ajar, but they are not. I just put brand new Yokahma tires on it and was hoping to see improvement in the shakiness, but it does not appear to have helped. Other than the points mentioned above, my blazer has been an overall OK.
