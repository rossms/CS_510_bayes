I remember reading that this wasn't just another chilren's book. Baum ment it as a social commentary of the times and a veiled statement obout communism. It is filled with secret meanings (sorta like a literary version of Don McClean's AMERICAN PIE). I had a teacher in High School who wore a YELLOW BRICK ROAD costume on Halloween. She said we walked all over her anyway, so she might as well dress the part!! She wore a yellow shirt and pants, using black electrical tape to seperate the bricks. One of the most memorable costumes I have ever seen.
