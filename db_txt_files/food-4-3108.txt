Nilla Wafers are strange cookies. They're plain to the point of being dull, but man they taste good sometimes. I don't find myself craving a Nilla Wafer very often, but when I do start eating them it's tough to stop. They're especially good dipped in milk. Plus they bring back a lot of good childhood memories.
