04-05 was a bit of a bust, but that's to be expected with a team as young as IU was. I see a lot of good things in the future, with all four of this year's freshmen returning, the addition of Marco Killingsworth, and the fact that Mike Davis is under real pressure from the administration. You'll see that pressure come out in some hopefully great coaching and that will lead to wins. Indianapolis in April '06?
