It was just okay. The guide gives me all of the recycled crap that a Disneyland guide might have missed. (Oh, but ummm, I guess the USA is one big Disneyland to Let's Go.) The guide seems to neglect 'true America' that is found off the interstate. The true culture of Generica, oh, I mean America, is on the desolate country roads of the Midwest.
