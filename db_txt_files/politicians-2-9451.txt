I really think he had a chance at becoming a great president. He had the battle reputation and popularity to help him achive what he wanted. However he chose a man he completely differed with politically as his VP and ultimately screwed his party out of a president because when Tyler took over he sided with the Democrats on most issues. So had he not died he may have become a solid president but in reality he did more harm to his party than good. (Note to self-- When I become president and make a two hour inaguration speech listen to mom, wear a coat).
