FANTASTIC vehicle! Bought an Eddie Bauer the last year they were made ('96) and have been amazed at how well it hold's value! Roomy and luxurious with a motor (5.8L) that ALWAYS has enough juice. After 5 years and almost 80k, finally had to replace alternator, battery and shocks. JUST right for 2-3 people. I'd buy a new one if they still made 'em. The replacement Excursion and Expedition are ridiculously too big and pricey for our family of three...
