I really didn't read as much as I should have when I was growing up but this is one book that I did read and remember loving. I would actually read a little each night before bed. I just remember imagining what it would be like to be in this Giant Peach with all the insect, bug characters, escaping from the mean aunts. I loved it. I thought is was great. It is the kind of book that lasts throughout time. I am kind of sad that there is a movie because it takes away the element of imagination.
