Miami is definitely a team that in its current status will break your heart. Already, they have lost their home opener (very rare for the Dolphins to lose in September period). However, name recognition and satistic wise, they're can virtually become one of, if not, the best overall team this season. They can be Super Bowl contenders. They just have to get the historical monkeys off their back (Lose frequently at away games, lose against teams they should satistically beat, have more than a 1 game lead in their decision, sit down on a first-half lead too much that they'll blow the game, and so on).
