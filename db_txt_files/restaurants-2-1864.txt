Let's face it - most of us don't want to see the guy who is making our fast food. So it defies logic why taco bell does not separate the consumer from the cook the way burger joints do. It seems like every I stop at any Taco Bell, there's a nose-dripping, ungloved cooks. Yuck. Taco Bell should either institute an employee hygiene code, or follow the big boys and throw the cooks out back.
