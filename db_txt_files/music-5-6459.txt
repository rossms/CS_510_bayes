Bought this CD, the day it came out and was floored by how good it was. Nobody is better than Alice at clever lyrics. This is one of the few CD's from 2001 that never leaves my CD player. The song, Fantasy Man, is the catchiest Alice song in years. I can't fathom why Spitfire Records did not release it as a single.
