george happens to be one of my relatives so i may be sort of impartial. however, i feel he is definitely one of the most underrated ballplayers ever. he had a .365 average up until 1923 when he suffered a major sinus infection. he played for basically 14 years and if he had played much longer would definitely been the all time hits leader well over pete rose. oh yeah nobody will ever get 257 hits in a season
