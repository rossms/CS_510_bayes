Edmonton is a good place to live and visit. It has the largest connected park system in North America, over 60 golf courses, the worlds largest mall, and a lot of culture. Despite what many people might think, Edmonton has one of the most educated populations in North America, and the people here are very kind and tolerant. Not too many rednecks. Now just over a million people, Edmonton is on the verge of becoming a metropolis. Although Calgary has a major corporate sector and a little more money, it is at the cost of its culture.
