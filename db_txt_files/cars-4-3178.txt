I have been out road-testing several SUVs and I'm very impressed with the 4Runner...lots of great features, everything is very expensive, but these are reasonably priced compared to their competitors...I really like the 4Runner Limited with the leather interior and expanded feature package...the vehicle handled beautifully, smooth ride and after rehashing all this in my mind, I think I'm going to go buy one...
