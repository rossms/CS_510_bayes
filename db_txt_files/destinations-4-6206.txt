Oh, YES! A solid, scenic Great Lakes state with water, water, everywhere. (Don't know if I'd want to drink it these days.) The UP is rustic, scenic, and very beautiful. Perfect breeding grounds for militia folk. Marquette is a nice little burg with very down-to-earth folk. Owosso and central Michigan are nice little farming communities with the solid family and religious values so pre-eminent in the Upper Midwest. Good stuff. Lansing, Flint, Saginaw, Kalamazoo, Detroit...urban centers that have been losing population for a long time. Kind of like Buffalo, where I live. All told, a nice state.
