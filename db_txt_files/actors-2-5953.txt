This man acted well in Born on the Fourth of July and Collateral, but he's weak in just about everything else. He's rated highly because he has a good look about him. But then again if you grab a model and point him in the direction he's supposed to walk in, they'll look pretty good. A good specimen of a human being, but not an all time great; on the other hand if you settle for mediocrity and brand placement then he's your man.
