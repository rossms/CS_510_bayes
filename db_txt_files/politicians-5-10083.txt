It is unbelievable how many people hate this man! A natural born leader who doesnt bend over and take it from terrorist!! If it werent for the Clinton Administration, there would not have been a 911. It is amazing to see how critic people are of the War in Iraq. If it were for oil do u think gas prices would still be so high? Be rational before you dumbass liberals start talking out of your ass. Look at the casualty ratings as well. In January Iraq only had 39 deaths compared to 34 murders in Detriot, Michigan. That is one city compared to an entire country.
