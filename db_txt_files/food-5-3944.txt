You can really always count on the fact that these will be fresh. They also have an excellent flavor and are salted just right (well, to my personal taste anyway). I recently discovered one other brand I like as well (Hanover). Just as good, but a slightly different flavor. All in all, you really can't beat Rold Gold in both consistency and quality.
