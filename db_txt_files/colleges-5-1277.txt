Go bears! i go to Berkeley as well. Just wanted to say that sometimes life here is hard, but sometimes it's great to bask in its' glory. truly one of the most exhilirating colleges in america. a real vibe of life. where else can you find so many people willing to discuss quantum physics, ethics, or TV while eating zachary's pizza and downing a beer?
