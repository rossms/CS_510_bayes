Frank Howard is Clemson's most winnegest coach. He led Clemson to many winning seasons, brought Clemson to the program it is known for today. Clemson named the field in Memorial Stadium (Death Valley) after Howard. The players rub Howard's Rock when running down "The Hill" before each game. One of the most loved coaches ever - anywhere. I am not a Clemson fan, but I honestly have to say that Frank Howard was the best coach to ever coach at Clemson University. Without Howard, Clemson would not be such a well-known school, and Death Valley would not be Death Valley! (the ORIGINAL Death Valley)
