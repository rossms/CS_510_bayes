I love Jonathon on HomeImprovement I think it's great that he started at such a young age in acting because that is tough to do. And I think that if he wants to keep going in his career then that is his choice. And yeah he did do a lot of kiddy films but you know what, I bet he got a lot of money out of it. (he was probably very rich at a young age.)
