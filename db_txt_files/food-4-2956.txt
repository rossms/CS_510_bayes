I've always enjoyed Oreo cookies, but for some reason, I only buy them every once and a while. They are usually my choice when I get tired of something else that I have been buying for a while. They're always my fill-in cookie, no pun intended. Of course I love dipping the Oreos in the milk as much as the next guy, but I just don't buy these too often because to me, they are only good every once in a while.
