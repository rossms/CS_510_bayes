Got a 2000 Astro AWD and it is an incredibly stable vehicle. Granted, it has a mid-80's body style, but it offers the most room in it's class, has more features than I could ever use, and is rock solid in the frame and AWD drivetrain. We had lot's of snow here in Washington this year and when asked how it handled on snowy/icy roads, all I could say was who can tell? it maintained the road so well. Much beter than the 1998Subaru Outback Legacy AWD wagon we traded in on it. The 4.3l V-6 is an incredible engine, 6200lb tow capacity and I can't wait for our first trailer trip this summer!
