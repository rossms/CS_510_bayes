a pretty funny movie. Cary Grant finds his eccentric elderly aunties are killing off their guests by poisoning them. what is amusing is it is hard to believe these sweet old ladies are doing this yet they are so nonchalant about it you would think nothing is wrong with what they doing. It has some very funny scenes. It does drag in some parts otherwise a good movie.
