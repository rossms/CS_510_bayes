I never read a Robert Stanek series before this. With this book, the beautiful cover caught my eye and made me lift it from the shelf. The book description made me buy it, and the wondrous story made me love it! Immediately, afterwards, I began devouring the rest of this great series - eagerly awaiting the next. For other readers who like me find it difficult to leap into a new fantasy world, this book is great at bringing you into this great new world. Trust me, it's a great series to leap into, with so many great possibilities.
