As far as I'm concerned he was a great president! I don't care about his personal life. Mr Clinton was a wonderful leader, diplomat and extremely intellegent. He wasn't a puppet, we knew who was running the country. Weren't we all better off then? He had a great smile, a wonderfully genuine laugh and he loved the people.
