Although I do happen to be a Trekkie, this game just doesn't seem all that fun to me. This doesn't require much strategy, only making your ship/s ready for battle, and it obviously doesn't require skill. The only thing you do seem to need to play it is a lot of patience while you're waiting five minutes for your weapons to charge up. If I weren't a Trekkie, or if this weren't a Star Trek game, I probably wouldn't have given it even a two. On the other hand, if I had played the 2-player games maybe I wouldn't go so hard on it. TOO BAD THEY DON'T SEEM TO WORK ON MY COMPUTER!!!
