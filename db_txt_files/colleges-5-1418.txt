Newberry is a great college. I graduated a number of years ago, but the things that made Newberry special when I was the student are the same things that make it special today...small classes, a place where you are a name, not a number, an outstanding liberal arts curriculum. It is in a great location and the campus is small but beautiful in a charming southern town. What more can anyone want?
