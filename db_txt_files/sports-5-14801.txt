I love it when people try to say, Emmitt's career was great because of his offensive line. Don't all running backs need a good offensive line to be productive? Emmitt is one of the toughest and most durable running backs this league has ever seen! Do I really need to whip out my stat book???? I didn't think so!!!!!
