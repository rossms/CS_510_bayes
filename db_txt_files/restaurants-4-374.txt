I like the dollar menu.You can get a potato,decent salad,decent chili,burger and drink for around 5 bucks and it's all pretty good.Beats the McDonald's dollar menu for sure.Just wish these places could get good help.They never gives you all the things you need with the food like cutlery and napkins etc. and the words Thank You are rarely heard.
