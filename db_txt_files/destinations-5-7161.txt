My favorite city. Madrid has a little bit of everything - from historical sites, to a raging nightlife, to gorgeous architecture, to beautiful friendly people, etc, etc. I spent a wonderful couple of days in the old section of Madrid, immersed in the best nightlife I have ever seen. Hundreds of cool, unique bars line the maze like streets, and there is plenty of action going on into the next day. If you have any energy left, make sure you check out the Palacio Real and the Prado.
