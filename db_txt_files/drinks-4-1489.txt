Always enjoyed a Cold Bud although I have switched to Coors Original Long Necks. I like Busch, but it's all most impossible to find it in long necks around here. I can't stand any beer in a can. We have a Bud brewery 40 miles from here and a few workers have said that the push is now on quantity instead quality. Seems to happen to all companies when they get on top, then they start with the short cuts.
