ok here it goes.... im a woman of few words, i'll keep it succinct heheh... i feel that joshua jackson has a natural talent as he can master his roles quite well, though, and it has been said before, the roles he takes on are always very similar and i guess to put it bluntly it sucks. He has great potential therefore he should move towards roles that demand more from him, something that completely differs from his real persona. That is why I have given him 4/5 stars. The other element that has enabled his success is his spunkiness. :P
