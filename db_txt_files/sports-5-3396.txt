Perhaps the game's most consistent right-handed hitter, Roger Hornsby captured seven batting titles-including six in a row - averaging better than .400 threee times. A complete player whose passion for the game was shown both on and of the field, Hornsby's .424 mark in 1924 is a National League record for the 20th century and his career average of .359 is the highest ever in the National League. The Rajah, a two-time MVP and Triple Crown winner, was the player-manager of the Cardinals' first World Series team in 1926. Roger Hornsby was inducted to the National Baseball Hall of Fame in 1942.
