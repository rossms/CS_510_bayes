I'm not from the U.K., so I'm not entirely qualified to comment. Did she really get the U.K. out of hardship? Or did she create the faux-hardship? I'm not a fan of the British Conservatives. Any party that has to pander to an antiquated Monarchy is regressive. Then again, it doesn't seem like Tony Blair stands for ANY party. Anyway, old Maggie seemed to leave a bipolar legacy. Loved or loathed. I don't like her.
