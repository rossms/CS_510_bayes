This film is definitely worth a viewing. I originally thought that my being somewhat of a (were not talking convention going uniform wearing wierdo, I just like the show) trekie was the reason why I found it entertaining. However, my stepfather thought it was funny indeed. The movie is light, and the story, predictable, but comfortably so. The humor is great, especially from the supporting characters.
