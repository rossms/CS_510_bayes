A must see film on all levels. Rutger Hauer (sp?) was THE movie villan. He always has a knack for portraying psychotic people. Howell really stepped it up to play the everyman hero. The suspense don't build throughout the movie, it simply blasts off and you are hanging on the entire film. The movie will leave you paranoid for Howell's charector until the final credits roll.
