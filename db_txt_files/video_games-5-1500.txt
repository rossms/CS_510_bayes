This is another shining example of a great Nintendo game. The graphics are stupendous. There isn't any real music, usually. But, the ambient sound is very realistic. This game is also in its own genre. It's a first person adventure. Yes, it's a shooter. But it's also an adventure. The two combined are quite interseting.
