I own a 2004 CTS with the 3.6L 255HP V6 and 5 speed auto. I have never been as happy with a car as this one! Great handling and a ton of get up and go. Some diss the interior, but I think it fits the car to a T. Even a 400 mile trip reveals nothing but positives about this car! Comfortable and supportive seats, fantastic powertrain and lots of admiring looks. The only negative may be that it's hard to estimate distance when parallel parking. Otherwise, I've got 18K on this car and not a single problem!
