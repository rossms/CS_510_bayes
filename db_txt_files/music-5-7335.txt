I Love Michael Joseph Jackson soooooo much. He is a living unlegend I couldn't image going a day without thinking about him or listening to his music and watching his videos. He is the most talented person, dancer, singer, song writer in the world. He created music videos, and Thriller was breathtaking, he is the most well known person all around the world and fans love him like crazy, like me! The dancing, outfits, plots of all the videos of his are amazing, and Thriller is so great and long!! I love Michael Jackson always and Forever!
