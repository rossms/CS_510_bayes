Beautiful on a hot day. Best on tap. It is refrshing and quenching with a nice sweetness balanced by dry spiciness with a slight bitter hop & orange peel in the finish. Excellent brew - represents the style perfectly. Make sure the damn bartender doesn't stick a damn lemon in your glass though. It kills the head retention. lemon is reserved for crappy swill beers as a means of killing the taste.
