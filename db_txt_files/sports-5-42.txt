What strikes me as odd in this day and age is his humility. The only thing he seems to care about is whether the team wins or loses. Considering what he is doing this year, and what he has done the last four, 100 million over seven years is a bona fide deal. If St. Louis wouldn't have locked him in, I have a feeling he would be making twice this much playing for the yankees. A true class act. He also gives millions to charity every year. How many professional athletes do that anymore out of true sincerity?
