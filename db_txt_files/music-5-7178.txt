this song is so amazing. and the video is so great! a really clever partnership between song and video. this is a song which has made me cry many a time. and to think... i was only 2 when it was released! It sends shivers down my spine when i watch the video. This song is perfect for those times you feel like giving up... hold on, hold on, 'cause everybody hurts...aww soo pretty
