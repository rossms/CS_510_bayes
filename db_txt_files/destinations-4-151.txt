We enjoyed Singapore when we were there in February 2005. Of course, it was Chinese New Year so we saw all the decorations in Chinatown and several lion dances which we just happened upon as we were walking about. Some former students of ours and their parents took us to the Night Safari at the zoo which was quite interesting. We also enjoyed walking on the waterfront and in the parks near the waterfront.
