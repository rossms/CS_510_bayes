Quito rates up in the top 5 cities of South America, and I have seen them all during my tenure with the State Department. Quito is a wonderful city to retire for an American. Quito offers climate that is hard to beat. It's layout in the Valley among the mountains is breathtaking and the Ocean is not far away for weekend getaways. IF you have not been to Ecuador, Quito must be on the list to visit. I am even thinking of opening up an American Barbeque/Grill restaurant in the near future. Perfectly timed for the relations between U.S. and Ecuadoreans.
