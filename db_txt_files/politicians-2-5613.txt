I feel that I should like and support Hillary Clinton, because she is a Democrat and I probably would agree with her on the issues. But the fact is I just don't like her. As I expressed in a previous post, I met her when I was a college student, and she came off as very cold. She doesn't seem like a warm or feminine person. I just have a very bad feeling about her.
