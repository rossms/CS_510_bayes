My favorite place to visit in the entire world. I've been going to NS for more than 20 years and have never had a bad experience. Don't miss the Maritime Museum in Halifax, or the Fisheries Museum in Lunenburg, either is worth your entire trip! The Lighthouse Route and also Kejimkujik National Park are also favorites, and well off the beaten path. Some real solitude and majestic scenery can be had there.
