When I sold my camry it had over 222,000 miles on it! I purchased it with 130k miles already on it. Great car, it held up really well although I drove it heavily. Its not the 'perfect' car, but it has very responsive steering, good power, a decent amount of room and VERY reliable. It had a variety of problems when I sold it, but these issues where things that tend to deteriorate over time (such as engine seals, belts, etc.). How many cars can you think of WONT need to replace belts and seals at 222k miles? Exactly, a Toyota Camry. Great car!!!
