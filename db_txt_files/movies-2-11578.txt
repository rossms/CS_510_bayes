This movie wasn't worth seeing in the theatre. It's not very funny, or for that matter entertaining. You're time will be wasted if you see this in the theatre, trust me and rent it instead. That way the enoying thickheaded laughter and applause from the deadhead audience wont get on your nerves like it got on mine. I give it two stars for making my sister laugh every once in a great while.
