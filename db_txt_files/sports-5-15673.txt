What can you say about him that hasn't been said before? The man leaves everything on the field, doesn't get caught up in petty, immature arguments, and he works in his community. Put him at 4th receiver and he still lights up the score board. And selfless. Sure he wants the ball, but he wants to put his team in the best position to win. A couple of years ago, when the secondary was devastated by injuries and incompetence, he offered to play corner until players healed up. That's rare these days.
