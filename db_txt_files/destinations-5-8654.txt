I am just a Freshman in H.S. and i have been dipping since the end of 8th grade. Is it true they are coming out with watermelon? And does anyone know if Skoal is coming out with Frost Pouches, that would be so awesome because i love frost but i like pouches bc of my braces. It doesnt matter that much to me bc i just love dipping, i go through about a can ever 1 and a half days and ive tryed ever kind of skoal some grizzly, wolf, kodiak, and copenhagen. Kodiak Ice is almost as good as Frost though, but nothing can beat Frost.
