It was just a fun song, and the video did it justice! It's hilarious! Especially looking back now, at the extreme hair and make-up on them, it cracks me up! Every time I hear that song on one of the local rock stations here in Baltimore, I picture the band shaking their fists at the father guy . . . it's great!
