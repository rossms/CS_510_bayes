The Garden State gets a pretty bad rap. The beaches are fun, if not breathtakingly beautiful, and there are some neat little towns (Princeton, Moorestown), and the Pine Barrens National Forest. While the area around the NJ Turnpike is truly one of the earth's armpits, it's a pretty nice place elsewhere.
