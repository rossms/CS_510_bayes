I am very pleased with Kay Jewelers. Both of me and my ex fiancee's ring were put on my account. We had a fight and broke up but had made extra payments on both rings together previously. I got a full credit on both rings. I also got a credit for a new ring. I had also bought two new rings since. The staff in Msla was understanding and has always worked with, and provided me with excellent customer service. I have no complaints at all!
