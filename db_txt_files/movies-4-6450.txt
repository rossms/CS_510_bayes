The dead genre of the comedy of manners can be revived by renting this movie. I don't know why some people have given it a rating of 1. Personally, I think it is a pretty good movie with a great old-time cast and a clever, witty script. Billie Burke and Marie Dressler had some funny moments, and Jean Harlow was sexy.
