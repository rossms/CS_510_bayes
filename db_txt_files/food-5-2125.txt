If it weren't for Snickers candy bars, I wouldn't have gotten through all those late nights in college. They were the perfect pick-me-up (especially since I hate coffee). Packed with tons of pure evil goodness, these things really hit the sweet spot and fill you up. If you're looking for more content for your buck, Snickers wins hands-down. I think it has the highest weight-to-price ratio out there. LOL. It's DENSE. Very dense. And in a candy bar, that's a very good thing. Definitely in my Top 5 list.
