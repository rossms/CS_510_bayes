The only candy bar I've seen also sold as cookies. A great concept--cookies and candy combined. I remember when these first came out. There was a bar called Summit (anyone else remember those?) that came out around the same time. Same cookie/candy combination, only with wafers and peanuts. THAT was a good bar. Bring em back!
