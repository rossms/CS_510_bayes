Shawshank Redemption is a good movie, but highly overrated. On IMDb, it's rated No.2 best of all time. There is no way it's better than Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring, which is rated No.3 of all time on the IMDb's top 250 list. On a scale of 1-10 for Shawshank: 9/10, but not 2nd best or first best of all time for drama.
