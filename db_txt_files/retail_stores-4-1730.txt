I like wal-mart, if i hear one more knee jerk reactionary comment about wal-mart running "mom and pop" stores out of business i'll scream!!!! Wal-mart has it all under one roof for the home, garden, and car and at hard to beat prices. I'm on a budget (like most people), i also dont have endless free time to go to nay different "mom and pop" stores to get all my stuff, I also find the "few" extra cents these stores charge add up to a fair chunk of change.
