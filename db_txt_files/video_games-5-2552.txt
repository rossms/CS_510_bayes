One of the best DS games out there.And possibly ever. The animals are more complex (personality wise),the dialogue is more varied,and Gracie is still the evilist creature in the game. You get to choose where your house is,and it gets a hell of a lot bigger because of more expansions.The hats from the first game are gone for the most part (Now the boy characters don't look like they have horns!Yay),/AND/ you get to change your hair colour and style once you get Nookington's. Yes.
