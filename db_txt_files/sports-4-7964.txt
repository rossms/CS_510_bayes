A ball hog...yes, but also a winner. I don't think anybody in the NBA competes harder than Iverson, and although he may have an attitude and a bad image, it does not take away from his amazing competitive nature. Its pretty amazing that a person of his size can consistently be at the top of the NBA scoring list.
