Automatic For The People earns it's fifthe star just beacause of the influence of this album. The rest is wholey deserved by the album. Apart from the hit songs that appear on the album (nearly all), it is the atmosphere the album creates with just little tracks like New Orleans Instrumental No1. You can only get what the album means by listening through the whole thing, rewinding and playing again. It runs like a story with Find The River being one of the most perfect last tracks on nearly any album to date.
