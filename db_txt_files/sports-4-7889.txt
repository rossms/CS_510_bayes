KG is a league superstar...when he learns to be a team player... then he will be a great player...But until he's got a ring on his hand...keep the names Wilt,Kareem,MJ,Magic,Larry, etc. out of your mouth when you speak of KG...If he didn't take that fat contract maybe the T-Wolves could sign a decent player...should've thought about it a little more KG...and get off Wally's back before he's gone too...But you won't see the T-Wolve's win a championship any time soon thanks to KG
