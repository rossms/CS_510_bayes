My husband surprised me with a diamond bracelet for Christmas that he purchased from Jared. The bracelet is absolutely beautiful, wonderful quality, and so much more than I could have hoped for. I also took a ring there to hve some repairs done...the ring was not purchased from them, but it still received wonderful work and was ready for pickup in a little over an hour.
