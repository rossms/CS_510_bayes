Oh, I just love it when I see all the women talking about how men come here for the girls and not for the food and all that bull. I have been going to Hooters for about 10 years, and my family has never had any problem with going to Hooters. I mean, GOD FORBID THAT THERE BE A RESTAURANT WITH ATTRACTIVE WOMEN AS WAITRESSES!!!!! That would be SO bad. Get over it people.
