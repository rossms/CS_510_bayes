My 1999 Alero has 62,000 miles on it and I haven't had any problems outside of a routine brake job and a power steering repair (which was under warranty at the time). The only reason I didn't give it a 5 is because the door seals on the back doors aren't very good and at high speeds I can really hear the wind whipping. I could get it replaced easily enough but it hasn't bothered me enough to do so. Everything else has been perfect, though. The Alero is a great car and I assume that it's only gotten better since 1999.
