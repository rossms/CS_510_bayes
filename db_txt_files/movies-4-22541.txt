One of the all-time great Superhero classics. Batman truly delivered, with an amazing cast for one (espescially with Jack Nicholson as the Joker), and Michael Keaton did a surprisingly good job as Batman. Kim Basinger was lovely as always. I loved the action and how Tim Burton tried to stay as true to the comic books as he could while still making Batman seem real. A good film!
