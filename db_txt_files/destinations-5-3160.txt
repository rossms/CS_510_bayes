I can definately say that Toronto is by far my favorite city in all of Canada. Not only are the people awesome, but the city is clean and there is always something to do. The guys are smart and cute too. Toronto is definately its own city and does NOT need to copy anybody...in fact I have been to a city or two that tries to copy Toronto...
