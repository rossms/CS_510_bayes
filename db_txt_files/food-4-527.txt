I do enjoy lucky charms....however i would just like to comment on one of the shapes that the little cereal bits come in. The fish, has anyone ever noticed that it is the christiantiy symbol? Is this a subliminal message? Is christianity trying too convert all who eat lucky charms? a wierd coincidence or has christianity gone a little too far? Please let me know what you think!
