It's sad how GM is abandoning it's most venerated and respected nameplates. First, it was the Buick Riviera, and now the entire Oldsmobile division. Next on the chopping block is the Camaro/Firebird I hear. What's going to be left at GM after all the bloodshed? Nothing. GM is doing itself a great disservice and is driving away loyal customers. I'm more of an import enthusiast but I still find it shameful that Olds is coming to an end. I believe that Olds' current lineup was the best weapon for the domestics in fending off further market penetration by the imports. The question is, with Olds gone what now?
