Um, OK. Nice try Pontiac. Take the platform from the Toyota Corolla and Toyota's 1.8L engine with VVT-i and spice it up with traditional Pontiac styling cues (i.e. the split grille). No thanks. The Matrix, Toyota's version of the same vehicle, looks much better and is likely to retain higher resale value into the future because of it's Toyota nameplate. Anybody remember GM and Toyota's joint venture with the Chevrolet Nova and Toyota Corolla? Nobody bought the Chevy version. People didn't want a Toyota with Chevy badges on it. I predict the exact same thing for the Vibe/Matrix.
