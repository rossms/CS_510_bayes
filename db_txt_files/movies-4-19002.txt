Interesting movie about vampires and werewolves; the vampires want to maintain a pure bloodline while the werewolves are searching for a way to combine the bloodlines. The premise is better than the actual final product, but the acting was pretty good (especially by Kate Beckinsale and the guy who played Viktor) and the effects were decent. All in all, it's worth a look.
