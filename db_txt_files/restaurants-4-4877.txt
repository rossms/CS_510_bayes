I refrain from giving it a 5, because I haven't been in 5 years, and thus there's a chance it's gone downhill just like every other chain restaurant in America. The 4 stars applies to all the times I ate there in the 90s. Service was good, dining area was very cozy and romantic, a great place to dine with a date.
