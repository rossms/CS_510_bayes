A great way to kill time! As a kid I never could get more than three sides, but now that I'm all 'growed' up, I think I understand how this befuddling device works. I've been threatening to buy another one for years. I think I might next time I'm out and about. I won't be able to die in peace knowing I was unable to solve this 'great' mystery!
