My family traveled to Knoxville in 2002 to see the Volunteers play Miami. In the days leading up to the game, we visited Smokie Mountains. What vistas! The surrounding areas of Knoxville were nice, the Tennessee River was an awesome sight. I did think the UT campus was lame, though. They went nuts with 70's architecture which does not hold up well today. Other than that, my visit was pleasant and I plan to see other parts of the state in my next visit.
