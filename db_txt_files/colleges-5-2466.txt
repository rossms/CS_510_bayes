The US News and World Report ranks Sewanee as one of the top universities in the nation. It has a college of liberal arts and school of theology. It is, in fact, one of the greatest kept secrets among American universities. It is one of the few universities in the nation that refuses to inflate grades. Only about 25% of graduates can expect to have a 3.0 GPA. Sewanee requires a great deal from its students. However, if you are looking for a great liberal arts school, whose students have a high rate of admission into graduate schools, look no further than the University of the South.
