It was very addictive for the first few days, until I got the largest camp upgrade, after that it all went downhill. There was nothing new, just training troops, attacking, training, attacking, I saw no benefit really, so I gave it up. I found it way too simple for my tastes. I'm not saying you won't like it, it just wasn't involved enough to have any strategic value, thus sapping the fun the first few days had.
