Kevin is a great ball player, he plays solid defense, although not real shot blocker, he runs the floor as good as any big man in college if not better. His offense speaks for its self. Only improvement would be, is to be more agressive and slam the ball in oposing players faces. He is a very underrated player, His contributions to this team and to any lucky NBA team are and would be tremendous. He also has a good supporting cast at WVU. Mike Gansey, Jo Herber, Frank Young, J.D. Collins, Patrick Belein, Rob Summers, Alexander Ruoff, Joe Alexander and the rest of the team... Go Mountaineers!!
