Hello.... In Yerington, Nevada the CHARTER CABLE video stinks on 30 percent of the channels we receive. The primary bitch is the downlink of local channels. I've worked in TV and advanced electronics for 45 years and can't understand why we have to pay for "NOISY" video....I know what the problem is...Some channels have "cross talk", some have "co channel interference", and on and on. We shouldn't have to pay for this in 2005. I retain an FCC General license which I've had for years and an associates degree in electrical engineering.........If I can help, let me know via e-mail....
