I'm embarassed to say that I have only been in two countries besides the U.S. - Mexico and Canada (and I've been told that they don't count because they're attached). But each time I've been to Canada I have enjoyed it very much. It is a beautiful place. Most of the people are very friendly. Some of them like to pick on Americans but they do it in a good-natured way. They get their share of being picked on as well.
