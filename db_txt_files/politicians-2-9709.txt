Despite the liberal media's adoration of LBJ and his expansion of entitlements (which almost bankrupted the country), he was a terrible/bad president: expanded the Vietnam War without a goal or commitment to win; prosecuted the war based on poll-numbers at home; kicked off what became the stagflation of the 1970's with his expansion of gov't and deficit spending (via entitlements). And he was crooked (Billie Sol Estes, Bobby Baker). Rate him where he belongs: in the cellar!
