If you're going to smoke menthol, then KOOL's are the one. I favor KOOL Super Longs over the king size for a longer smoke at the same price. I hear Newport loyal people talk about menthol flavor and all I can think is, they know not what they speak! Newports are fine for people who flip-flop between regulars and menthols but if it's menthol you crave, than look no further.
