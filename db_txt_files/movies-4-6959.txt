How could I possibly be expected to go to school on a day like this. Probably means more to people who were teenagers around that time and it was conceivable possible to get away with skipping school on occassion (not that I did...although I did). A good cameo by Charlie Sheen, and any movie that involves Wrigley Field is nice. However, Ferris does incorrectly identify John Lennon as the walrus. That was Paul McCartney, of course.
