I have been with T-Mobile for about four months. The plans are somewhat satisfactory. However, the only con of T-Mobile is that they do not provide free nights. They do provide free weekends, of course. I'm thinking of switching because of this free nights issue. In addition, sometimes I receive bad signal. I installed a internal antenna on my phone and it did improve. I'm not sure if it's the phone or service. T-Mobile is a good company, but it needs free nights!
