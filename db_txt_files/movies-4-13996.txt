Matt Damon's coming out party is made even better by the presence of his pal Ben Affleck. Written by the two stars, Good Will's dialogue carries this movie to greatness. An awesome mix of mushy stuff and hard conflict, this star-filled movie delivers the goods. You like apples? You should see this film.
