O.K. maybe some of these negative ratings are left-over from seasons past... like the past 92 of them when the Cubbies were also-rans. But this year they're looking like the REAL deal. Both the starting and relief pitching is excellent, and with two HRs last night, I'm thinking that it's time for Sammy to go into one of his HR-hot streaks. The Cubs are 15 games over .500 as I'm writing this in June. I think they could be playoff bound, and with some of the best prospects in the minors it could be time for a Cubs DYNASTY... o.k. I'm getting ahead of myself, but still....
