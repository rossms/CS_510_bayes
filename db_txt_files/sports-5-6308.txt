Duke has one of the premiere basketball programs and a top notch coach in Coach K.I am a UNC fan, (strictly basketball) but not a fan of their typical secular humanist,left wing, multicultural university.Bluetarbaby you agreed to the site rules when you joined,if you can't get your comments across under the rules, that is your problem.You need to look up the word communist as well,UNC is alot closer to being communist than DUKE!
