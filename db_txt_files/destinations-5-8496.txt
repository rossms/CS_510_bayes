I was there once for the big UM-FSU rivalry (last year when Miami won in the last 30 seconds); wow - what a great place to watch football. The stadium losses something by not being on campus, but on the other hand there is lots of tailgating going on before and after, and so close to South Beach, Brickell, and Calle Ocho, the good restaurants abound for pre- and post- game celebrations!
