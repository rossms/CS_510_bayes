I thought this was a great movie (great as in entertaining, not epic or historically important.) It showed varying levels of conflict - old v. young, black v. white, coach v. player, etc. which made it even more interesting for me. I liked the loud in-your-face quality. I thought Ann Margret was perfect, and I really enjoyed Lawrence Taylor (his sauna scene was beautifully ironic given his real life situation.) Not to mention the locker room scenes! Ladies, even if you don't like football, it's worth $7.50 just for that - BELIEVE ME!!!
