Good Plenty is really getting trashed here! That's too bad because I think it's based more on the fact that people dislike black licorice than on the merits of the candy. I am a big fan of black licorice, and I really like Good Plenty. The sweet outer coating is the perfect balance to the bitter, chewy, black licorice inside. I admit that the colors leave a bit to be desired, but who cares? If you're a fan of black licorice, you'll probably agree with me.
