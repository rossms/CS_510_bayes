I really enjoyed this movie despite the gore. I almost threw up in the movie theater when Mr. Gladiator decided to maul his own arm to get rid of his Roman tattoo. The camera kept focusing in on this act, close-up, and the sound of him digging on his own arm was similar to a smacking, wet, jell-o sound. I had eaten waaaay too much butter-saturated popcorn and it was during this scene that I really started feeling sick. If you can get past the blood, guts, gore then you'll love this movie - I really enjoyed the action fight sequences. Russell Crowe is a beautiful, beautiful man. Meg Ryan, you go girl!
