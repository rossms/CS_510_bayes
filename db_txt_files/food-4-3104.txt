I really don't buy these babies too often, but usually around Thanksgiving is when they start appearing in our kitchen pantry. My mother always loves to make banana pudding. However, she's learned now that she has to buy more than one box because by the time I'm through with them, there won't be any cookies left for the banana pudding. They are espescially good with milk.
