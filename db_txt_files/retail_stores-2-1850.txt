The people in my Wal-Mart are rude, the store is a mess, and the lines are notoriously long. If someone says I have to run over to wal-mart they get rolling eyes and 'good luck! s! Seriously! Wal-Mart has the worst customer service! Great prices, but finally, I decided that I don't have time to wait in line there and I would rather pay a little extra for a more pleasant shopping experience elsewhere! At least they aren't quite as terrible as Ames.... But they are not a fun place to shop.
