A college safety and kick returner turned outside linebacker. And he sucked. Then an insightful member of the coaching staff decided to move Urlacher to middle linebacker, and look what has happened. By far the fastest linebacker in the NFL, he is also one of the hardest hitters. And you talk about drive and gamesmanship, and you have a recipe for the best player at Linebacker in the NFL. Ray Lewis is good, one of the best, but Urlacher just has better physical tools (speed) and that puts him over the top.
