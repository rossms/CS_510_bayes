Wow. After reading these I've seen 3 things come up; Mountains (beautiful view), Mormons, and Polygamy. I find it ironic and also quite humorous how people can go into a city, and always find something to whine and bitch about. "Can't find anything to drink", "Big house=Man with 5 wives", "mormons run the state". Quit BITCHING PEOPLE!
