Diet sprite is the best diet soft drink I have ever tried. If you prefer to drink diet drinks without caffiene, this is the best one. I have been hooked on it for over a year now. It tastes much better than diet 7UP, and much much better than diet coke or diet pepsi. I have a hard time finding it in stores sometimes which is a big disappointment. As long as diet sprite is on the shelves then I am buying it!
