Tough Philadelphia Catholic School guard who plays fearlessly in the Big East for Villanova. He must be an Iverson fan because he takes the ball to the Hoop like AI. Can really play the game, but drops a star for throwing a jab punch against a Kansas player his freshamn year in a Nationally televised game. He was rightfully thrown out of the game.
