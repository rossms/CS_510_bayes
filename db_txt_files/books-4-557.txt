Dr.Suess always had the talent for coming up with such imaginative books. The Cat In The Hat was one of the first read by myself books as a child. A charming tale about a Huge cat that can talk and comes to visit a brother and sister left alone while mom is out shopping. He causes all kinds os trouble and makes a mess of the house. A very cute book where Dr. Suess comes up with all his unusual characters the cat brings with him. I bet most people have heard of the Cat In The Hat. I imagine it has been translated into a lot of different languages.
