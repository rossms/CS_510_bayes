Incredibly pleasing to drive, very agile in every direction of maneuvering, very well engineered, and very attractive. Wherever I drive this car I get compliments and inquiries from pedestrians; a lot of the local school kids even give it a cheer when I drive by. But best of all, driving it feels absolutely superb. It's more fun than all other cars I've owned, even the '65 L78 Corvette.
