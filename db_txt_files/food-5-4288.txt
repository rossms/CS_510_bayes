Bugles are great. I always forget that these things exist, but when I happen to see them at the grocery store I'm usually quick to buy a box. As a kid my favorite way to eat them was with one of those squeeze-cans of cheese - just fill up the hole in each unhealthy, artificial Bugle with some unhealthy, artificial cheese and down one after another... It's a wonder I'm not obese.
