I cringe as I give Barry 5 stars, but I have to. He sees the ball better than anyone in the league. I truly believe he'd dominate the game without the help of steroids. That said, he lost my respect as a person when he recently made the claim that he was unknowingly taking performance-enhancing drugs. He's basically calling everyone in the game and every fan of the game a moron.
