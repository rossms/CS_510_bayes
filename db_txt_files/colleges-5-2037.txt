Hard to believe how this university maintains its greatness with over 50,000 students. Offers so much in all areas: a multitude of undergraduate programs, a great graduate program, and a first-rate law school. The collegiate atmosphere is first-rate, it's steeped in tradition, and Austin is one of the best, if not the best, college town in America.
