I can't believe people actually like their burgers. Then again, it could just be that they suck here in New Jersey. I liked it when Wendy's had their buffet bar, but now that it's back to just burgers (mainly), I have to admit I completely pass them by. I would much rather have a Fuddrucker's or a Checkers burger. WAAAAAAY too greasy.
