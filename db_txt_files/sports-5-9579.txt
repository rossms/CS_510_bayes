I didn't expect this team to win 60+ games. They're probably the team to beat in the West. They're a great running team and Steve Nash, Shawn Marion and Amare Stoudamire are playing like MVP's. ... Too bad that they'll have homecourt advantage throughout the playoffs because they are such a great road team.
