JEOLUSY[however its spelled] is what it seems like to me after reading any anti-cowboy or anti-yankee messsages. Im not a Cowboy fan,Im an Atlanta Falcon fan and I wish we would have been in one half as many SuperBowls as Dallas has.Its strange but about 99% of the Cowboy haters Ive met over the years have never strapped on the gear,lined up and participated in a real football game.Im not a Dallas fan,but their tradition,number of exciting games,past heroes{too many to name)and sales of team merchandise are second to none.Even this year.
