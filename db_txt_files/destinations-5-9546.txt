If you visit london, you just have to visit buckingham palace before you go home. When i was a kid and went to london with my mum and dad, i use to stand at the gates and imagine the queen having tea inside. Its a lovely site as you stand in the mall and look up to see it. The changing of the guard is pretty good, if you get a good view as it can get quite crowded. Now they have opened the doors to part of the palace for the public to see.
