I've watched Tony Geary since I was a kid. I saw the episodes where he raped Laura. I saw the aftermath. Tony is a good actor. To make almost every female viewer fall in love with Luke after what his character did takes talent. I believe it also takes an enormous amount of talent for a gay man to act straight, which he does with tremendous believability. My only wish is that he worked more and could truly convince Genie Francis to once again step back into the role of Laura.
