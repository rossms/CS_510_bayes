gale sayers is the best running back ever without question. he had moves that have never been done before or since. he was so fluid and quick that no one could stop him. unlike most running backs he would only carry the ball maybe 10-15 times a game where as others carry it 25 -30 times and posted the same numbers. the game when he scored six touchdowns he only ran the ball 9 times and did all that by the third quarter. what else can you call him but the best?
