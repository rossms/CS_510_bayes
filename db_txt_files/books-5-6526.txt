Thank Goodness for The Kingdoms and the Elves! Let me say that I finished reading the last book today and a horrible thought came to mind, this might be the last one. Then I found out there was more and I was the happiest person in the world! Each book in the series is absolutely amazing, each getting jucier than the previous. It is a wonderful imaginative series EVERYONE should take the time to read. Absolutely amazing, the 4th book had me laughing, worried, completely dumbfounded, and even crying as these characters seem so real you can't help but feel their pain.
