Very good. Little too long though. And I don't care who did it. All I know is, I want to beat that one kid's dad face in - the country singer/christian/obvious ridiculous person. I don't know if he did it or not, but he damn sure did something to someone at some point in his life. It seems like he would've killed them, yet the evidence is so overwhelming against the teens. ? Good movie.
