I've owned two Panasonic SL Series CD players and both were reliable and had good pick-up. Although one of them was much more pricey, both basically had the same chassis. The cheaper one seemed the same compared to the other (SL-5231C vs. SL-5280). The Panasonic has a better design compared to a Sony or a Phillips. Panasonics use little batteries.
