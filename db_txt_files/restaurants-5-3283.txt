As a college student, I've eaten Papa John's many, many times. I'd have to say that the pizza is okay, although they seem to skimp on the cheese; you have to order extra cheese just to get some cheese on the pizza. Next is the toppings....my favorites are ground beef, italian sausage and pepperoni. I usually order extra garlic sauce and eat the crust....it's like built-in breadsticks! You can't beat the prices either--the Papa's here has a large one-topping for $5.99. That's pretty cheap. I'd say if you want some cheapo pizza that'll be there in less than 15 minutes, Papa's is the way to go.
