I used Enterprise when my car was in the shop and I found their customer service to be great, and the price was reasonable. While I had the rental, a stray cat climbed under my hood, and got stuck in the fan belt. I had to call animal control and eventually had to cut the belt. Enterprise had no problem picking up the expense of having the belt replaced, which was a nice relief. However, I don't think the cat was feeling too good for the few remaining hours of its life.
