I absolutely love Arizona Green Tea. I especially like the one with Gingseng and Honey. These teas are refreshing to me unlike soda's which can be bloating. The Arizona Green Tea will really quench your thirst! I highly recommend you give this product a try. It must have antioxidants because I can drink this tea and feel good and have a lot more energy.
