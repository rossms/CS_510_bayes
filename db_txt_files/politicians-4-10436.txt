People yell and cry Bush a war monger, but let's see at what he's done compared to the previous Leader of the Free World. Just off the top of my head, I can think of the whole Croatia incident, Iraq *yeah, he attacked them as well, but I didn't hear liberals crying then, and several African operations. All that with no 9-11. Bush has had a rough start to his term, but he's handled it better than I ever expected he could.
