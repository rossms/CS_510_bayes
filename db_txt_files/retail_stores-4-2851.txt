I have bought a ton of jewelry from Whitehalls at Town Center, Ga. Literally spent thousands. I buy because of their proactive service. Rob has been my jeweler for years. He always goes the extra mile, makes suggestions and help with selection. He knows me by my foirst name, calls me when they have specials. You get what you pay for. I have been to every jeweler in the area. They all have pretty much the same inventory. The difference to me is in the customer service. That is why I will always go back. Never had a problem with returns, resizing or quality.
