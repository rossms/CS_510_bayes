I think of Squirt as one of about three good alternatives I buy occasionally when I suffer from cola burn-out. It is similar to 7up in that it is a lemon-lime combination but with a stronger, fruitier taste. It is really a lot like one of the old Canada Dry sodas some may be able to recall called Wink.
