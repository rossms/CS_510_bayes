After trying this a few times since 1999 at various locations, my impression is that the food is pre-cooked and pre-packaged, so it tastes like that. Poor quality control allows the sandwich to be literally thrown together, no matter if dining in or out. The cleanliness (qat least in the Southern establishments I have been to ) is lacking. The Sonic chicken sandwich is well worth the money...this one is not. The only positive about this "restaurant" is that they are closed on Sunday to give all staff a day of worship and reflection. Very disappointing over the years...
