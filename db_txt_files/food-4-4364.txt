My doctor says I shouldn't eat them. My wife says they smell bad. They make my fingers greasy and I smear up everything I touch. But, I love them. I love the original best, but I like the Scoops because Fritos taste best when you dip something with them. I dip salsa mostly, but dipping cheese is very good too. I figure that sooner or later something will kill you, and it might as well be a Frito.
