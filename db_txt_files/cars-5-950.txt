I've owned a 1989 Civic DX and currently own an 1997 Accord LX. The Civic never let me down, although when it got to be nine or ten years old, the electrical system got a little funny. The gas tank finally rotted out after 11 years and 140K miles, which is the only reason I got rid of it. The Accord has been great - not a lick of major trouble, just a new muffler and brakes every two years because I live in a state that uses salt and cars rot out very fast. The Accord is seven years old and has only one small spot of rust. I would heartily recommend this brand of car.
