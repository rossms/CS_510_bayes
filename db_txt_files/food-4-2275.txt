I really like Twix. Everything about it is great and put it together and you can't go wrong. The cookie which offers a great texture and a solid bottom. The sweet layer of carmel to soften up the cookie, and the perfect chocolate covering makes it a great candy bar. You can tell yourself that you'll just eat one of the two skinny bars that come in a package, but good luck. They are so good, it is hard to stop at one.
