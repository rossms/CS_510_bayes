I love Q3 Arena!! I used to play Q2 which was awesome. But Q3 is even better! It's a really fast, challenging game. Especially with the grappling hook add on. I also love playing in a Loaded mod server. It's non-stop fun and guts and killing. Where else can you kill people violently without a criminal penalty? LOL. Quake 3 will always be my favorite PC game. It rules! If you play multiplayer games, look for me. I'm -DC,JD-YerMomsButt and I'll be happy to kick your butt all over the map. Or have fun trying at least. :D
