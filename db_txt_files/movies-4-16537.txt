I wouldn't necessarily call this movie a drama, but it was excellent nonetheless. The serious side of the movie paints a story about the importance of family and community, while the comedic side entertains with clever dialogue and characters. Barbershop is a very lighthearted movie that puts me in a good mood whenever I watch it.
