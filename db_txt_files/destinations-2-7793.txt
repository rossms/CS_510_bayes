Talk about a tourist trap. The boat is not even the original boat from the Boston Tea Party and it is very small, yet they still charge around $7 just to go on it. They give you your own tea to throw over the ship into Boston Harbor, but then they just real it right back up into the boat. It's really pretty cheesy. They took a famous event in history and one that many people think of when they think of Boston, and did a poor job of making it an attraction. Plus it is far away from all other attractions in Boston. Not worth going to!
