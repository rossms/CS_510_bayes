I just love the atmosphere of Barnes and Noble. For such a nationwide chain, they have still managed to keep that peaceful, comfortable feel to their stores. The colors and music are soothing and inviting. As for the selection of books, it is generally well-rounded and the price is never outlandish. I can understand why some people never seem to leave. Plus our area store has an instore Starbucks...how can you get more enjoyable than that?
