I personally like Al Sharpton. I think he is outspoken and rightfully so. He has been fighting for human rights since I can remember, and I say human rights because I do not think it just for blacks or minorities. I feel that if all people were treated fairly there would be no race issue. The constitution states we have inalienable rights and that all men are created equal but in practice the people with money possess the power. I think Al Sharpton is spokesman for many of us.
