Tom Hanks' narrative is the glue which binds this excellent film together. It was interesting as a foreigner to view this movie as such is the impact of American culture on our lives that every scene seemed familiar. This is also due to the basic human issues we see such as love, innocence, childhood, war and peace. The honesty with which Forrest lives his life is something we all should strive for.
