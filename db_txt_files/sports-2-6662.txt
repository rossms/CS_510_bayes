Lucky...had the the best player if not phenom in the league in Jordan, and Pippen easily in the top 5. With the Lakers, none of that has changed...Shaq, the best player if no phenom in the league and Kobe, the second best if not the best player in the league...most decent coaches could have accomplished what he has if they had this kind od talent to build around.
