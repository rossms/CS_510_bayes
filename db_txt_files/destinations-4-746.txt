Stockholm is a great place to visit, strung over many islands and parks, crystal blue waters everywhere. A lighter feel than some of the other Scaninavian capitals. As for the country, feels a bit provincial, and staid compared to say, Denmark, but that's because it's bigger and less populated. Good looking friendly people earn stars too.
