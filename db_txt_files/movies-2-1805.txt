So disappointing. Tommy Lee Jones, who is such a great actor, is wasted in this lousy film. Jones is given about the same role he had in The Fugitive, with Ashley Judd serving in Harrison Ford's Fugitive role. But this movie is nowhere near as good as The Fugitive. I wouldn't even recommend this as a rental.
