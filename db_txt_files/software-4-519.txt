A great tool, (though I could really do without the auto-formatting and the bossy little paperclip guy in the corner of my screen--it's a good thing I can turn the helper off, it's when I go to other computers to work on, and POOF, he's there again!) This program is very versatile, and if you take the time, you can create almost any type of document using this program. And, I agree with CastleBee--Mary Shelley wrote Frankenstein around 1816, died in 1851. I'd imagine she would use Word if she had it, though.
