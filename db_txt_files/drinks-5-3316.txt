Best 'non-sweet' cider I've experienced. It is called Bulmer's in Ireland & Magner's outside of the island. Dark, dry & a hint of peanut around the top. If you don't fancy typical American sweet cider at all, then search out this brand. Sadly, it is not available everywhere in the US, so call your local & have them ask the distributor!
