I recently had reason to listen to this CD to test out this email story about how, if you start DSOTM right after the MGM lion roars at the start of Wizard of Oz, a bunch of amazing coincidences happen. It's very much true -- every dramatic shift in mood in the movie coincides with a spooky change in the album, lots of lyrics seem to describe what's going on in the film, and the CD fades out with a heartbeeat as Dorothy puts her hand on the Tin Man's chest. Pretty freaky, but it's about the only reason why I'd ever think of playing this pretensious piece of crap.
