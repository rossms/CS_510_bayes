lmbo, Roswellfan! (adding on to what jeffrey715 said,) you should name your handyman EWWWWWW!. (For those of you who have never played RCT, handymen are your workers who clean up the vomit on your paths.) This game was even better than the first! I've found the banners to be quite useful, the guests' names give them personality, and the new rides are the best! The reason why a whole LOT wasn't changed is because there wasn't much to improve upon the original.
