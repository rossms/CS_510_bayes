Great, addicting, chewy, fruity, tasty, gob of gustatory fun. Hard on the outside but soft to chew as it transforms from the hard shell into the slightly crunchy (at first from the shells) taffy-like mouth watering gob of pure candy: Skittles are good and Skittles are FUN!. Try the sour ones for an extra zing.
