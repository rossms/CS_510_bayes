With the exception of Document, I'm a pretty big fan of all REM CDs, including this one. But unfortunately it contains Shiny Happy People, far and away the most annoying song REM has ever produced. And Losing My Religion has been played to death on the radio, making it almost impossible to listen to. On the other hand, this CD includes Half a World Away, one of REM's best songs. So Out of Time runs hot and cold for me, but the great music outweighs the not-so-great.
