The Tower of London was a great place to visit in London. There is so much history revolving around the place, and there are plenty of things to see that will interest everyone. It is also very wide open on the grounds, and I didn't feel rushed or cramped like in many museums. This would definitely top my list of things to see in London if I had to reccomend anything to visitors.
