5 solid stars for coming in with the rest of the world and ridding themselves of thier WMD's. Lybia is strong evidence that Bush's policy of in in-your-face attitude is working. Lybia got scarred that we could attack them, and decided to lay down thier arms. I wouldn't be suprised if more countries like Lybia gave in to us before we had to use force. Sure, Qaddafi is still a murderer/terrorist, but now he has no weapons to hijack the world with.
