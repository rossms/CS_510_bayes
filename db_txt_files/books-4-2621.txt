Must-have for all computer science students and professionals alike, even if your university or curriculum doesn't emphasize C++. My first copy got so worn out in school I had to replace it. Since Soustrup is the original architect of C++, it pays to get his insight into the design of the language, where it's going, and why some things were done the way they were. Highly recommended.
