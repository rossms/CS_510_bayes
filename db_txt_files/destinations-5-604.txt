this is a diverse beautiful city that shines in the caribbean. people are afraid of the violence but this only exists in the inner city. i mean even in every u.s. city there are ghettos more dangerous so please.kingston has buildings from the 18th and 19th centuries but also has her towering high rises .it is definately one of the caribbeans most beautiful cities.and you cant beat the shopping that is so great there.
