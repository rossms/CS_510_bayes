The most under-rated player in the world. He's number 2 in OPS. with a 1.063(behind bonds) has 28 homers, 69 RBI's, he's batting .300 and his SLG is .631! I mean come on people, he should at least be in the top 20! And all of this is on a bad team! I bet he'd have like 20 more RBI's if people would get on base infront of him more. This is all in 103 games and 350 AB's
