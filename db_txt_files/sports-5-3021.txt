a staggering hitter. was the only person who got 100+ walks, 200+ hits, 30 hrs, 125+ rbi, and 120+ runs a yearly thing. as far as being the greatest rbi man, im not sure about, because well, look who he had batting in front of him. thats right, the king of crash, who seemingly, was always on base. he was a great guy personally. obviously had a great work ethic. great speed, he had something around 200 career triples
