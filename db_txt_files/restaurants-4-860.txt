I eat out at Subway quite often, usually with a great pride of eating healthy. Subway 12 sub beats any burger, taco, or deep-fried anything. However I was wondering about the quality of their meats. They used processed meats, and I was told it's the bottom of the barrel. That left a bad taste in my mouth. ANYONE can share what quality meat they use at Subway???? No opinions, I am looking for facts, list web sites or other sources where you get your information from. Thanks.
