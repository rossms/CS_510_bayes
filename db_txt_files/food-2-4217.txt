I'll rate this one item on this list, even though I think I had it only once. I was amazed while looking over the list that I have either never had any of the stuff on this list (except for just a couple of items), or, for those items I have had, I haven't had any in years. It's all pretty much junk, but I guess I'm in a minority holding that opinion. The reason I chose to rate Poppycock is so that I could also throw out another piece of worthless trivia. Somewhere or other I read that the word poppycock is derived from Dutch, and means soft sh*t. So, poppycock on all of the snack foods!
