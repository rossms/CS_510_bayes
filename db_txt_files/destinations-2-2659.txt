Chicago isn't bad per se, but not really good. I find the people there to be rude and unwelcoming. The city does offer lots to do though...as does any major city. Lots of cultural activities and some great food... I just have a hard time w/ the fact that a lot of Chicagans (sp?) think they are better than everyone else.
