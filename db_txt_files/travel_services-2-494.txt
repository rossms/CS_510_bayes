The airport in Frankfurt is clean and provides the infrastructure (restaurants, shopping) you would expect in an airport of that size. Security staff is - not always but by far too often - unfriendly. Unfortunately, you will normally have to walk long distances for your connecting flight. Clearly substandard is Frankfurt's smoking policy: smoking areas are every 10 meters which means the whole airport stinks. I couldn't find any restaurant/bar with a no-smoking area.
