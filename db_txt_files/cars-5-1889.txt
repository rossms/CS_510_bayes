Just bought an '03 in Sept., to date it has been the best compact car I have ever owned. I did my home work before buying & in my opinion it beat the Civic, Sentra & all others in it's class. The price is right & you can't beat the warranty, in fact I like it so much that when I'm ready to trade (sell) my 98 Olds Intrigue (because GM was stupid enough to pull the line)I'm looking at the full size Sonata, hay for $25,000 that is one nice & well pacted car. Buy now because you know the way this car is selling in a few years the price will go up & the warranty down (?). Take the steal now, way to Hyundai
