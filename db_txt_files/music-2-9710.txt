This album reminds me too much of Wallflowers. Another horrible band. This is radio music. Radio Music is the type that is on the radio and no one has any kind of real opinion about it. You get it stuck in your head, you know the words because they are stupid and easy to remember. Then you just assume you like it because you know the words but then realize it is embarassing you know the words and you turn off the radio. This album is a perfect example.
