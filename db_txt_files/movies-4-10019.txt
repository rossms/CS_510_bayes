I just loves Sister Act.! Whoopi Goldberg was good as the Vegas singer who has to go in hiding after witnessing a murder. She ends up in a convent donning a nun's habit.She is way out of her element here until she ends up directing the nuns choir. she turns them from awful to a great choir. It draws in new parishoners. Soon the bad guys find her and the other nuns help out. A real likable movie.some good songs to that come from the 60s. such as I will Follow Him. and My Guy.
