Okay, first of all...Keith Langford does NOT play for Kentucky! He plays for the KANSAS JAYHAWKS! Anyways, Keith is awesome. He is really gonna be something huge. He's got talent that can take him a long way. Being only a sophomore with two all american seniors on his team this year, Keith wasn't really in the spotlight a lot. But he was huge for Kansas. He's great at penetrating and he can find amazing ways to get around his defenders and get the ball in the bucket. He's definately gonna be a great leader on the court next year.
