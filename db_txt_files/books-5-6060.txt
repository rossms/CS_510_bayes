This book is another amazing one by Crichton. Crichton, using his old tons-of-information-on-the-subject trademark, takes the reader on a wild adventure through the Congo rain forest. Many people do not know that Amy is based on a real gorilla called Koko. Anyway, I think this has got to be Crichton's second best novel(right behind Jurassic Park). I reccomend it to anyone who enjoyed JP or Sphere, or has an interest in gorillas or the rain forest.
