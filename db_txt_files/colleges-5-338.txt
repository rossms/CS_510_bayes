The big advantage of the OUBS is the vast amount of academic material you receive and work with. This has the addtional benefit of providing you with an extensive reference library that you can always refer to when you need to refresh your memory on something. The residential schools are really exciting and the academic standard is extremely high. The materials are extremely up-to-date and the use of the team principle in preparing the 'lectures' means you get a very broad range of expertise. It was such a great experience, I wish I were still doing it!
