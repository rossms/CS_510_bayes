YUMMY!! i love thier donuts!!! I had some on my way to columbus today and they were very good! I love the selection and I love the glazed ones, they taste better than riesbecks and others. They are so glazy and good! mmmmm. I had 3 of them and I wanted more but my dad only bought a few and he had 2 of them and my bro had 1 and he gave me his other one. I wish you can get the krispy creme do-nuts where I live you have to drive 30 miles away to get those kind of donuts. oh well they are good dounts and I love the glazed ones.
