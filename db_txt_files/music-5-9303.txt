I love Crazy*Town b4 Butterfly came out. But this song got them big. I am so happy for them. This song is so addicting! I love this song. I love Crazy*Town. I mean,a lot of diversity. Plyaed on heavy metal stations, alternative, pop/alternative stations, and even rap stations! Also, the cd is great.
