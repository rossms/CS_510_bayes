 Speed was definately one hell of an action film. It was pretty typical, but most action films are I guess. It had me on the edge of my seat throughout the entire film- espescially with the close calls of the bus slowing below 50 MPH. A pretty typical action film, but it was definately a fun ride, no pun intended. However, what the hell was that sequel about?
