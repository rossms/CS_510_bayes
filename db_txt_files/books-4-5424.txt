I liked this book it was sweet and sad and it touches your heart just like the movie but I read this book first and then I went to go see the movie it was rather different but it still tells the story. It is about a girl named Jamie who believes in god and she is always carrying around her bible. And people put her down because of the way she dresses and acts but she ends up with the bad boy . The book is a tearjerker just like the movie but, If you like romance/ sweet easy reading books you will like A Walk To Remember.
