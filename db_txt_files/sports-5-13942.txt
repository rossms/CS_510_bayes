Barry Sanders is the greatest back of all time because he didn't have an offensive line that could block for him like the Cowboys and he still made it to just 1400 yds away from the record. He is also the best because he was the most exciting athlete to watch in the 90's, I wish he didn't walk away from the game early and we wouldn't have to be here defending him.
