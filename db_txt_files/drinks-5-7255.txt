I recently was given a bottle ofThree Olive vodka. The martinis were excellent . We had several other brands; ie Grey Goose , Belvedere , Kettle One. I would say Three Olive Vodka makes an ecellent martini which is on the same plane as the best. I have since bought several more bottles , and given some as gifts. It is very smooth and has a wonderful taste. Three Olive has now taken over as my favorite . Try it.
