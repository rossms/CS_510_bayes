This observation is particulaly for coach Cowher...The use of timeouts before halftime when the Steelers do not have the ball but we do have the lead is just asking for trouble as you found out again this past Sunday. Let's get the team into halftime and some rest instead of trying to score more points and putting pressure on our offense when it is not necessary.
