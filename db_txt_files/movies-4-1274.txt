A combination of violence and comedy was always going to be hard to pull off. That is why Pulp Fiction is very refreshing. The direction shows the skill of Quentin Tarrintino in character illustraion and scriptwriting. The dialogue and narration is funny and engaging and builds up an empathy with characters. The plot is witty, with the cast all putting in good performances. A film worth seeing if just for sheer entertainment.
