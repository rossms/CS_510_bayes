You must be a fool not to give this book five stars. Either that or a real Agatha Christie fan not wanting to give Mr. Crichton any credit. This book is almost as good as Jurassic Park, probably Crichtons second or third best. I really think this one deserves five. Crichton throw out detail at you in this one like he never has before......well like he always does actually. If you have'nt read it yet go out and buy it or rent it. Its worth a good couple of hours of page-turning.
