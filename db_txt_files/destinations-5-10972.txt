Hershey is one of the greatest parks that I have been to, they have a ton of rides that are great for everyone in the family. Their newest coaster StormRunner, which now brings their collection of coasters to TEN, is my favorite roller coaster ever! It shoots you staraight up and straight down, through a loop and inversions all at 72 mph. They have a lot of great rides that you won't find at any other park, not to mention the availability of great Hersheys chocolate at almost every shop you turn to.
