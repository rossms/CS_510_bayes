Always second best Compared to the Super Nintendo system out the same time as the Genesis....The Genesis has really good sports games over the Super Nintendo, but that is about it.....The sonic line was alot of fun too... The controller is too bulky , Sega never did make a good controller, oh well.....Genesis is still a fun system.
