WHERE'S THE BEEF? (LOL!!!!) I ordered a Kid's cheese burger for myself this evening. Oh man, I couldn't stop laughing!! The patty was so thin, I could see through it! LOL !! Literally, it had holes in it! LOL The patty was as thin as the cheese! LOL!! What's next? Will they paint a thin layer of Beef Gravy on the bun!? LOL!! Wendy's.....I'm embarrassed for you! LOL
