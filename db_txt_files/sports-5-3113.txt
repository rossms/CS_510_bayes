Mays not only excelled in the fundamental areas of hitting, fielding, throwing, and baserunning, he transcended expectations by catching balls that others would play off the fence, advancing from first base to third or home on hits that would have convinced most players to remain at second. If Mays had not missed 270 games early in his career, he probably would have hit another 60 homeruns, for a total of 720, would have had nearly 3600 hits, and would have batted in more than 2050.
