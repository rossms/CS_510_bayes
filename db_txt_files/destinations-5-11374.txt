I personally pefer the nearby Bryce Canyon, but Zion is very beautiful too. And the best part is that this park is very accessible. Fly to Vegas cheap, rent a car and be at ZIon in about 2 hours. Even seniors can experience this park very well. There are buses and wel paved falt trails. Almost all hotels you stay at are covered all the war around with breathtaking scenries. You'll take one your best photographs here.
