The overall atmosphere of this game is so overwhelming that you could heal yourself spiritually just playing this game through. Mind you the only thing i didn't like about this game was the lack of flexibility in exploration- But i hear this is changing in X-2. The ending was also kind of unexpected with its introduction of melancholy but extremely emotional. Overall, this game travels along the lines of the idea of the diffusion between dreams and reality- and does a good job in captivating the player.
