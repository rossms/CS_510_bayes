I was so glad when Israel finally kicked that fool Bibi Netanyahu out of office and let Barak, a good person, take his place. Bibi was a complete lunatic, did nothing to stop Arafat from yanking the throats out of his people (by the way, I've completely given up on Arafat. Netanyahu sat back and watched the holy whatever wars go on, and life is not a spectator sport. Nor is death, for that matter. He and Ronald Reagan would be friends. Reagan was one of our worst, Bibi was one of their worst!
