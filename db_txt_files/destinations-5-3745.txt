As a new resident of Austin, I consider myself extremely fortunate. Here we have a city that, even with all the good press it's received in the last few years, is still vastly under-rated. Job growth has slowed but is still impressive, the people are the friendliest anywhere, the weather is generally good (except for June-Sept), cultural and educational opportunities are plentiful, and the scenery is simply gorgeous. Plus, you get all this without a lot of typical big-city hassles. I highly recommend Austin for students, visitors, and newcomers alike.
