I m not a big fan of either Adam Sandler or Drew Barrymore, so I was pleasantly surprised when I ended up enjoying this movie. The Wedding Singer doesn t set out to be anything groundbreaking it s just a simple story about a nice guy who likes a girl who likes a jerk. But it s funny, Adam Sandler is really good as the goofy guy you root for, and everything moves along at a good pace. Plus you get a Billy Idol cameo. This isn t a movie you ll be thinking about for weeks after you see it, but it s harmless and easy to like.
