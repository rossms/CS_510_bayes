He was no saint, and no rocket scientist. Couldn't jump over the Sunday paper or run the 100 in less than 15 seconds. But, he worked harder than anyone in the league and made everyone around him play better, and he made his team better. He could shoot, pass, and rebound with anyone in NBA history. He is the most clutch player of all time and is one of the 3 best overall of all time. To say otherwise is ridiculous.
