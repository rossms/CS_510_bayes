Poor Grant was a good military leader, but a bad president. This is the case with most military people who become politicans. They have a hard time understanding fiscal policy or foreign policy. In the case of Grant, he didn't know that his own people were doing monkey business underneath his own nose. He was an ineffective president, but a good, not great, military leader during the Civil War.
