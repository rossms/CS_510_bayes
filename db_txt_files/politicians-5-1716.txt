Now that the '04 race is over, I would love to see Bill Richardson run for the Democratic nomination in '08. His credentials are impecable - Congressman, Ambassador to the U.N., Cabinet Member, Governor and four time nominee for the Nobel Peace Prize! He would mobilize the Hispanic vote and take New Mexico, Arizona, Nevada, Colorado and Florida. He could even put Texas back into play for the Democrats!
