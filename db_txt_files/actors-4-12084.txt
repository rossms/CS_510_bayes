Winona already has quite an extensive filmography, and she is only 30 or so, right?! Amazing versatility from Heathers and Lucas to Girl, Interrupted. She was also the perfect portrayal of Joe in Little Women as the independent and strong tomboy turned author. She is believable as a cute young girl as well as deeper characters. An all around great actress.
