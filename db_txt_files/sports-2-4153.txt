Hmmm, Rupp is a racist for openly not playing black players, but Thompson can do the same thing, and if it's pointed out, people like Ninobene will accuse you of spouting hate... Interesting...Getting back on topic, as a coach, he's ok, nothing special. If he was as good as the ever loving media lets on, he would have at least three national championships. Seeing how many out there feel the media knows all, he's overrated and only deserves a two. There ya go.
