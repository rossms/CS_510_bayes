I actually visited the theater near my house to see another movie, but got stuck with seing this one. I didn't mind too much, however, because Heath Ledger was in it and I knew he was really a good actor. Well, it turns out I loved the movie. I loved how they mixed in the old times and the times of knights with today's modern music and language. The whole idea was very creative, and all in all..I can truly say, I did not waste 6 bucks to go see this movie!
