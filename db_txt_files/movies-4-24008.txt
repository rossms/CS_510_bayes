This was a fairly good movie. Haley Joel Osment was good at playing David, The boy robot programmed to love. He goes out to find the Blue Fiary to turn him into a real boy after hearing the tale Pinocchio. David couldn't eat because if he did, He would break down. Teddy, the bear who could move and talk was my favorite character throughout the movie. another great film made by Steven Spielberg. The only reason why I gave this movie a 4 is because the movie was a little too long. but still a great movie worth seeing.
