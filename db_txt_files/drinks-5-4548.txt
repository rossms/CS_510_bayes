The best cola on the market. Pepsi is just a poor, flat-tasting imitation. Whenever I go to a restaurant that does not offer Coke, I just get a root beer instead. That's how much I like Coke and dislike Pepsi. Coke also has the best soda lineup, with Barq's root beer and Sprite being among them. I think they make Aquafina water, too, which is my favorite water drink (esp. the new Flavor Splash). Whether with or without sugar and caffeine, Coke products will always be the best choice! Coke Classic is just that, a classic soft-drink, delicious and satisfying!
