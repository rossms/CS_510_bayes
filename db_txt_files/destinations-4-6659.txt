West Virginia is an amazingly beautiful state. I drove from one end to the other (Kentucky-Maryland) and it was like a rollercoaster ride as the entire drive was up and down with hills and mountains. The vegetation there is amazingly green and lush. Lots of friendly folks (a lot more inviting than Kentucky) and quite a bit of character as much of the state seemed to be a throwback in time. I did see a few areas with very striking poverty but for the most part I really enjoyed West Virginia.
