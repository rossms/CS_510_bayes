All of that crap on the walls... I feel like they hired a team of psychologists to concoct a conglomeration of items that will deliver subliminal messages to all who cast their gaze upon it. They serve an alcoholic drink made predominantly of oreos. One of the more surreal experiences of my life was eating at a Friday's in Prague. Our booth had Minnesota Twins memorabilia embedded in the table. Someday, someone is going to expose a terrible secret about the Friday's corporation... I'm certain of it.
