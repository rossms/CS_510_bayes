I just purchased a 2000 GT and can say that it is a blast. With 260hp and torque to spare it makes you smile every time you turn the key. For a fully loaded functional sports car for under 23K this one cant be beat!! Check it's acceleration vs other cars that cost much much more !! (5.5 sec 0-60) Fit and finish for the 99-00 models are excellent. previous cars I have owned include an Integra and Eagle Talon Turbo AWD. The Mustang will eat those for lunch :)
