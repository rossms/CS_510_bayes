It was horrible to see a great actor like Gene Hackman star in this travesty of a movie. It elicited about as many laughs as a wet paper bag. Ray Romano was uncharacteristically bad, completely lacking in humor. The supporting actors tried but couldn't overcome the stinking material. Not worth renting.
