Hosni Mubarak is a great arab leader. When he came to power he had to face the embargo by the arabs on egypt after the 1979 peace agreement with Isreal. Egypt was more stable under his rule more than any other president since the revolution in 1953. He is a great supporter of the Palestinian cause, despite any rumors.
