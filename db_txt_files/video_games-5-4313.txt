One of the very few computer games that actually has appealed to me; and it is quite enjoying indeed. Being a bit of a hacker, however, I couldn't resist figuring out how to do some creative accounting (isn't that what we all use hex editors for?) Caution: this game turns sane, decent human beings into Republicans.
