Al Gore conceded the night of the election. Why does that not carry any weight????? He threw in the towel!!! If one throws in the towel, the fight is over!!! Give it up Al! you lost! You gave up! You are making a mockery of the U.S.A.!!!!! The whole world is laughing at us because of you. I pray that God himself will help G.W. Bush prevail through this mess.
