Great hiking in the North Cascades -- incredibly beautiful, and it's possible to walk for weeks without seeing a road. The Olympic peninsula, too, is wonderful -- it's a rainforest, and things grow so fast there that despite heavy use, many of the trails are permanently covered with moss. Needless to say, bring good raingear.
