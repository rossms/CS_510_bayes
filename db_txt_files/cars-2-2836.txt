Terrible? That's a little harsh. I can think of worse cars. Although when I test drove one in 99, I was not pleased at all. They're just nothing like they used to be when I was driving them year after year back in the 80's. I do miss those days though.. my favorite thing about them was the sound of them when down shifting!
