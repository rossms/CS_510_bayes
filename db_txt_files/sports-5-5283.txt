Hank was an unbelievable athlete known as the strongest man in the world . Played the pivot at 6'7 and saw him give 44 points and 20+ rebounds to Shaq and Stanly Roberts, two 7'0 300lb. players in one of the greatest college games I've ever seen. Relentless rebounder and competitor. There are many of us who will never forget him.
