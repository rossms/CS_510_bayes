I've watched every UF coach since Ray Graves and Ron Zook ranks up there with the best. He may not have Spurrier's win % yet but give him a chance. I think his teams and game strategies are much better balanced than Spurrier's. At least Zook realizes that there are other players besides QB's and Receivers. UF kept Pell for five years after a winless season. Roon Zook deserves better
