What a view! You won't see anything like this park anywhere. The hoodoos are breathtaking. ANd the best part is that the canyon is very accessible. The trails are easy and you can experince the best parts of the park via a simple 1 hour trail. Just be there in June-August. Also this park is very easy to access. Fly to Vegas cheap, rent a car and be there in about 4 hours. Drive to the park from Vegas is one the best I have seen. You can do Bryce, Zion and North Rim of Grand Canyon, in about 3-4 days, if you are short on time, as most people are.
