The sand is white and the water is clear blue - it looks like paradise. The people are very friendly, we chatted it up with all the cab drivers and locals. There is a lot to do during the day, with a casino close by and plenty of places to jet ski, snorkel, or go tubing. We went on a booze cruise where they ran out of mixers and starting making drinks with straight alcohol - like peach schnapps and vodka. Bad move. The trip was a bit more expensive than Cancun or Jamaica but also less shady.
