Haven't seen this in a while- first Bond movie ever made, I believe. The quality isn't the best, but it's got excitement. The theme song is worth listening to- all of the James Bond movie theme songs are kind of silly- because the movies are based on books, the songwriters had to work with the titles and plots and create a mysterious-sounding song. Take the Diamonds are Forever theme- Diamonds are forever/ They are all I need to please me/ They can stimulate and tease me... Hahaha
