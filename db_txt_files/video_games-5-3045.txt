I love this game. The storyline is great, the battle system is very nice, and it's got some of the best music I've ever heard in any game. It's a true masterpiece. Blitzball is also an excellent addition to the game. The only annoyance is the difficulty of obtaining items to unlock celestial weapons, but other than that, I have absolutely no complaints about this masterpiece.
