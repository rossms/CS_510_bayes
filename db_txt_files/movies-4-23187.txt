I first became interested in watching this movie when I saw the Garth Brooks music video to it, so I finally rented it a few days ago, and WOW, it really lived up to my expectations and then some. The plot itself was creative, even if it was far-fetched, and the acting was good. It kept me on the edge of my seat throughout the entire movie, wondering what was going to happen next. A great flick, definately worth renting.
