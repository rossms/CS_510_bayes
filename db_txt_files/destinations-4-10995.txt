Knott's Berry Farm is a great park if you're looking for family fun. However, some of the rides are a bit wimpy for roller coaster, thrill-seeking fans. I remember going here as a kid and thinking it was the greatest place in the world, but as an adult, it just doesn't seem to have the same excitement. Still a charming place and I would love to take my future kids here someday.
