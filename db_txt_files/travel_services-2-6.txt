I don't understand why everyone loves this airline so much. When I fly I like to just sit and relax. Flying Jet Blue makes you feel like you are at some kind of comedy show. The flight attendents try too hard and really quite lame. The cabin is noisy and almost always full. And if you book late you will probably get stuck in a middle seat. Try sleeping on one these flights .. good luck. However, they are very well priced for the most part, and easy to deal with it when it comes to changes. With the exception of Southwest or USair I would choose any other domestic carrier over Jet blue.
