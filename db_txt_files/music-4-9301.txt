I'd have to say this is one of the better music videos out there. I supose most people would judge it by the song more than the video. Crazy Town is a great band don't get me wrong, but this m-vid has awesome special effects. It's up there with Korn's Freak On a Leash video for effect and sheer beauty quality!
