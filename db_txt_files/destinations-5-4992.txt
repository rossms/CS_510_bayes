Great state..Nice people. Cool accents, lots of woods, mountains, lakes..homey type environment. This has always been one of my favorite states to visit. I don't get why a couple people gave the states bad ratings because of a mostly white population..Did they ever think that it's mostly white because minorities don't like it there? Maybe it's too cold for them, I don't know. Maybe thats why the majority of minorities live in the south and SW. Whatever. people seem so anti white now adays. lol
