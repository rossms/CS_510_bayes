Chemical Bros have so much potential, look at their previous albums, to have a unique invasionous (i know i just made up my own word but you get the picture) sound. Unfortunetly this album is lacking all that they are great for: hard beats, off the hook samples and awesome build ups. Hopefully there next album will be more like there previous.
