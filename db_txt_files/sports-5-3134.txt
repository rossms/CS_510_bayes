I kind of laugh when old geezers talk about Ruth or Mantle as being the best ever. . .it was Willie Mays. 660 Home Runs? How about hitting for average and power? How about his defense? How about his speed? How about his ability to throw runners out? There was nothing this guy couldn't do on a diamond. He could play on any team anywhere, anytime in history.
