I spent 6 months traveling through Europe and I thought Berlin and Belfast to be the most fascinating cities I visited. The differences that still exist between the East and West are still dramatic. It feels as if WWII was ten years ago, not 60. Take a historical walking tour of the city. In 4 hours you can walk through both sides of the city, see and learn about the frightening city it was and witness the wonderful city it is becoming.
