In a multicultural society, the theme of this movie is a demogague of an identity crises that haunts several of our youths of color today. As a children's story, and as society becomes more of a melting pot, we should not not promote the identity that the word white, inherently, excules all other colors from it's immaculate, beautiful status. White is beatuiful, and so is black, yellow, and red. Maybe I'm thinking too much on the abstract level, but this is my opinion.
