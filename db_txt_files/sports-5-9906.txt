Best team in the East. Spree and Houston give NY a one-two scoring punch that is hard to defend. What's often overlooked, however, is their defense - they are both solid defenders. If NY can get everyone healthy, and get Ewing back to top form, they should romp through the East and be able to challenge any of the Western Conference Superpowers.
