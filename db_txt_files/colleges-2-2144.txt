Who cares how comfortable the climate is! If you want to be surrounded by boring imbeciles, then by all means go to Tennessee. Also, I'd like to comment on the cheap win the football team had over Kentucky squeaking out a 5 pt victory at home over a 2-9 team. But, like much of the season UT has struggled with those weak teams. The Vols could very easily be a .500 team
