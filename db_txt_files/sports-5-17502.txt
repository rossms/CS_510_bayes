In the Tampa game Minnesota was forced to be innovative, use all the weapons, and fortunately they thought creatively enough to take a few chances and come out winners....playing too conservatively is not only boring to watch, but doesn't always have a positive outcome...just ask the Tampa coach....Great game, gutsy play calling...Worthy of being a Monday Night Football Game....Congratulations Keep up the good work!!
