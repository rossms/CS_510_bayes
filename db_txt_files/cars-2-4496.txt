Another blown head gasket here; $1,100. Tranny has been slipping for six months but we are nursing it along. (HINT: If it doesn't go, drop it into 2nd to take off then shift up.) Defects will happen, but FORD is not handling these two common problems fairly. There's even a loophole in the secret warranty for the headgasket. I fell right through it. It was repaired within the time-frame, but by an independent mechanic. No refund for me, b/c repair was done after notification was made to owners. Would I have paid an indy to fix it, if I had been notified that FORD was going to fix it free? HAH!
