LOL at Celica TRD...the Viper gets passed at high speeds? By what, the Diablo for $200,000 more? The Vipers powerband is broad and smooth, typical of large engines with high displacement and many cylinders, unlike rough feeling turbo-four cylinders with small powerbands and chopping firing. The Viper is as powerful as it is gorgeous. No American car has ever performed at such an outstanding level before. Get behind the wheel and you'll see what I mean...feel the power of that smooth idling V10 and hear it roar as you plant the gas pedal to the floor...and realize that you can smoke every car around you.
