He is definitely a good actor, but what impresses me even more about him is that he doesn't seem to take himself too seriously and has remained pretty humble. His reaction to winning his Oscar (he seemed really pumped about winning it with his good friend) and his appearance on Saturday Night Live (he wasn't afraid to make fun of himself and Matt Damon) lead me to believe this. In addition, he is always engaging on all of the talk shows. I think we can expect to continue to see big things from him.
