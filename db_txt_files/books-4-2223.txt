Sure the comic strip is somewhat dated. But I can identify with the Dagwood character whenever I try to play handyman around the house--I'm usually all thumbs myself. And I often prefer to be resting on the couch or eating big sandwiches. Even though Blondie is over 70 years old, there are some aspects of that comic strip that are timeless.
