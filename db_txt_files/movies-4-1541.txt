Someone said this movie was boring; I'd have to differ with you on that one. Someone also said that Kim Basinger was in this one for eye candy. I'd have to say you're dead wrong on that. There was plenty of purpose to her character and she did a good job in her role. I believe she was not only put on screen as a major character in the story, but she was there to show that the people comitting the crimes were good-looking, Hollywood-type people. Just because a woman is thrown on screen and she is made up to look good does not mean she's there for the purpose of playing eye candy.
