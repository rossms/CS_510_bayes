Ballplayer with extreme substance in a league overrun with style. Passes, dribbles, shoots, and moves so well for a man of his size. He does not turn every dunk into an opportunity to yell and squeeze his balls. He ACTS LIKE HE'S BEEN THERE BEFORE. . .because he does have an NBA title to his credit. (Yes, I know it was the strike-year with the Knicks. . .) Duncan's numbers are simply outstanding and always rank among the leauge leaders. Ever check out his field-goal percentage?
