I gotta say a lot of New Yorkers rag on Guiliani but I think first and foremost he's done a lot for the city especially in terms of safety. I mean what mayor haven't they ragged on? Some people have problems with him but I think he's done a lot to turn around a city that was slowly (in the eyes of many outsiders) slipping into a state of disrepair and crime. Good job my man!
