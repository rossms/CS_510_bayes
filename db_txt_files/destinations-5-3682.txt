Kansas City is the quintessential American city. Near the country's geographic center, it encompasses aspects of the Old South, the brawny Southwest, the industrial North, and the agricultural Heartland. Of special note for visitors (in addition to the sports teams) are the outstanding Nelson-Atkins museum gallery, the Country Club Plaza (for shopping and dining), the rebuilt Union Station across from Hallmark's Crown Center complex, and the beautiful system of boulevards. However, the mid-continent climate can be very cold in winter, and blazing hot in the summer.
