Jodie Foster has had only one really good role, but before I give her credit, I have to say that the role was extremly winning and is one of the most looked upon chracters in history of filmmaking in the past or present future. Her role as Clarece in Silence Of The lambs won her an academy award, and I can't recall if she won it, but she deserved it, and recieves full credit for her role, opposite Sir Anthony Hopkins.
