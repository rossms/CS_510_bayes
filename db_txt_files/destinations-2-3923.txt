Live wrote a song about it *#@! Town. The city gets worse each time I visit. Quite drab, horrid weather, and the nightlife, other than Rock Jungle, is horrible. Pluses are cheap housing and relatively low crime--for an east coast/mid-atlantic city. However, income levels are the lowest for more sectors than any other city in the country. Not a vibrant city for young people, but maybe an alright place for families looking to settle down in a place where they can afford housing.
