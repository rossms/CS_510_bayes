I always thought California was such a wonderful state. There are so many things to do here, and the majority of the people are really friendly. They may not be down to earth, but they do say HI when you talk to them. As for the cities, most of them are SMOG hell, but this can be overlooked. The opportunities are endless in this wonderful state.
