Okay, okay - I'm from the pre-MTV generation and I don't even watch VH1 very often. So, I probably have no right to even be nosing around in this category. But, this is an oldie and it was obviously a way above average video - then and now. Thriller had so much detail and depth (well, for a video) it was practically a movie short. Not to mention the costumes, makeup and FX were state of the art. Should be judged and rated in relation to its impact in its time period not compared to all the mega-techno developments of the last ten years. Jackson may be weird, but he knows how to do this stuff VERY well.
