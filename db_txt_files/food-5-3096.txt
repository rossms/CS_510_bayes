I used to eat these w/ some icing on the top of them, or make sandwich cookies. They're kind of "boring" plain. But, now I buy them to use as a crust for cheesecakes that I bake. It's a nicer flavor than the graham cracker crust I think. And here's a tip for some people out there: you won't find fresh anything at Wal-Mart. That's why they can sell them so cheap. They weren't "stored" or handled quite right. Buy these at your grocery store. Better chance of freshness.
