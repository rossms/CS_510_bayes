I love Colorado. When I was growing up in Kansas City, my family would drive to a ranch in Durango, Colorado each summer, and I have a lot of great memories from those trips. Since then I ve spent a lot of time visiting Colorado, skiing in the winter and camping in the summer. Rocky Mountain National Park is one of my favorite places, and Denver is a great city. The people are nice, the weather is great (the winters, everyone says, are not nearly as bad as you would think), and it s tough to beat the beauty of the mountains.
