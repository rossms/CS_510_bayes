Nobody ran as good or passed more accuratley. Winning Superbowls doesn't mean you are the best at your position that year. If it was, superbowl winners would be the pro bowl team. Talent and winning are not mutually exclusive. Football is not that kind of sport (i.e. Barry Sanders). On paper Young is the best, watching him he is the best, but did not win the most.
