Spy Kids is a pretty good movie that you should be able to enjoy this year. Antonio Banderes plays the father and husband to a wife and two kids. He is a secret agent also, and he is working on the case of 4 missing agents, that have been brainwashed and turned into play-doh characters on a TV show. He works for a man named Devlin, played by George Clooney who is giving him the case to find them. But, they are after him too, as he is the creator of the 3rd brain.
