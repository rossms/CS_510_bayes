I was very excited to find an american potato vodka (Idaho spuds) but I was dissapointed. This vodka doesn't have the bite like Luksasowa but has a funny dry aftertaste that I can only describe as salty. My wife liked it but hates salty tastes and didn't experience the same aftertaste i did. I sold the bottle to my friend for 1/2 price he likes and drinks it on the rocks.
