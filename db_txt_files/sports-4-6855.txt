King is a pretty good GM. He's smart and makes sensible moves. He traded a of different players to finally end up with Chris Webber to go with AI. He drafted Kyle Korver, Samuel Dalembert, Willie Green and has brought in useful free agents and spare players thru trades. Getting Mo Cheeks and gettign rid of Jim O'Brien was a good move as well.
