The fries are nothing compared to Mcdonald's. I've only tasted like three good hamburgers there (even though they only have 6). I love the apple pie though. Mcdonald's pie sucks compared to theirs. Chicken Sandwich DEFINETLY better than McD's. I love McD's, don't get me wrong, but it's (BK)sometimes better than McD's.
