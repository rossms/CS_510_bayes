My only complain: bad service, specially at drive through, if you dont check your order at the moment you will surelly miss something when getting home; and they dont have atm service (here in Puerto Rico) so if you are out of cash better go to a BK. But chili chips, jr bacon cheese burger and ceasar salad...mmmmmm My kids love their toys.
