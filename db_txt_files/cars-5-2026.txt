OK Hello everybody!!! the z06 is a 405 hp all performance car. The people saying its overrated and overpriced and crap dont know anything. One question to those people. What country do you come from??? Dont buy any of that foreign mitsu-whatever the hell-bishi. The corvette can beat out any of the cars you idiots mentioned. The corvette z06 accelerates from 0-60 in 3.7 seconds and has a top speed at OVER 170 mph. Not only is this car a great american sports car, but it is the american sports car. USA!!! P.S. The chevette is long gone.!!
