I always admired Nixon. His masterstrokes in foreign policy, a honorable peace in Vietnam, Ping-Pong diplomacy, detente in Russia, were commendable. Sadly, his domestic policy and personal issues were a shambles. Whenever I see a 55 MPH speed limit, I always think this is one of Nixon's final legacies. The more I hear about some of his alleged paranoid rantings, the more I want to wish it didn't happen. Nixon is a tough one to pigeonhole.
