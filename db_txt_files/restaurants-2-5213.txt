Bennigan's is one restaurant that you may want to have at the bottom of your list. The service is terrible, you have to wait forever to get a table, and then even longer to get food and drinks. Bennigan's is a tiny little irish based restaurant that serves their food at very high prices, and it isn't as fresh as you'd want it to be.
