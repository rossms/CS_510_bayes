* Grading NBA players on lifestyle makes as much sense as rating OJ on the field based on his murder charges or actors based on politics. Makes no sense and reflects badly on the rater. * On the outer edge of the modern degrading of sports through marketing. Tremendous skill and a winning attitude that few can rival. Another of those real superstars who actually understood that being a great player means making free throws just as much as a flashy dunk or behind the back pass.
