Great Islay Scotch. True to it's seaside origin. Plenty of heady peat to satisfy those who like an assertive yet very quaffable dram. I would not recommend this drink for those new to single malts. (Try some Lowland scotches first to acclimate your palate). Overall, a fine drink for a scotch fan at about $45.00 per bottle.
