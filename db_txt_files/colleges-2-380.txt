As a McGill student I can offer some insight. McGill enjoys a good reputation in Canada, I don't think that this is directly rated to the business school though. Canada's graduate business powers are Western, Saint Mary's perhaps Schulich (York). One of the benefits of McGill is its location in Montreal -no need to tolerate London, Ontario. Another advantage is really cheap tuition but you get what you pay for. If I could go back in time I would definetly have looked very seriously at Saint Mary's University in Halifax. It might be North America's best bang for your buck.
