I visited Germany after not being in the country for 22 years, and have to tell you, that almost without exception, I had the most enjoyable time of my life. I had the luxury of getting way back in the woods and meet some real genuine German people - OK so there were a couple of 'surly' folks - but you get that almost anywhere you go. The press gives you the opinion that Germans don't like Americans - I went all over the country when I was there in Nov - Dec 2004, and if there was any anti-Americanism, I sure did not run into any of it. I would recommend a trip to Germany to anyone.
