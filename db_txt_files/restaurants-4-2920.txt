Ben Jerry's has such good ice cream. Their frozen yogurt is awesome too. I love the unique flavors (especially Phish Food), and the company is really admirable in their efforts to do good for the community and the environment. I had the opportunity of visiting the Ben Jerry's factory in Vermont and got to learn a lot about that sort of stuff. I would give B J five stars if the ice cream wasn't so darn expensive.
