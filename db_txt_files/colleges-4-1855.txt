I do a lot of research on Universities and have been to Temple and the surrounding area is very poor but Temple University is one of the best schools in the country rankings wise and does not get as much credit as it should. It's selectivity ratings for undergraduate and especially graduate programs are high and it is a city school and like all city schools is surrounded by poverty stricken areas. Regardless, the campus is amazing, possibly better then UPENN's and is more appealing than other city schools and the academics at Temple are ranked high in the country.
