George Washington, while not a perfect leader, did care deeply about the new and developing nation. In fact, he has come far closer to 'perfection,' an unreachable standard, than many modern 'learned' leaders of the world. He did not begin any wars, served his nation bravely, worked for the common good of the citizens and did not unnecessarily tax his constituents. He is perhaps one of the best leaders of any country in the world.
