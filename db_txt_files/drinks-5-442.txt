This beer is getting harder to find these days, but I can still find it if I really want it. I really enjoy this brew, it is quality, far surpasses that Sam Adams piss water low quality brew. If you know anything about beer you will know Pete's Wicked Ale is good stuff, and if you enjoy dark beers like Guiness off the tap or in the can, Samual Smith Oatmil Stout, New Castle then you will like Pete's without a question.
