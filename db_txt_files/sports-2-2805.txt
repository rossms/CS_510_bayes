What got me on Dusty's case was when he picked the all-star lineup and left off Dontrelle Willis. Now, he could have provided an excuse or ignored it, but he said I have not seen him pitch yet. That night, the Marlins started a 3-game set with the Cubs in which Dontrelle would pitch game 2. Maybe he should have done some homework in preperation for the game. Since then, I have disapproved with many managerial decisions. He is not good with switches and he has the talent. He had 3 good years with the Giants and his team blew the series.
