I love Ohio because it is my home state. Also, neat attractions including The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame museum, seaworld, Cincinnati Zoo, and King's Island. Also a low crime rate in many Ohio cities except Cincinnati where crime has increased in the last 2 years. Also, irresponsible Republican governors and politicians.
