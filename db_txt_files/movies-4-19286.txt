Good film. Definitely worth a look, a little too predictable though. I enjoyed the film immensely, and would recommend it to anyone wanting a good suspense thriller. I liked the twist at the end, but unfortunately saw the whole thing coming. John Cusack is good, but his supporting cast is better. Whatch it. If you can get by the body parts, you'll love it.
