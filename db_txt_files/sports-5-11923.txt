Love him or hate him, Bosworth was THE dominant defensive player of the 80s. He could not be blocked and he was as effective rushing the passer as he was defending tight ends in pass coverage. Also, he added a flair and personality that is missing in this era of boring players who spew politicallly correct pablum.
