This is a beer you almost want to drink on its own. Complex and sweet. Rich mouthfeel. Dark and syrupy in texture. Almost chocolate like. Definitely unique in its own right. Best on a good tap. Makes sense this beer is coming from Northern England near Scotland. Does go well with some fish and chips. I will say I do have to be in the mood for this one though because there's so much in the glass.
