I've had a 96 civic ex for 2.5 years and am very pleased. Had to replace alternator at 200km but that is all. Excellent mileage to the tune of 50mpg (imperial). Great in snow, always goes! I'm over 6 ft tall yet am quite comfortable. I'm now looking to replace this car. Guess with what. that's right, another civic. By the way am only replacing cause I need an auto trans for a new driver in the family. This car is still in great shape, no rust and runs like a new one.
