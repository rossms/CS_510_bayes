One of the most beautiful college campuses. The faculty at my program were well known in my field. The quality of education is as good as any other major university. The research programs are the best, no wonder it receives the largest amount of federal funds for research than any other university. Also nothing can beat the great view of Mt. Rainier and the beautiful city of Seattle.
