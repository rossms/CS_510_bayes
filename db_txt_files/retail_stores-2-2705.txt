Small, though prices are OK. Not a great selection of products. Stores are pretty well clean, though there is a slight odor in the produce area of the two locations I have been to. My main complaint is the service. I was really aggrivated at the lack of courtesy at these stores. The employees treated most customers as if they had better things to do than deal with them. Not a good way to stay in business.
