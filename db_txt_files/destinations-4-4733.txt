I imagine left is best was posting tongue in cheek, but I'm one liberal who would like to visit Salt Lake City someday. I want to see the stark scenery and the beautiful church. I could survive without a drink so the lack of bars would not distress me. I have my doubts about Mormonism, but there's no doubt that the history and culture of this creed is fascinating. Sometimes I wonder if there might be something to it, though, because most of the Mormons I have met have been very warm and well-mannered.
