I don't own a gamecube, but I have played a couple of games on it. The graphics are great, but the system seems just a little to kid oriented for me. I have owned an SNES,which I think is still the best game system around, just because of the quality of the games produced on it. Doesn't have to be all about graphics. N64 is a good system, but it didn't last long. I was hoping Nintendo would produce a more serious looking system besides gamecube.I have a playstation2 which is a good system, but I always liked nintendo, hope the gamecube does good.
