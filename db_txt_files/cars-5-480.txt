These are fantastic motocross bikes! The YZ 400 is a very progressive design that is rocket fast. The 250s have always been at or near the top of their class. The YZ 125 has always been rated at the top of the 125 class for the last 3 years by virtually all the dirt bike magazines. Yamaha has very good product quality control and the bikes are very reliable.
