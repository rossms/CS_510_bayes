A very impressive and flashy rusher. Has that ring Jackson would kill for. I would choose Jackson over Walker head to head but I can't argue with those who prefer Walker. Dooley finally found the team and player he needed to win a title over Bryant in the SEC. It came in Bryants last few years but Dooley deserved a national championship and Walker delivered.
