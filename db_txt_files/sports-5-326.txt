Granted he does make a ridiculous amount of money, but he puts up ridiculous numbers too. His stats are just flat out sick! And if all goes well for him, baseball's all-time HR king might end up being a shortstop?!? Presently, the only down-side to him is playing for the Rangers, but if I was offered a quarter of a billion dollars to play a game I love, you would be stupid not to take it.
