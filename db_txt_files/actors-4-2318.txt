People, let me remind you...this poll is about his ACTING, not his religious convictions! One of his first movies, Tim was a performance for the ages, as was Braveheart. What amazes me is that I guarantee a high percentage of you giving him a 1 would've given him a 4 or 5 before Passion came out. Rate his ACTING ABILITY, not his social views. And don't hold him accountable for his father. They are two different people. Do you agree 100% with all of your parents views? I know I don't. He is a very good ACTOR. Not in the league of Hoffman, Pacino, DeNiro, etc. , but worthy of a 4.
