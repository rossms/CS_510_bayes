This may have been an innovative video, but there wasn't much substance to it. It seemed almost as if it were trying too hard to be 'artsy'. It was simple and new, but to me it seemed like there was a pretty good reason why it wasn't done before. I have to give her a little credit for trying, though. This video seemed to influence later videos (Alanis Morrisette's Head over Feet ), so obviously SOMEONE out there liked it. To me, though, it's nothing too special.
