I think that Allen has it all: The game, the attitude and of course the looks. He'ss definitely get far in the NBA and become a future hall of famer. The scary thing is is that he is still relaively new and still has so much potential.If Al gets hurt to the point where he can never play b-ball again, my basketball watching days are over.
