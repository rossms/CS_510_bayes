If Iverson stays healthy, he may become one of the league's all time great players. What's scary is that Larry Brown seems to have instilled in him, and the whole team, the desire to win through defense. Iverson's talent, combined with what is becoming a consistently high level of intensity on defense, is a dangerous combination. Now that it is June, and it is clear that the Sixers are still a couple of steps away from being a contender, I don't know what they should do. Can Iverson be a leader? I'm not sure yet. If he can't, I think they should deal him.
