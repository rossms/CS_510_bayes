Sharp may not be the top brand name in TVs - it may not even be close - but I had a 27 Sharp for years and years, and it was an excellent TV. The picture was great, and the thing kept working even after I knocked it over a few times. When it finally did quit working on me (after about 5 years of loyal service), I bought a Sony, and I honestly think the Sharp had a better picture.
