This aquarium has a unique layout that lets you move along nicely, yet plenty of room to stop for as long as you like at any given display. The Seahorse display is FANTASTIC! The rainforrest was above and beyond in quality of the setting and the animals within. The staff in the rainforrest were the best I had ever encountered in such a setting they showed genuine interest and knowledge of the area animals but more importantly they seemed to enjoy there job and the people they interacted with! The Aquarium is located at the inner harbor area and makes for one great day ' for all ages.
