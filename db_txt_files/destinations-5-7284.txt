I only spent a couple of days in Vienna, but they were great days. In the late summer they have a free film festival, and there's an international equivalent of 'Taste of Chicago' before the films. The food was amazing, and they projected this wild opera movie onto the side of an amazing old building. The entire experience was memorable, and my only complaint was that I hadn't brought a girl I was interested in - because two nights with her in that city and I would have been looking good.
