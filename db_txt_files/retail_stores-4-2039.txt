I purchased a home computer from them 3 years ago. Part of the deal was that I received a free printer (which was, of course, one of the cheapest ones in the store). Predictably, the printer broke after 6 months. I brought it back and they gave me a new printer (different model, still in the same price range). That broke. I'm now on my 4th free printer, they've never questioned me at all. Prices are decent and selection is pretty good.
