It's an alright place to shop, with a basic selection, but from my experience it's not that great to work for them. But, I guess that's dependent on each individual location. If you really want to peruse a large selection of books or am looking for a slightly more obscure title, it might be best if you go to a Border's or Barnes Noble than this.
