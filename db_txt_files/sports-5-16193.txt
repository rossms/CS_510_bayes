i think that we all got to see somthing, that only happens in the movies or in a story. for a guy to get a one in a million chance not only to play in the nfl but to win a superbowl. i think that the nfl better be ready because he has more to show . the rams will win more superbowls as long as warner is the capt. can't wait till this season starts
