I've owned a Panasonic KX-FP250 for about four years now. It was pretty cheap, and it does the job. I don't use it very often, but it's nice to have it around when I need to fax or copy something. My only complaint is that sometimes when I'm sending a multi-page fax, the feeder will take two or three sheets at a time, which can be really, really annoying.
