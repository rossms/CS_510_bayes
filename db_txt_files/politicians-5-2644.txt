Wow- what a shame this guy didn't become president instead of President Nitwit-the-Dubya! An honorable man of integrity was too hard for the GOP to swallow, I guess. They just wouldn't tolerate an independant man with a brain. Nope- instead they put their money and power behind a glassy-eyed idiot puppet. Too bad.
