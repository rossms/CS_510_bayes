Unlike the rest of Dallas, Deep Ellum actually has a little bit of flavor. You will not find the huge chain restaurants that line the superhighways that make up most of the DFW area. This neighborhood is actually a little scruffy - there are converted warehouses serving as live music venues, and it is generally a pretty raucous scene. It is the only part of Dallas that I saw that wasn't antisceptic - definitely worth a look if you find yourself on an overnight layover or something.
