Difficult call to make, I have two a 93 with 203k and a 94 with 194k miles. Both have needed a new transmission (I would have placed a 3 speed instead but with the 3.3 Liter the ultradrive is all you have for a choice!) but not a single other problem ever besides routine maintenance. Both cars work flawless down to the A/C. If Chrysler would just fix the tranny, it would be perfect.
