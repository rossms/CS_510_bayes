This film begs to be put out of its misery. First, obvious budget cuts cause the entire movie to be cropped very close to the action. This gives a very unrealistic cheap feel to the movie. Second, no matter how advanced machines become, a 2003 police car still requires a driver. The actor playing John Conner is terrible, one of the worst I've ever seen, and the story pretty much leaves off where the other two did except this one has no depth. The story is one long chase scene. Try again Arnold.
