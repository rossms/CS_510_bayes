Hit 755 homeruns without ever having a 50HR season. That shows a level of consistency that is just phenomenal. Took great care of himself. He was indeed a Zen Master at the plate. Once hit 22 home runs one minor league season, holding the bat the WRONG WAY!! I'm shocked that he's not at least in the top three on this board.
