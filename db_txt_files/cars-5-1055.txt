I own a 1996 Nissan Maxima. Why comment on an older car? Well, I have had it now for many years and it has been a great car, never had a problem. The car has had only ONE recall with a engine light problem. Not too many other cars can say that. At higher altitudes the car has been known to have some problems starting on a second turnover but by using the highest octane gas I feel this can reduce the problem. I have run into this problem maybe once a year - not a big deal. It has one of the best V6 engines ever made. Great family car.
