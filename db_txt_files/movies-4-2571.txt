Since his Hong Kong movies which my mum forced us to watch to improve our Chinese, I must say Jackie's still doing great without a stuntman! This Hollywood movie is definitely better than his other one, Rush Hour. Lucy still looks great, all princessy... Oh yeah, and Owen Wilson's got really miraculous luck in shooting that last bullet.
