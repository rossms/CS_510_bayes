This is a really good game, it almost kinda does for you what you wanted to do in the other game, explore new planets, better talking to your people, you get to change if your teammates are good or bad, the mandalorians are on your team, (well ok, maybe just for me, i like mandalorians) i would give this a 5 if the end wernt so dissapointing, the spacehip just flies off in space!?!?!? if they make knights of the old republic III and make it tell you a little more about what happened, my rating is raising to a 5
