Maybe the Super Dome really is haunted. It was built on an old cemetary, you know. The Saints either a) start off the season, then make a huge run at the end of the season or b) start off the season looking like a Super Bowl contender, then fade off into the west. They have to do something right to have beaten Tampa Bay, but they will never do it consistently unless Haslet starts making examples of a few players. They have one of the best backs in the NFC and a young, rising star at quarterback. But will that be enough?
