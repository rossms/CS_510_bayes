In my opinion, this is the best there is. I am a fan of all IBC sodas but their black cherry is oustanding. Like all IBC sodas it is packaged in old fashioned embossed glass bottles which maintains purity of flavor. If you take three or four large swallows and then exhale through your nose, it's the most sensational flavor rush you'll ever experience with a soft drink. In my view every other brand is a distant second. It would still be a bargain at twice the price.
