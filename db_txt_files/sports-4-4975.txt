Well, Georgetown got their defining win of the John Thompson Jr era today, knocking off undefeated and #1 ranked Duke, and I sure am happy for John Thompson Jr. He's a good coach. Since he's taken over the hoyas, they've been disciplined and patient, and have come pretty close to breaking out. Hopefully today marks a revival of Hoya Paranoia.
