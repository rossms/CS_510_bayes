I've always had a fascination with Orleans, I've never been there but the lure of this historical and culturally significant part of America has beckoned me for quite awhile -The French Quarter, Mardi Gras, The Garden District, Voodoo priests, and Cajun cooking all hold an interest for me .... I hope this city and her people will recover one day. Hell, I hope the REST of America can recover from this as well...
