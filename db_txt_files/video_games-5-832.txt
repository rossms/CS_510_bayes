This is one of my favorite games of all time. Anyone can play it. At least anyone over the age of 10. It is has a little strategy to it but you don't have to think too much. It is fast. It is easy. I don't get bored of playing. I usually start out saying best out of 3, then I don't want to stop so it gets moved to best out of 5 etc. etc. Nothing is better than getting a Yahtzee (where you get all 5 di the same number). It is just a really fun game and you can bring it anywhere.
