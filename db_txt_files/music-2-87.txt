Released in 1992, Automatic For The People is not the best full-length effort from R.E.M., though I can't really say which one is. (R.E.M. really lost something when they switched labels from IRS Records to Warner Bros.) Though the opening track Drive is one of R.E.M.'s best singles, the rest are almost painfully depressing and lingering. Even the singles Everybody Hurts and Man On The Moon do not live up to the band's standards. The bottom line is that R.E.M. shows clear signs of losing their edge and hunger with Automatic For The People.
