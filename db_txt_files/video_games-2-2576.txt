Dont be fooled, this is not spiderman two on the PSP or PS2, this has more in common with the GBA version, once again it's a case of a gba game rush over to DS formate with a few touch screen slide puzzles jammed in as an after thought to make it look like they actualy cared about the DS game. The less said about the prison van escape level the better. The DS needs solide games made just for itself, not hurried convertions from a lesser console.
