First of all, if anybody mentions anything about how Gay the game is, they should be smacked. Glad I got that off my chest. Now about the game. What is there not to say? This is one of the best Zeldas ever. The storyline really had me hooked. The whole ocean thing was an exellent idea on Miyamoto's part. My favorite thing about it was the swordplay-It's improved a lot scince the days of OoT. The animation was so fluid if had me dumbfounded. Overall the game is absolutley fasmatasmic.
