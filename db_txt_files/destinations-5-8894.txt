Peach is the best, i had stopped dipping for a while cause the money and i didnt find too much i really liked, but my buddy introduced me to the Wolf peach. Real good flavor and unlike Skoal Apple its a lot cheaper and doesnt have a super sweet candy taste. I'd reccomend it highly to anyone looking for a good priced good flavor dip.
