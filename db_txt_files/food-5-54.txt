Dreyers may well be my favorite all-around ice cream brand on the market-- some individual flavors are done better by other companies, but Dreyers is hard to beat in terms of reliability. They have it all-- good takes on classic flavors (vanilla, mint chip), tasty creative options (French Vanilla Fudge Pie comes to mind), and unusually good low-fat offerings (their low-fat French Silk is delicious by any standards). Dreyers may not be as rich as the premium brands (Ben & Jerry's, Double Rainbow, Haagen Dazs), but the flavor and texture are excellent, and that's what matters.
