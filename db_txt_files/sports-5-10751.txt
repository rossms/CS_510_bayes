While Coach Lubick's days at CSU are numbered (he's well into his 60's) he deserves so much credit for turning one of the biggest laughingstocks in all of college football into a BCS-caliber powerhouse. One day his hard work will pay off - a well-deserved invitation to the Big XII or the PAC-10 will be the fruit of his labor, even if it's his successor who is at the helm when the time comes. A truly respected and outstanding coach who means more to his community than almost any other coach in the country.
