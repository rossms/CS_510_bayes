I think that the people on here knocking the school are only upset because they probably couldn't get accepted. The personality of the school is second to none, and the students are, by far, the smartest kids in the country. I was talking about this with some of my fellow MIT friends - We could easily do well in any Ivy humanities class, but try sticking a Harvard Poli Sci major in an MIT physics course... no grade inflation here!
