During this season they have a few more playmakers (Andre Johnson and Dominack Davis) and are gaining some confidence. Carr just got hurt, but it wasn't from getting sacked to much, and they are getting him some more time in the pocket. He should pass for over 2,500 yards, and they will possibly manage to slide in a respectable (for a second-year team) 7-9 record. They will finish third, above the sorry Jags, BUT they are cocky and pesky enough to beat any team on any given night. Next year they could be a playoff contender.
