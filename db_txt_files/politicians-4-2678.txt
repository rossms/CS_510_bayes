Mr. McCain is an awesome Senator. I think he is a much needed presences in our Congress. As for President, he's better than GW Bush, but I don't have a lot of confidence in him in that position. I've been wondering about his stability since long before Bush started attacking him. Besides, I'm not sure the Senate can afford the loss of such a positive influence!
