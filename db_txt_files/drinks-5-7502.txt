I think some of you who are answering that this vodka is too strong have got to stop raiding their parents' liquor cabinets and concentrate on studying for that big leap from middle school into high school. This stuff is smoothe and pure and oh so nice. I rank it right up there with grey goose for mixing purposes. A real treat and a great mixer or shooter. Maxim mag recently rated it one of the top 5 purest vodkas on the market.
