There is much to see in all of New York-its hard for the upstate to compete with a mega star like New York City, but there is much in the rural upstate. Try the Catskills, or the Finger Lakes, or the Niagara region. Lake Placid is just that. While there is history everywhere, like at Lake George and for baseball fans, Cooperstown. New York city needs little in the way of a tourist intro- it speaks for itself.
