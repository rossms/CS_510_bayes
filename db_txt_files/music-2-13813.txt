I admit that some of Kid Rock's stuff is catchy, but the majority of it is a bunch of crap. He seems to appeal primarily to immature white teenagers who build up a deep well of frustration because they can't quite get comfortable with themselves or their role in society. That in itself might be healthy, but once you're better-adjusted, what's stopping you from moving on? The idiotic lyrics? The repetitive beats? The screeching, electronically-enhanced voice?
