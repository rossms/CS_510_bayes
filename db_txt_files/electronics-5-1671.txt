I have had my Toshiba for nearly 2 years now, I would not trade it for the world. the pitcure is sharp and sound is wonderful. It has two 6x9 speakers in it so it sounds good even when not hooked up to the surround sound. My wife loves it too she can watch all her woman shows, with out resetting the picture from my sporting events. The perfect all around tv. Would recomend it to anyone.
