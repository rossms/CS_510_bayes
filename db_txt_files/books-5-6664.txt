a great story for people unfamiliar with fantasy to start with. Tolkien writes a fantasy story that isn't too heavy handed or hard to follow. Bilbo is a funny and sympathetic character. This book is great for children. It offers friendship, adventure, courage, quick-thinking and a dozen other things that are important for children to learn, without being preachy about it. Over all, this is just a fun book!
