Great actor in movies. The two stars are for what he does off the set. He is just another person who thinks he's opened minded, until you disgree with him. It's sad that many americans base there own opinion on what actors and other entertainers say. Everybody has an agenda, brainwashing YOU is one of Hollywoods bullet points.
