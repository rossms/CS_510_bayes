Situation!!!, If you ve tried this beer in America, I can tell you your first problem . My thoughts go out to a beach in Mexico, being brought Pacifico e in a sweating bucket overflowing with beer and ice. Nothing satisfies me on a beach like an ice cold Pacifico..., don't forget the quarter size lime halves.
