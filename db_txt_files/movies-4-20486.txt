The first time I saw this movie on video, It was pretty good. The segments were excellent. My favorite segment was Rhapsody In Blue. and i thought it was good how they brung back The Sorcerer's Apprentice from the orignal Fantasia to the new one. the music is good and the animation is cool. this is a must-see for Disney fans. I love it all.
