SMokey's are great. Realize though that the area is big. The most amazing road, BlueRidge Parkway, probably runs 300 miles or more. This winding two lane road runs through the whole park and connects Smokey's with shanandoah park. Camping ooprtunities are ample and excellent. Mount Mitchell area is very beautiful. Sadly though, here is evidence of acid rain and pollution at high altitudes. Makes it clear that if we are not careful and protect our environment, it is easy to damage it beyond repair.
