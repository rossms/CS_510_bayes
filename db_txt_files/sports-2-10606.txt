Artical in AJC said Richt should fire Richt. Amen. Auburn 3 and ten and he calls an off tackle run and kicks a FG? Then AB has the ball 4 AND 10!!!!! and they run the PREVENT!!!!!! then with over a minutue on the clock they decided to have a goal line stand? I am just a fan but why not let them score and keep the minute 55 left on the clock ?? Did he think they would miss a one yard FG? Wasn't our last scorring drive 75 yards in under 2 mins? Granted the players dropped the ball a few times but the playcaller gets the loss by a long shot.
