Maybe plain M M's aren't all that exciting, but they are still good. And I love that they change colors for different holidays/seasons. I used to get so excited as a kid when I got to eat red green M M's for Christmas, and then all the pastel colored ones at Easter...and now they have M M's for Halloween, Thanksgiving, Valentine's Day, Fourth of July, etc. That's a whole lotta fun in a bag!
