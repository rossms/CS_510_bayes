Jason Williams does things that nobody has seen since Pistol Pete. I do think it does help that he is white, but that is not all. I have not seen allen iverson pull off some of the moves that J-Dub does. He decision making is questionable though. Overall I do not see how anyone could say he does not have skills. He has broke about everybody off in the NBA.
