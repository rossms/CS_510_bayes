I am addicted to one of yor flavors. Your White Chocolate Latte. I am so serious about this that I had my Publix store order one case a month just for me. I can prove it! Laely I have noticed that there is one chunk of the white choc fudge in the middle. It really needs to be put into the ice cream in smaller chunks. As a matter of fact that is why I went to this site to find someone that can help me.If you know that site or web address so I can speak with someone, please email amazingdoc@aol.com. Thank you
