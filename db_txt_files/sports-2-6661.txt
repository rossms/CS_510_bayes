What can you say about a guy who get's the absolute best talent available at the time. He DID NOT make Jordan a team player, that is like saying he turned him into the defensive superstar which he became as his career progressed. he is more of a babysitter than a coach, his recent group of thugs have no love or respect for the game (see olympic participation) and only see the green or the ring. These guys should never lose a gfame with this talent, if he was any type of coach this would have been drove home a long time ago. Team game guys !!
