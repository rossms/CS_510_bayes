Super heavy rock from the band Metallica always WISHED they were. Dave Mustaine, despite (or possibly because) of his demons writes some of the best, most pointed lyrics in metal. He is at his best here. Raw, uncompromising and with incredible musicianship, this is an album every metal fan should hear.
