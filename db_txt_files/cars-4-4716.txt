I've had my S-10 for five and a half years and the thing I like about it most (other than the gas mileage) is that it's paid for. The only problems I've had over those 5 and a half years is the serpentine belt and a u-joint. Other than that, I haven't had any problems whatsoever. The only thing I would change is the interior room. There is none. And if you have a passenger, forget it. Going Christmas shopping is an ordeal because you have to pile things on top of each other to get it all in there.
