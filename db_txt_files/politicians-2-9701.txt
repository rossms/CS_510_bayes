 Hey hey LBJ how many kids did you kill today!! One of the worst presidents of the late 20th century. The Great Society killed this country and it wasn't until Reagan came along that we finally started back on the road toward econoimic freedom. His vision of Guns and Butter just did not work. He should have concentrated more on Vietnam. His pursuit of social programs diverted his attention and cost thousands of young patriotic Americans their lives. Only reason he gets two stars was some of his civil rights work. And even some of that was flawed.
