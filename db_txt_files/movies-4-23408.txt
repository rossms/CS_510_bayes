This was a great, great movie.... until the damn aliens got involved! There was absolutely no need for them!! You had a great submarine flick, with good character development, lots of drama, good special effects... everything you could want in a movie. Then the aliens were thrown in, apparently as an afterthought, which in my opinion only served to confuse the plot. Sure the special effects of having a liquid -like alien were really cool, but it was totally unnecessary.
