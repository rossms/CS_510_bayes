A truly great total package car. I've owned 2 generations of RX-7's prior to my Z and I also own a 94 Supra currently. While the handling of my 93 7 was awesome and the power of the Supra was great, the Z brought the two together in a great combination. While other cars are superior at one or two particular traints, the Z excels at many, which is more important to me.
