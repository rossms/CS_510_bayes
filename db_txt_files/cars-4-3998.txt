I own the 2004 4-cylinder 5-speed. Bought it in January and between soccer trips and daily commuting/shuttling kids my wife's put 7500 miles on it. The best thing I can say is it's FUN to drive and the preteen kids think it's cool. I drive it like a sports car. My wife preferred her Grand Cherokee to this, but gas mileage on the 4 banger is good and if it holds up as well as my 145,000 miles Saturn SL1 I'll be happy.
