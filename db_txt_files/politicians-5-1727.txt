I'm surprised at the low score he's gotten on this list. One of our most popular governors in recent history. As a Republican in heavily Democratic Massachusetts he had to walk a fine line so as not to alienate anyone. Another one who resigned early to accept an ambassadorship. Didn't get it, however, as his appointment was blackballed by Jesse Helms who didn't consider him conservative enough. Too bad. He was a decent governor and a genuinely nice man.
