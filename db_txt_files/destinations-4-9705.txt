these are good, a lot smoother than reds and a little easier on the inhale but still are harsh, not for light smokers. could be smoother but hey, if ur lookin for a smoother cigarette go with the lights, although its like sucking down air, thats what smooth is. I didnt notice a difference in taste between these and reds, i only noticed that they are easier on the inhale
