Kobe is the best and he will be the greatest of all time. He doesn't need shaq. When he didn't play with shaq he averaged 40 something points a game. He could take on any defense by himself and he could dominate anyone 1 on 1 expecially Iverson because Iverson sucks and Kobe could school him any day. Just look at the stats and learn. KOBE WILL BE THE GREATEST!!!
