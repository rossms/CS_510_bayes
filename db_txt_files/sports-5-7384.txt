The center of choice to start for the mother of all teams. He is everything that Bill Walton should've been. Amazingly, he learned the game at a late stage in life, yet accomplished more than even he imagined. What sets him apart from the other big men was his relentless effort. He didn't plod down court, he didn't wait for the rebound, and he certainly didn't half-step to the basket...rather, he hustled, he took, and he conquered!!!
