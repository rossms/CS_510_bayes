I feel smart when I play this game. Chess combines strategy, with patience, with experience, with the awareness that you are playing a game that has been played in the same way for hundreds of years. When I am rich and famous, one of the few luxury items which I plan to spend big bucks on is a handmade, world-class chess set. I have been looking for the right set for the past ten years or so, but still haven't found THE one. I'll know it when I see it...
