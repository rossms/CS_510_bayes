For the uninitiated (Northerners, mostly), Mississippi can be an unflattering place. But look a little deeper: a rich history, great music (home of the blues), great food, nice people, and neat little towns (Oxford is a good example). All this, plus some of the finest-looking women on the planet. Mississippi deserves a better reputation.
