When she first became prominent, I thought she was an overhyped nothing who excelled at exotic accents. That was until I saw her in Sophie's Choice. It was a breathtaking performance. I've seen nothing to match it since then but, to be fair, Hollywood seems less and less concerned about producing films that have any artistic merit (or any merit period). It's reassuring to know she's still around, and still working. I think Meryl is what someone like Julia Roberts wants to be. Good luck.
