this guy ran for 1,000 yard seasons every year with a terrible offensive line. they didn't give him the ball inside the red zone because he wasn't a power back. emmitt smith had quite possibly the best offensive line in the history of the league, so they moved defenses, which allowed him to waltz into the end zone. he chose not to continue his career and retired in his prime. he is hands down the greatest nfl player ever! he hasn't played in 5 years, yet they still show his clips in pregame videos because there hasn't been anyone near as gifted as he was in the open field before or since.
