Here's where I found the stereotype of the self-sufficient New Englander to be true. This is the place a stranger is least likely to ask you for a handout ... in my time spent here I met people who recycled everything, who lived well on seemingly nothing, and who depended on no one for outside help. A flinty but friendly folk. Quite beautiful place for much of the year, too, but bring a coat.
