Laura Linney is unique in a way because there really isn't another actress I can think of that exudes so much confidence on screen. Every role she has taken to date feels as if it was tailor made for her and in return she has given nothing but a strong performance each time. I think it's partly down to her natural ability to dominate the screen while feeling quite comfortable with her upstate New York type bossy sex appeal.
