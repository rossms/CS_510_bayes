Good 'ol Jewel is given a bad rap for her sweetsie persona- but- the girl can write. This album shows her talent, and the lyrics are beautiful. One shouldn't miss out on some of her Christmas and holiday music as well. Don't let Jewel's weird body language and occasional squeakiness get to you- just close your eyes and listen to the meaningful lyrics. Worth buying!
