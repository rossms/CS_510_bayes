The Lakers, even after all that's gone on in this past offseason, are still the team to beat in the West. They are after all, defending Western Conf. Champions. I agree with narek33 that they are the Yankees of basketball, everyone hates on them cuz they keep winning. Jealousy!! The Lakers will always be in the mix with Kobe and now that the fake trial is off his back ( all the girl wants is $$$, for anyone who hasn't noticed) Kobe will be more relaxed and focused on what he does best, winning games for the L.A. Lakers. I will stick with the team through everything, and i hope all TRUE Lakers fan will too.
