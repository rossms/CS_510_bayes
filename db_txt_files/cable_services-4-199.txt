After I found out that Voom was cutting us off I started looking for alternatives. I found this company that provides satellite service and they carry quite a few American and Canadian HD channels, they also have the movie network and a few others as well. I have had it up and running for a few weeks now and I am pretty pleased with it so far. I don't want to blatently spam the site so if anyone wants any info just send me an email and I'll give you the companys information and you can check them out for yourselves. Email me at maryjorgensen at gmail dot com.
