There's something charming about a little mining town by a lake. Unfortunately, there's something not-so-charming about the people living there. I know you'll think I'm crazy if I say that Texans are generally smarter than Michiganders, but it seems to be true. The people I spoke to in Marquette couldn't hold a conversation if their life depended on it, and of course they attempted to in that god-awful Fargo accent.
