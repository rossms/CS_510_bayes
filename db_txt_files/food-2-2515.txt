Now, don't get me wrong--caramel and chocolate is an EXCELLENT combination--the fabulous Rolos pull it off quite nicely. This candy bar, though, well... that's another story. The caramel here is VERY liquidy--too much so for my taste and my clothing. Also, the caramel is simply not very flavorful. So what is good about it? Well, the chocolate outside is great! So... just get a Cadbury chocolate bar if you want to enjoy the chocolate part of a Cadbury Caramello. Just... just not this.
