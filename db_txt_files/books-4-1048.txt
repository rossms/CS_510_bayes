Personally, I think this book was well written. It actually made me cry at one point but I didn't particularly like the direction Rowling went with the book. (SPOILER WARNING) I guess, I just didn't want Snape to be evil, as much as I didn't like him. I think this stems from how much I trusted Dumbledore, and how much I would rather him have been right about Snape than Lord Voldemort been right.
