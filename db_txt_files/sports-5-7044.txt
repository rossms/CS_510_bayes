michael jordan is the best of all time cuz he played the game to a whole different level a level that no one could compete with him. he could shoot, awesome handles and his dunks and defense were legendary no one could top him. wit chamberlin is the top on this list well thats a mistake cuz chamberlin couldnt handle bein in the nba when jordan was in n larry bird couldnt even compete with jordan. hes the best there ever was and ever will be
