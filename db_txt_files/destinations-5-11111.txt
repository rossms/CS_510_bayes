Daytona is da bomb!! I love going there every year. If you have something bad to say about Daytona, then you are just really lame, because there is nothing lame about Daytona. There are plenty of hotels, shops, restuarants, and other action to check out! And the beach is awesome. Sometimes thoguh the ocean looks like a lake...but it just depends on what time of the year you go. But it kicks ass! And that one person said they didn't like it coz' it was to crowed...hello...it's a beach! What do you expect..plus it's one of the most popular beaches.
