The only reason I'm giving Nilla Wafers two stars instead of one is because they can be very good when crushed and used in recipes (usually for some sort of a crust). As a cookie, though, the Nilla Wafer is a dud. Bland and unimaginative, the Nilla Wafer is not an attractive treat. Very young children are the only people who can be fooled into eating them, which should give you a clue.
