He's still mentally Jerry Rice. He knows how to get open, how to set guys up, especially on crosses and slants. His hands are still great. He just isn't the fastest guy out there anymore. He's not going to hurt you after the catch. He's limited to the shorter routes now, and the guys throwing to him now aren't as good. Garcia and Gannon are a far cry from Montana and Young.
