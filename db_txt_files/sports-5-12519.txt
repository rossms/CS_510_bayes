Great team with great talent and one of the worst coaching staffs in all of college football. Just ask your self what a real coach would do with this kind of talent year in and year out. GET RID OF LLOYD CARR!!! It is time for Michigan to GO OUTSIDE OF THE INBRED STABLE OF MEDIOCRE coaches and get a real coach. Just ask yourself what Steve Spurrier would do with this kind of talent.
