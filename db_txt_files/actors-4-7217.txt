I can't say enough about Roberto Benigni's performance in Life is Beautiful. As close to perfect as any acting I've ever seen. It's tough to imagine any of the top U.S. actors pulling off that role as well as Benigni. That being said, Life is Beautiful is such a good overall movie it's tough to know if Benigni would do as well in another environment. Actors like DeNiro, Pacino, and Hanks have proven themselves with multiple Oscar-worthy performances, which earns them five stars in my book. Once Benigni shows he's more than a one-hit wonder, he'll get more than four stars from me. And I hope he does it soon.
