Avoid actually going into the stores (unless you'd like to slobber over the occasional gorgeous cashier), and stick with the catalog (print, NOT the online version). The selection is far better, ordering via phone is a snap (as their personnel are quite well-trained and helpful), pick-up and returns are a breeze, and the build quality of most everything they carry is high. They're trying harder to gain more mainstream appeal, but it's rough to shed the old upper-middle-class image that took them decades to construct. Your wallet takes a hit, but you get what you pay for.
