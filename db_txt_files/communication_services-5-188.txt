I consider Verizon to be the best of the major companies in terms of service quality. Their US coverage areas are impressive, and they drop significantly fewer calls than the norm. Call clarity and tech support are also above average. The mobile phone service industry is similar to the airline industry in how notorious they can be for ticking off their customers, so going with a company with relatively fewer potholes may save much grief in the long run. Based on research I've seen and personal experience with family and friends, their main competitors could take some lessons from them, Sprint especially.
