I dont know what everyone else is talking about...this stuff is Gods gift to man. Me and my alcoholic buddies drink this stuff straight to the skull. My friend actually drank a liter of this stuff every day for a month. But heres a little treat...mix some tropicana fruit punch with some Mr. Boston and throw in a couple rocks and poof! you have yourself quite a treat....a Bronson Arroyo(a redsox pitcher from my hometown of Brooksville Florida)...
