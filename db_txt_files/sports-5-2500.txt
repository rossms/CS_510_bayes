THE CUBS ROCKK!!!!!!! OKAY LOOK AT THIS 2 years ago they were 65-95 horrible record i know and then just like that Dusty Baker comes and makes some trades gets them 5 outs away from the World series in teh first year of coaching the team. Now this offseason he has picked up Lattroy Hawkins, GREAT SETUP MAN, Derek Lee, UNBELIEVABLE POWER, and Greg Maddux and Todd walker, who did amazingly well with the Redsox, these guys are going to win their divison next year and go all the way to teh World series and win it. AND HOW CAN YOU GET BETTER THAN SAMMY SOSA WHAT A GUY!!!!!!
