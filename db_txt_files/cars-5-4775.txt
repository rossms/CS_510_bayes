I own a 2003 Ford Ranger Edge 4x4 with a 4.0L engine. I bought it in Nov 2002 and have yet to have a problem with it. It currently has 40,000 miles on it. Handles great in snow and muddy conditions. Tows great and i love the acceleration it has. It is a beast. I test drove every other truck out there and i liked this one best. I highky reccommend this truck to everyone!
