I try to be positive,but this state stinks like the dead skunk that was under my window the other morning! The people are extremely materialistic, and all they can conversate about is money, cars, weddings and homes. Alot of Jersey is very pretty but the people there makes it ugly. Trenton is horrible and so is Newark. I wouldnt live there if someone offered me 100million dollars(no lie). I'll stick with Pennsylvania and south of there. Thanks!. Only good thing about Jersey is I met my wonderful husband there!!
