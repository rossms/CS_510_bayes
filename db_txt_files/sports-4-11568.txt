Good coach who has made Northwestern competitive. There was a time where Football was an afterthought at Northwestern. Now Football is meaningful again as he's successfully followed up on Gary Barnett. One nitpick is that he really pirated the Tulane/Tommy Bowden/Rich Rodriguez Spread Offense. I watched Tulane's 12-0 , 1998 Offense and Northwestern looks like the stole the game films from that team and copied that style. Steal from the best I guess?
