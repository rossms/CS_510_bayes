This movie had some kick-ass fight sequences - I mean, really incredible stuff - in my opinion, even better than the Matrix. A little too much romance for my taste, but the martial arts scenes make up for it: NOTE TO MUNSON: ANYONE WHO HAS NAMED HIMSELF AFTER A DEAD CATCHER SHOULD BE CAREFUL ABOUT CALLING OTHER PEOPLE STRANGE.
