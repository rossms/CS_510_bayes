I like shopping at the Gap. One of the few clothing stores where the employees are helpful, I feel 100X more welcome here than when I step foot in Abercrombie. The Gap employees won't corner you and throw their sales pitch game at you but at the same time they won't try and avoid you. The clothing is comfortable and priced reasonably. Items are arranged in a logical manner.
