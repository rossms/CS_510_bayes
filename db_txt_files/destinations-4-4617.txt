What Browngirl said is absolutely ridiculous. To whip out some stats: ON WEIGHT: -Milwaukee was rated the 24th fattest city in the US. -Mississippi and mostly other southern states filled the top 10. (Texas was 2nd) -Chicago was rated 4th. -Wisconsin was rated the 35th fattest state in the US. -Illinois was ranked 5th. Milwaukee is very segregated, but honestly, what big city isnt to a certain degree? And also: No one uses the N word here. This person is just an immature hater.
