I got a Vibe and it's great. I believe that cars of same maker can present several discrepancies in quality assurance. My dashboard and brakes are perfect, and I am having a great time with my car. The style of the Matrix is more urban than the Vibe, which has a SUV type of appeal. The Matrix is a nice car, but, speaking of grills, the BBQ they put it in front of the car is horrible!
