Rock and Roll is dead, but I am so glad Guns N' Roses ended it with this all time great video. This song was an instant classic. This band is the best of the last. Hell, this band is the best of the best! Only Led Zepplin could compare but they are a little outdated. Too bad Guns didn't make more music together.
