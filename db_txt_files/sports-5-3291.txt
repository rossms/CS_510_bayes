Threw the best heater in the game during his tenure. No one could touch it, and that was how he liked it. I admire a guy who can throw down consistantly high numbers like he did with consistantly low numbers of days lost to injury. Easy selection to the Hall, if he's not already in (haven't been keeping up on inductions...bad me).
