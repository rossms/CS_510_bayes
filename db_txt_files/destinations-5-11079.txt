Hilton Head is a fantastic tourist destination. It is divided into six plantations that are gated communities. Crime is almost non existant, unlike Florida. The beaches are really nice. For golf and tennis, Hilton Head has few rivals. There are nature trails and tours to other coastal sea islands. The shops and restaurants are first rate. Easy day trips from Hilton Head are Savannah 30 miles to the south and Charleston 70 miles to the north. Hilton Head is a great tourist destination. Fun, safe, with something for everyone.
