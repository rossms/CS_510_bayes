Much nicer than I expected. The best part about Daytona is that they allow you to drive on the main drag of the beach. It's this giant wide beach, with two sand lanes, and people just cruise up and down with a cooler in the car, taking in the sites. Not a bad way to spend a sunny day - especially in a convertible.
