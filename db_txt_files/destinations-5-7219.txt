Salzburg is a terribly beautiful city/town surrounded by mountains with tons of stuff to do and see. Mozart's birthplace, the Archduke of Salzburg's Estate, the Salzburg castle, nearby is Hitler's Eagles Nest mountain retreat, and Salt Mines where you get dressed up in miner's suits and ride the rails down into the mountain side ( a great trip). Everything, down to the shop signs in Salzburg are ornate, even the Mcdonald's has a cast iron sign instead of the usual big plastic M.
