I remember when this store first opened. I thought it was a great store with good casual clothes. Then, I became unhappy with the styles and the quality so I stopped going. A few months ago, I went back into Eddie Bauer and found a jacket and a shirt that I liked and were moderately priced. I also saw a bunch of other stuff that I would have willing to buy. With respect to its competitors, Eddie Bauer's quality is better than Old Navy and it is more reasonably priced than The Gap, J. Crew, or Banana Republic.
