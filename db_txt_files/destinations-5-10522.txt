The best out of the camel exotics and one of the best cigaretes I've ever smoked. Very rich, excelent for playing pool and having a drink with your friends. The rest of the exotics was quite unimpressive. Has a bit of a sweet taste to it, very pleasant. Feels like it is full flavor, but not as strong a regular camel filters. Very expensive, runs about 6.50 in the few sotres you can find it. Buy online for around 4 a tin. Give it a try, these are good!
