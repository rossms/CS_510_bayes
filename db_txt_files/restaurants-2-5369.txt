This is the kind of place that will always have clientele so long as Houston's baby boomer population is still young enough to drive a car. There is no atmosphere, a boring menu selection, (most of which I could prepare myself at home for half the cost and twice the taste), typical chain restaurant-type service, and did I mention a boring menu selection? Once people begin to realize that restaurant executives refer to these places as "concepts" and not restaurants, maybe they'll begin to phase out of business.
