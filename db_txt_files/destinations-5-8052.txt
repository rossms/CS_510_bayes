I like the capitol building, has a great flare with the moat representing the sea and the pillars representing the palms. Used to be, years ago,before crazies and terrorists, you could walk right into the Govs office and shake his hand, been there, did that, but now, I am sure it is changed. Nice building however, the architecture of Honolulu is very interesting, a nice blend of many cultures. Wonderful to spend a day walking around downtown and seeing all the beautiful buildings and their grounds.
