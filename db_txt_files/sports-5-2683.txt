Gotta say, even though I am definitely NOT a Yankee fan, Joe Torre has always impressed me with his classy behavior on and off the field. He obviously knows how to motivate a group of athletes to reach its fullest potential. And, he has overcome a great deal of personal adversity to make it to the top. I salute you, Mr. Torre. Any chance you could come manage the Orioles for awhile?
