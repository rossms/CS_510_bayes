Lions doing fairly well this year, in spite of the obviously great loss, of Mr. BS. The past few games have brought glimpses of the old Lions back into my head, but it certainly seems their better without Mr. RB, now ALL of them can play. If he comes back next year as I've heard, Bobby Ross ought to sit his butt on the bench for the remainder of his contract!
