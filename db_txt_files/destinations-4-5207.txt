Over rated? Yes- but a wonderful place to live if you have the $$$$. I have always had fun in California and enjoyed the beaches, desert, forests and mountains- as well as its glittering and at times gritty urban landscapes. Lots to do- quirky people that are not boring, and a benign climate along the coast that is nearly perfect.
