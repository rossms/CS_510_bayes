Flat out the most compelling, well-written book about basketball that I have ever read. Wolff's love and respect for the game come through on every page, and his trek around the world in search of various hoops hotbeds is riveting. Anyone who loves basketball would love this book, as would anyone who appreciates travel and the differences between cultures around the world. From a frightening hoops battle for national supremacy in Angola, to Bhutan's hoops crazy king, to what it feels like to accept a back door pass from Pete Carrill - Wolff really gets to heart of the game. Highly recommended.
