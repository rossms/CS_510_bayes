Steve Martin's not as funny as he used to be, so it's a good thing Queen Latifah is on her game in this one. She seems to play this part just right. She's got several hilarious scenes. The plot is far-fetched, and I swear I've seen somebody do Eugene Levy's performance in an earlier film, but I can't remember which one. That being said, I would recommend it. There are enough laughs to get you through the occasional lull.
