Better than I had expected. It actually had an interesting plot, average effects and solid acting. Ben Affleck plays an engineer who sells out high tech companies to each other, duplicating their software. After he completes his work his memory is wiped. While Paycheck has a few plot holes, its quite unique and definitely interesting. A strong supporting cast of Uma Thurman and Aaron Eckhart make this clever, mindbender worth renting.
