I started to doubt this woman when she showed up as a slut (complete with new fake boobs) on Melrose Place, but she wised up and went back to making interesting TV in Charmed. She seems to be quite personable and real compared to many grown-up child actors. She's also very intelligent. My guess is that she'll be around for a very long time. Plus she is beautiful.
