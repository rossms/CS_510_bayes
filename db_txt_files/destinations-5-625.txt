Taxco is a quaint little town and a nice place to do some shopping especially for silver. If you are in Mexico City, make the drive to Taxco to buy any silver you will receive a much better product and higher grade of silver. It is very laid back and you are not harassed by the street vendors like you are in Mexico City or other typical tourist locations. Some of the shops are like walking through miniature silver museums where craftsmanship is superb. As with most churches in Mexico the main church in town is another example of fine architecture.
