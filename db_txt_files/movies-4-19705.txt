This one was very well done, and while we will probably never know for sure who he really was Jack the Ripper, it does give some interesting viewpoints, like the fact that it could have been someone looking out for the interests of the royal family. The acting, directing and writing were all done very nicely. Watch the DVD if you can, it has a lot of extra stuff that will interest any fan of Ripper lore.
