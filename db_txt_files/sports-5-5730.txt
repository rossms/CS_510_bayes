Oh, John, you're so sexy. We all know how much that has to do with basketball, right. Hey, everybody, make fun of dook fans for not understanding the game. Not because they're good, but because THEY DON'T UNDERSTAND BASKETBALL, for god's sake! Hell, they're from rich sections of New England. They know raw hoops like we know caviar! Think about it. Their players start blushing when somebody gets in their face! - besides Ewing. Anybody else smell p&ssy? I do. Go get 'em OK St country boys!
