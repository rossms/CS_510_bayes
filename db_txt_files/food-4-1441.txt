They're just good. Fun to chew, but I never actually taste them because once they finally break down they're in my stomach. That Amazing Fruit candy did a really good job of improving the gummy bear; it's quite impressive actually. The cartoon was fun on those weekends when the Disney Chanel broadcast for free, although the bears did not look gummy in the least little bit.
