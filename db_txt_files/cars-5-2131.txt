I usually get bored with a new car after a year or so, but after two years of Lexus SC ownership I haven't a thought of changing! Look at the features: absolute Toyota reliability, fast, 0-60 in 6 secs or less, 155mph+++, active suspension, four wheel steer, TV and navigation, electric everything! and great looks. On the downside, it needs servicing every 6000 miles and eats tyres and fuel, but you gotta pay to play!
