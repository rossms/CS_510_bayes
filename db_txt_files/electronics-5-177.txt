The overall design of this CD player series is outstanding. The one I own is about one centimeter thick, and only the size of a CD, making them very portable. They also have one of the longest anti-skip times I've seen, though advertised at 40-45 seconds. I've heard that it lasts around 51 seconds. Plus, it has a maximum battery time at over 48 hours, and it includes re-chargeable batteries.
