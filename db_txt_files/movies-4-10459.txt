This is the case study for a movie that should never have had a sequel. Police Academy was pretty funny with Steve Guttenburg in his best role other than Diner. And, Michael Winslow was the sound effects king. I also have a pretty funny story about the Police Academy series. I was in Egypt on an overnight bus trip from Cairo to Luxor and they were showing Police Academy 3 or 4 with Arabic subtitles. It's nice to see that the movies had such international success.
