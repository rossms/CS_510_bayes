El Malecon is the most famous Havana landmark. It is a stretch of concrete boardwalk that separates Havana from the sea, and if you walk along it, you are likely to be drenched by waves crashing up over the rocks. While El Malecon is nothing that stunning architecturally, it is generally full of people from all walks of Cuban life, from fathers and sons playing baseball, to couples taking a romantic stroll, to packs of teenagers, to prostitutes, etc... You should not go to Havana without planning to spend some time hanging out on El Malecon.
