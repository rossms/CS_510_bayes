This video should be #1.....It is afterall the #1 best music video ever made! Michael Jackson was the imaginative creator in music video. I remember being very scared when I saw the video for the first time. It was neat to see a mini movie/music video. It just was a neat special treat for a music video. Now the guy who did the voice was creapy, VINCENT PRICE. Michael did a great job acting his part as a villian....
