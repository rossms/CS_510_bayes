A super-fun, extremely addictive, time-passing strategy game, this one is totally awesome. The graphics may be simple, but they are vibrant and well-animated. The sound is simplistic, but the gameplay is great. Design your own coasters, customize everything from the speed of the rides to the kinds of the trees. One of the best PC games of all time.
