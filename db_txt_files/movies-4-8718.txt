Very funny and original since it is very outrageous in several scenes, including the pie scene for which the movie is titled. Worth going to the cinemas for it, as well as the video store once in awhile for repeats. Destined to be a comedy classic. Watch out for the bloopers and what they didn't want you to see tape!
