I am giving this a five only because of the wonderful Monument avenue with the statues of the great Confederate patriots. The Statue of Robert. E. Lee is magnificant and the one of J.E.B. Stuart is heroic. Great, wonderful, place of great heros. There are some bad parts to Richmond (North Richmond) but take time to visit Jerferson Davis grave site, a shrine to a great American patriot.
