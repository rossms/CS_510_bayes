these are good menthol cigs but they are harsh as hell, it takes a while to get use to them and sometimes it feels like they cut up your throat but once you have a couple you get use to them. I have yet to try marb menthols which will be my next venture but as far as im concenrned these are pretty good menthol cigs, i gave them a 4 because i havent tried any other menthol cigs yet and because at times they hurt like a bitch when you inhale
