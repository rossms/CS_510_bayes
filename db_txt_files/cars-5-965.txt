The Honda Accord is the best midsize sedan. The only car that comes close to it is the Camry. The Accord is my favorite becuase it seems less boring than Camry. Its V-6 is also more powerful 240hp vs. Camry's 192. (2003 models). Honda also offers a two door sportier version of its four door sedan. Very reliable.
