Come on folks. Lets be for real about Kentucky basketball and Tubby Smith. Cant recruit? Well, look who he has signed for next year. Better yet, look at the best recruiter in college basketball, Billy Donovan. Yes, he can recruit, he just cannot manage the egos. You must take into consideration one thing... everytime and I mean everytime that Kentuckly walks on the court, the opposing team is going to bring their A game. not just some times, but all of the times. Leading in every category but one. How can you not be a fan of Tubby Smith, whether you are a wildcat fan or a dukey....
