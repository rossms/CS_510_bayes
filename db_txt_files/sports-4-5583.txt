How can anyone say that Rashad McCants is overrated?!?!?! He's the unsung hero of the Carolina defense, and it showed when he wasn't there in the last four games. The guy has lost 15 pounds due to a combination of stress and what appears to be the flu. He comes off the bench today and drops down 3's like nobody's business... But then again, that is the phenom known as Rashad McCants. He talks crap sometimes, but hey, he can usually back it up. And to all those commenting on looks: GET A LIFE!!!!!!!!!!!
