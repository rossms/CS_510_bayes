the edyoukayshun stayt!I hate NC, after living there for several years, but i think that if NC took the other half of the Smokey mountians too, then Tennessee would have nothing. Nashville is declining already, and memphis, chattenooga, and Knoxville, never really became one of those high tech New South Cities to begin with. LOL TENNESSEE IS IN THE MIDWEST? SINCE WHEN? MAN THE PEOPLE WHO RUN THIS SITE JUST DON'T GET IT, THEY ALSO SAID THAT PHILADELPHIA WAS THE CAPITOL OF PA!!
