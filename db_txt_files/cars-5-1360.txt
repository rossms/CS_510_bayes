I had a 86 Jetta. It had over 150,000 miles on it when I got rid of it. I still wish I hadn't. I sold it to a friend who ran the car to well over 250,000 miles before he sold it. as far as I know, it is still running today. VW is an outstanding company. ALSO: Have a 02 1.8T that is a absolute gem to drive and own. I will probably have this car until it keels over dead in approximately 2015.
