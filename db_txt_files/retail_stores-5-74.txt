What I look for in a bookstore is a place to browse, and to buy in the rare cases I can't find the item online or need it immediately. Borders beats Barnes & Noble on both counts. Their stores and cafes just seem more inviting and casual than their B&N counterparts. Nearly all Borders stores seem to be of a certain size (unlike B&N, where store size varies widely) which is a good sign for selection. The title locator kiosks are a nice time-saving feature.
