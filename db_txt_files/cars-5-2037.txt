How can some people say over priced, underperforming and unreliable? These are the people who sit there and read what snotty magazines like Consumer Reports have to say about it. Those magazines only like rice-burners anyway. If you have ever driven, or even been in, a new Corvette, you will quickly realize it isn't under-performing , it will have you giggling to yourself as you drive it. The Corvette is the reason cars like the 300ZX, 3000GT, The Toyota Supra, and the Mazda RX7 are no longer in existence. Oustanding car, outstanding value, and that's why it has been around for 40 years.
