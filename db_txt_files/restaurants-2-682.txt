I think you need to be a Southerner to buy into the whole Krispy-Kreme thing. First, I think it's a horrible name. But beyond that, the doughnuts are awful. I was in my twenties when I had my first KK doughnut - it was actually in a business meeting with a whole bunch of displaced Southerner's that had ranted and raved about these amazing treats - I thought they were greasy, and unpalatable. Definitely not worth the Fedex we had arranged to have them delivered.
