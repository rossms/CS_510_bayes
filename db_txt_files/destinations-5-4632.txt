I have to say that going to Milwaukee is always an interesting experience! I love Milwaukee for it's constant festivals, concerts and parades. My favorite place in downtown Milwaukee is Brady Street. If you love coffee, vintage shops, and boutiques, Brady Street is the place to go! Whenever I go to Milwaukee, I visit Brady Street and get excellent mochas at their trendy coffee shops. There's great shopping in the area and everyone is very hospitable. I definitely recommend Milwaukee as a vacation destination!
