Strange thing about Connecticut is that it has some of the richest towns in the country but the cities are very poor. Greenich county is the second richest county in the country, behind Orange County California. Other wealthy notables outside Greenwich County are Avon, Canton, Guilford, Old Lyme, and Glastonbury. The 3 poorest cities in the country are Hartford, New Haven, and Bridgeport - these are the 3 largest cities in Connecticut.
