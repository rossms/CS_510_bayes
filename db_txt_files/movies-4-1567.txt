Good quality easy on the brain fun. Much as I respect Depp's acting ability I cant figure out what accent he was trying to do. Normally his English accents are spot on. The one weak link in the film is Keira Knightly IMO. She hasnt got the charisma or sex appeal of Angelina Jolie to be able to take on leading roles. She's pretty enough but not particularly sexy.
