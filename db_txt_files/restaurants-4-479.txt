i'm not a fast-food person (probably because I don't eat any meat or seafood whatsoever) but when I need a quick, inexpensive meal, I head over to Wendy's. Their prices are reasonable and, unlike other fast-food places, they have a few vegetarian meals that actually taste good and fresh. I also love those commercials with Dave Thomas. I am very sad to hear that he has passed away. I will miss him and his commercials. He always seemed like such a nice man.
