nice movie. Diane Lane plays a recently divorced woman who goes to Italy on a vacation and ends up buying a very old run down house. she has to hire a few guys to help with the repairs, along the way gets new friends and starts a new life. a sweet movie with some good scenes not to mention beautiful scenery in Italy.
