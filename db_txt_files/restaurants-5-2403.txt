Jack is great, has great food, clean resturants. Its always funny people bring up e-coli situation, which happened 11 years ago! Funny, other places, like Chi Chi's, McDonalds, Various supermarket chains had the same problems, but it always seems to be Jack in the Box in peoples memory. THe radical changed their food handling since then, and they are the safest fast food resturant.
