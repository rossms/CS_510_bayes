This movie was typically average, but at the same time unique because of the effects. The story was not the best, but some of the pictures were so beautiful that it must be considered art of the highest quality. The movie was actually worth seeing, just because of this. The overall impression of the movie was mysterious. The medieval feeling was also good.
