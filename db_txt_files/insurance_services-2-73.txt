My Honda was hit in front of my house, with no one driving(!!!), so they paid out $2600 to get the rear end fix. I didn't know any auto body shops, so I went with their recommended body shop - boy, their work sucked even after taking it back THREE times. I gave up after that trying to get the overspray and inferior paint work fixed. I managed to total that Honda within the next year (my fault), and the insurance policy started going through the roof - no surprise there. Their new ads are a joke - do you know who your insurance agent is? Yeah, we'll ream you with the premium.
