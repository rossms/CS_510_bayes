I really liked this one. It's not only about relationships, and finding the right guy - it's about parents dying, plodding through a career that you begin to expect isn't what you need, losing control of your health. And somehow coming out of it all as the person you've grown up to be. I thought it was a pretty amazing novel - and I'd highly recommend it.
