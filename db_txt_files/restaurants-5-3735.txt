I think Cici's is the best pizza around. You just have to know how to order, they will make a pizza any way you want and bring it to you. I always order the pizza with lots of extra cheese and tell them to go light on the sauce. One more tip, try dipping pizza in the white cheese sauce, they don't make much profit when I eat there as I have them pile on lots of cheese. Try ordering a pizza the way you like it and give them the details. They will soon become your favorite pizza chain too.
