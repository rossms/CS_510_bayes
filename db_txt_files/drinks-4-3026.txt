I had to pull an all-nighter last night to study for a Calculus final. I must say, under ordinary circumstances, I would never consume an energy drink, or any carbonated beverage for that matter (I just don't like them). However, desperate times call for desperate measures. My friend who is practically a professional caffeine drinker told me not to take it all at once or I would be too freaked out to study and then crash and pee myself, so I took it in sips all night and it helped. Tastes nasty though.
