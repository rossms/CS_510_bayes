BLIMPEE IS BY FAR THE BETTER OR THE SUB SHOPS AS COMPARED TO SUBWAY (SORRY JARED). IT HAS A BETTER OVERALL TASTE, NOT THAT SUBWAY IS BAD OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT, I JUST LOVE BLIMPEE MORE. SOMETHING ABOUT THE FLAVOR OF THEIR OIL & VINEGAR DRESSING ON THE LETTUCE AND TOMATOES AND ONIONS ON A TURKEY AND CHEESE SANDWHICH KEEPS ME COMING BACK.
