In the late 80's the Indians discovered that some of the barren farmland on the eastern side of the state was actually their property. They built Foxwoods - which is completely massive and for a short time in the early 90's it was the biggest casino in the world. Foxwoods now draws sort of an older crowd, as Mohegan Sun (in Norwich, about 15 minutes away) added some hot clubs and nightlife. The casinos added tons of jobs, revenue, and tourism into the state and have been a huge success.
