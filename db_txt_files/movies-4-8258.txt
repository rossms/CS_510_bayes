I remember liking this so much when it came out in theaters that I went back the next night to see it again. Very funny in parts, and overall, very well done. But I don't know that it will continue to age very well -- it seems like two decades of non-sequitars on David Letterman have made John Cleese's brand of comedy a bit passe.
