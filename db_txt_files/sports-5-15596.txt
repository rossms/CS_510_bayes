Greatest all around quarterback ever. He will find a way to beat you. He can do it with the arm or legs. Mcnabb is the most determined player i've seen in years. I mean, he is responsible for 60% of the #1 team in football's offense, that says how versatile he is. The addition of owens will make him even more deadly.
