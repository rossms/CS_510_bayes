You play to win the game!!!!! Love Herm!!! Jets need more input and improvisation from Chad this season (take the chains off the franchise!). Oh and staying healthy would be nice. Like Herm's choice for Defensive Coordinator. Attack, attack, attack. If McCariens can be the guy, Jets should be fun to watch this year.
