I have enjoyed all of Crowe's films. His work as both director and writer is phenomenal. He manages to take characters and really bring them to life. He gives them depth and emotion, creating popular characters that show human flaws, along with good attributes. He has a good hand in painting humanity. I particularly enjoyed Say Anything, Jerry Maguire and Almost Famous. His films flow properly, always with a terrific score and talented actors. A truly great and unique director.
