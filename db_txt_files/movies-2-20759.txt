Every Frickin week I come in here and it's the same comments! Castles don't have phones, arsehole! The experience of watching the movie with a knowledgeable crowd rates a 5. Watching the dvd at home rates a 4; you can get some choice comments on an alternate soundtrack, but don't get the satisfaction of throwing stuff at the screen.
