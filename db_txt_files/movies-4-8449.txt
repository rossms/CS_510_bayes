Just as funny as the original, this totally cracked me up. Dr. Evil is absolutely hilarious, Fat Bastard - - what a name! And Austin Powers himself. Man is this funny. Mike Myers will prove to be the new great comedian. I eagerly await the third installment - - Goldmember. I hope Mike Myers doesn't ruin it, but I doubt it. Just don't do any, or much, fart jokes. See this. Summary: JUST AS FUNNY AS THE ORIGINAL, HILARIOUS.
