I changed from Cingular to T-Mobile and have been very happy. I would rather drop a call than unknowingly get charged roaming like with Cingular. Cingular is deceitful and they're still trying to bill me for $650 because I talked from my phone in L.A. That's why I got T-Mobile because if it's not in an area they don't cover (which is rare) it doesn't connect. But there's also a feature you can use to bypass TMobile and connect to another mobile phone's tower in case of an emergency. Now that's service! I've been with TMobile for over a year and have traveled all over the U.S. I've never been happier.
