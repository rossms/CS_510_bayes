This game is very well thought out. It's fun, challenging, and very detailed. I am amazed by how realistic some things in the game are. Basically, you are a crook and you have to take on several missions around a huge city called Liberty City. You steal cars, shoot people, dodge the police, etc. The radio stations are hilarious, especially the Chatterbox talk radio station. One warning though...do NOT drive right after playing this game. You get the urge to drive onto the sidewalk and run over fire hydrants :P
