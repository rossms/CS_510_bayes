I hated this cheese when I was a kid. That was because the first time I tried a bite it had just been taken out of the refrigerator and had all the flavor of my little yellow rain boots. When I developed a little more patience I realized that waiting until this (or any other cheese) to warm to room temp really pays off! Swiss is great on sandwiches and a wonderful addition to any cheese tray. My favorite is either the Loraine or Baby Swiss, which seem a little creamier than regular Swiss.
