Fine place by the Delaware River. I would have seen more, including North Philadelphia to give a definite rating. However I see how aesthetic it is- there are many parks. There's a welcoming dowtown area, nice museums, great universities and a fine history. If I were to move into another place, this city would likely be my best bet.
