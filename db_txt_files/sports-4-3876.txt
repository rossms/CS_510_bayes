On every great team, there is one man who holds things together. He may not be the best player, or the loudest, but if you take him away, the team falls apart. Tony Perez was such a player on the Big Red Machine of the 1970's. An outstanding RBI man and a steadying presence in the clubhouse. The demise of the Red's dynasty began with his trade. A class act who deserves his spot in the HOF.
