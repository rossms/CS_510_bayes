Really cool people and nice beaches, but that is really all there is. It's kind of neat to see all of the Japanese tourists flocking to see Green Gables (Anne of Green Gables is inexplicably HUGE in Japan). The entire island shuts down during the winter though. Half the businesses close and everyone but the residents leave. It's the most densely populated province only because it's not large enough to have open spaces; it's predominantly rural anyway. Wonderful place for roughly two fifths of the year, so it gets 2 out of 5.
