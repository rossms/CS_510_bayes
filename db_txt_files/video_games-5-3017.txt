EXCELLENTE! Does'nt have the old muscle cars though, and do I love muscle cars. Nice super car additions though, especially the Esperante and the fact you can now BUY the COBRA(427 SHELBY)is a BLESSING. The new Gran Turismo 4 is going to have 500 cars! Go to my code site: www.freewebs.com/grantheftturismo/ Its got a whole lot o' codes for PS2, X-BOX, GameCube, N-64, and PC!!!!
