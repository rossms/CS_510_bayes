I've been a Steeler fan since I knew what football was about. I'm not a band wagon rider . I've stuck with them through the Cliff Stout and Bubby Brister years clinging to the hope that things could and would turn around. Now we finally have an offense thanks to Tommy Madox. Getting Stewart out of the QB role is the best move the organization has made since getting Brister outta there. The Steelers are always a contender and will soon be in the Super Bowl again going for that one for the thumb (S.B. ring).
