Be prepared for a very long movie; it's a movie about traditions and breaking them. It has a fun and lively musical score to accompany a very down-to-earth storyline. The dancing was very fun to watch as well. This is not for people with short attention spans--it takes up 2 video casette tapes. Otherwise, definately worth watching in my book.
