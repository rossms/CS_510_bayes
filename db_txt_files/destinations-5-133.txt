My husband and I have been to KL several times in the past ten years. Every time we go we marvel at the changes and continue to enjoy both the modern and older parts of the city. The last time we went was about a year ago. We took the free tour up the Petronas Towers and really enjoyed the view. We took a lot of pictures and would have liked more time, but the tour guide made sure that all of us left at the same time. BTW, you have to get tickets for the free tour. It is best to go early in the morning to get your tickets and then return later in the day to take the tour at the time noted on the tickets.
