As PBeavr said, it is very expensive for just chicken. However, sometimes it is worth the cost when you don't feel like frying the chicken yourself and it tastes really good. KFC is still the best fast food chicken place around. They have the experience and the recipe and I don't see how any other chain will ever be able to surpass them.
