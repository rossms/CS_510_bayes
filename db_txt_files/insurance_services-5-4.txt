I have been with Amica for 6 years, and recently was hit by a kid losing control of his vehicle. Amica was awesome, quick to get the info and make sure all the bills were getting paid. My rates are comparable to my neighbors, but my service is much better. Even my attorney told me they are excellent to deal with.
