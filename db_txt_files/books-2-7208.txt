I found the 1st and 2nd book in this series to be good. But the books to follow have been more than dissapointing! Goodkind relentlessly preaches to the reader on morals and values etc. Meanwhile, the characters and plot become increasingly dull and predictable. I would recommend this series only to a dull-witted reader or soap opera fanatic who must have characters names and key events drilled repeatedly into their small minds.
