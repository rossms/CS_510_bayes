I've been with USBank for about 6 years now, and I've never had one single problem. Yeah, I overdrew my account once, but I'm pretty sure that was my fault. For all the bad-raters, it's always a good idea to make sure you have available money in your account BEFORE you start spending it. I guess lack of common sense can be frustrating and can cost you quite a bit of money.
