I think the guy is great hands down. But the truth is if I vote for him it will be a well needed feather in his cap. But when the elections have passed. And we are all living our day to day lives. I WILL NOT live with Bush in office! Between the evils Bush is no dought the worst. Sorry my freind I will not throw my vote away. I am Going to vote for Al Gore. If Al Gore was way ahead in the polls I would vote for Ralph.
