Citadelle Vodka, like the more recognizable Grey Goose,: is a product of France; comes exquisitely bottled; and has a hint of citrus in its flavor. But, unlike its overrated compatriot, it delivers a palatable smoothness that won't disappoint. Addendum: How ironic! Three relatively obscure vodkas (Citadelle, Effen and Krolewska), that I had rated with 5 stars, all received a 3-star rating without comment in one day's time.
