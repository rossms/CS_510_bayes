Guinness in a bottle is not worth drinking, but a draught Guinness is an experience. Draughts vary, since Guinness exports at least half a dozen slightly different blends, but the only questionable Guinness Draft I ever had was at the Elephant Castle in Winnipeg, Manitoba. The best was at the Guinness Brewery at St. James Gate, Dublin.
