this state probably has the most pollution out of all the southern states. Because of the heavy industry here, they have ruined alot of the natural beauty. But I think the people and heritage is wonderful in this state. And I could spend months loving and visiting New Orleans and Baton Rouge. I just love those cities. I am just scared of all the pollution, that is all. I get sick thinking of what they have done to the Mississippi. :( Because of this, I give LA 2 stars. :(
