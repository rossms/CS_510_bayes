I've always been a cowboy fan. and always hearing how barry was better than emmitt. based on the team that they were on. and, that barry retired early, rising the question if he would have stayed. if ands or buts, you cant use that, because you dont know. maybe he would've gotten hurt or something. my whole point is that here Emmitt stayed in, and played throughout his career, and there's no denying that he's the best because the stats prove it. I'm missing emmitt, and not seeing him in the backrfield for the cowboys anymore. #22 EMMITT SMITH, THE BEST OF ALL-TIME!!!
