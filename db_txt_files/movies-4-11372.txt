This movie wasn't as good as the first, which most sequels usually are not, but it had its moments. There was more comedy than real action sequences in the movie, but the action scenes were very well done in my opinion. Then, of course, there is the tribute to Singing in the Rain. That in itself gave this movie my vote. There were also many older songs throughout the movie, such as 'Time of the Season' and 'One'. Also, the out-takes at the end of the movie are alone worth going to see the movie! I would suggest kicking back with a group of friends late at night and watching this movie sometime to anyone.
