Charleston is a treasure: the most beautiful city in the South, maybe the entire country. Great architecture, beautiful beaches, nice 'Old South' people, not at all loud and obnoxious like Dallas or Atlanta. Some of the atmosphere of New Orleans without Orleans-type problems. The only reason not to go it that you'll never want to leave.
