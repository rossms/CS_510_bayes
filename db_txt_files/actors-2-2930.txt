Should stick to commerical voice-overs. Hasn't had a meaty role in ages. Was a very promising actor when he first came up but has degenerated into just another lardass Hollywood hangeraround. He is a notably bad judge of scripts, and this shows in the several clinkers he's appeared in. This includes those juvenile and ridiculous Star Wars films. Have you taken a recent look at any of those turkeys? They haven't aged well, which indicates they were crap to begin with.
