I've been dipping Cope for 25 years! It always does satisfy for me! I usually Dip LC, but sometimes dip snuff. It packs ok, after you get it in there. Nothing better than a lip full of Cope in your lip! I brush my teeth, then throw in a little peroxide with my toothpaste, leaving it in for a few minutes. Helps my lip, and keeps the teeth white!
