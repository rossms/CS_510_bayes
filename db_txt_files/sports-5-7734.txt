If you don't know who he is it is because you don't know the history of the game. He wasn't just a great jump shooter, he had an all-around game and great athleticism (especially when you factor in how little they trained back then). I'd compare his athleticism to Manu Ginobili. Plus, he popularised the jump-shot, forever changing the game. That alone makes him great.
