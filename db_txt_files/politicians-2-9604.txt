As a fellow born-again Christian, I want to give him a high rating. But it seemed that he tried to serve the Lord and serve his liberal political base at the same time. When push came to shove, he chose the latter. I would vote for him today if he would run again, and this time reject all ungodly influences in favor of his Christian principles. When, in the 1980 election, he tried to paint Mr. Reagan as a racist and war-monger (two vicious and baseless lies), he crossed the line. He was a terrible failure. But I hope we get to meet each other in Heaven one day.
