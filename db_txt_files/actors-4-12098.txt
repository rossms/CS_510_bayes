I've not been able to see many of her films but the few I have seen she has impressed me. The most recent one she did that I saw was Harlan County War which is a story about events which occurred where I live. I was fortunate enough to have met Holly and her sincerity and nice personality impressed me to no end. I think the world of her and look forward to seeing her in more films.
