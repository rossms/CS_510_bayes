Barnone was exactly that. i have been wondering what happened to them, it's nice to see i'm not alone. chocolate with chocolate wafers, with more chocolate filling and nuts ...MMMM! MMMMM! Why they changed it and added the caramel i'll never know. It was the original make-up that made it unique in the first place. There are a million caramel bars. Somewhere...maybe a remote truck stop in Barstow...or a vending machine in Bora Bora.. i will find you Barnone......some day
