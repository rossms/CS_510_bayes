I must say I agree with some of the other posters that Triscuit is a great cracker. Or Wafer. I enjoy using these when i am in the mood for a snack. They are great for putting cheese slices, or meat, or peanut butter on.. I like making little Trisciut sandwiches,and as Shroomwoman pointed out, this is a strong cracker so it holds up well and is not as apt to fall apart. Not to mention these are just good tasting wafers. Sometimes i just like them by themselves.
