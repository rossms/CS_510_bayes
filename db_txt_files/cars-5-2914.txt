No matter how long you debate Mustang vs Camaro, it will always be known; a car must win the IROC (Internation Race Of Champions) in order to call their vehicle the IROC edition! And in '69 with the 396, and today with the SS, Mustangs near and far bow their heads when the true Chevy thunder Stomps them down. When I look in my rear view mirror and see a Mustang, I know there will never be a day when Ford can beat Chevy.
