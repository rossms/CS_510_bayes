Poor learning environment due to recent hospital merger, and political power struggles. John Silber rules the organization with an iron hand (no pun intended) and that inflexibility is evident throughout all of BU including the medical school. I also resent the burden of $200,000 in student loans when BU paid Dan Goldin $1.8 million dollars last November not to take the president position.
