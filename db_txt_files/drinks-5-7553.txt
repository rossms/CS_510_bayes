I like spicy food and things, so maybe I'm crazy but I thought that this vodka was great with the pepper kick to it. I chugged a bottle once with a buddy(on a dare) and then had to go buy another the next weekend cause we both thought it was that damn good. Not for those who don't like spice, or things with a kick!!
