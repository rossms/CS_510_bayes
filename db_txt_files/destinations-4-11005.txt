Not as good as PKI, but a good place to spend some time. Most of the coasters are pretty lame, and their newst one, Greezed Lightning, is a complete waste of time, but Chang, T2 and the Twisted Sisters more than make up for the haertbreakingly slow and sorry Roadrunner, Roller Skate, and Thunder Run. Chang is a 64-mile-an-hour standup coaster with three loops and an incredible adrenaline rush. T2 is a steel suspended coaster with no actual loops, but a lot of twisting. You'll spend more than enough time in the lines, but usually it's worth it.
