This movie was a pleasant surprise to me. Naturally, being the artistic movie that it is, the first hour of the movie was slow, drawn out, and strictly setting up the connection between 3 seemingly unconnected stories. Up until that point, the movie was only worth 3 stars. The last half of the movie got even stronger, and presented a twist to the story that answered all the remaining questions that I had about the movie. The screenplay was great and the acting was even better. Nicole Kidman deserved all the awards and accolades she garnered from this performance!!!
