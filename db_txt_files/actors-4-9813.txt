She's a darling actress. The first movie I saw her in was Freeway with Keifer Sutherland in 1996. Any Reese fans who haven't seen or heard about this movie has to see it. She might've been a little younger but she gave it her all in this dark picture. I knew when I saw it that she was going to be big.
