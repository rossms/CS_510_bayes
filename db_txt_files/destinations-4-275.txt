This is a very nice city to visit and does not have the oppressive hot Australia climate of so many other places down under. The Aussies built a Dingo fence in the 1880's to protect southeast Austrlalia from the ravages of that voracious carnivore, and Melbourne does not have a dingo problem. Few babies are stolen there, as I understand it.
