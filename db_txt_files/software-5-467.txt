Adobe Acrobat is one of the most essential programs available, at least the reader. A full version of Acrobat allows one to print a soft copy of any document in a format that can be opened, read and printed by anyone with Acrobat or Acrobat Reader. The latter is free to download. For example, one can print a WordPerfect document that can be opened, read and printed with the same fonts, graphics, etc without having WordPerfect. The bottom line is that Adobe Acrobat is one of the best software packages around for sharing information over the Internet.
