This movie started off very good and interesting, although there was bad language in it. It was interesting and a good science fiction. Jobe (the man who was pushed around so much) started to stand up to those people who pushed him around, which was good. But, this movie ended horribly as far as the moral rating is concerned. In the end, it was about Jobe getting revenge on all the people who hurt him and he proved to us the old saying is true 'power corrupts.' Jobe became an evil, power hungry man. Plus there were scenes in it which looked demonic.
