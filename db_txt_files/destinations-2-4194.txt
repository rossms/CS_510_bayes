As a southern city, Charlotte is OK. Not quite up to par on the sophistication scale as other cities throughout the country. Its a little more classy than Memphis, Nashville, and Birmingham but nothing compared to Atlanta. As a young person that thrives off of a sophisticated progressive lifestyle, I hated Charlotte. The family oriented person that is looking to escape the urban jungle of larger eastcoast cities its a decent place. Just make sure you have a decent job before you get there.
