I like dumb comedies but even I was skeptical about this after the gratuitously dumb trailers. How wrong was I? Not only is this funny from beginning to end, it's got the same warm heart that distinguished Wedding Singer and Something About Mary. Sure all the guys are sex-obsessed but this isn't the unfunny misogny of Porky's; surprisingly, it's much smarter than that.
