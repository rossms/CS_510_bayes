I loved this book. This is the kind of book that many people cannot put it down for hours. My sisters and I have read the books about three times each and can't get enough. I have heard of rumors that they are going to make a movie of her books. I believe that i won't want to see it because, I as a kid, have a large imagination and movies narrow what I can think.
