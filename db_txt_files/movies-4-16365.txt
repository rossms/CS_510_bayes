On a scale of one to ten it's a seven so I'll give it the benefit of the doubt and round up. Individualistic plot that opens your mind to a new idea. The actors give solid performances, but none of them are really spectacular. I would definitly suggest this movie if for no other reason than it is different from other recent movies.
