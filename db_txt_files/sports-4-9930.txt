This is a fun team to watch, but the foundation is shaky. If anything happens to Kidd, the whole party comes crashing down. Mourning was smart move for the money, but you have to wonder if he can still play ball. Byron Scott may be this team's weakest link and in spite of the media coverup, it's obvious his players agree. As much good as Thorn has done in the front office, you have to wonder what he was thinking by picking up Dikembe at $18 million/year. That's bad people policy. No wonder Martin wants a max contract.
