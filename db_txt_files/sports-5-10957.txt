Even though Clemson is as young a team, coach bowden is taking a beating. This really makes no sense. Consider the small amount of returning players and the large amount of new players and tommy's having a great year with more to come. Losing to georgia was inevitable. With thier depth they can run with any team. Lay off Tommy, after what they did to g.tech you should look at what can happen wwhen you doubt a bowden.
