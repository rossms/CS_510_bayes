funny movie.Two different men a snob and a slob end up with each other on a trip home to Chicago. One is on his way for Thanksgiving. Steve Martin is good as the up tight snob who wants to get home to his family and he and John Candy an easy going slob who kind of get stuck with each other taking planes. trains and autos to get to Chicago. the difference in the guys is the funny part. Of course they end up friends in the end. John Candy is great as the nice guy who sells bathroom curtain rings. Fun to watch and a lot of laughs in this road movie.
