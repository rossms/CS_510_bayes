I went there for a study abroad trip this summer and it far exceeded my expectations. I figured it would be really poor, and like a typical poor country. But it's not bad, it's more like a middle class country. I spent most of the time in Cuzco which is a very beautiful town set in the middle of the Andes. They have a rich and extensive native history and the some of the Spanish sites in Lima, such as the national church, are very beautiful. I'd definitely recommend it.
