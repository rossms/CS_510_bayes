One of the more bizarre videos of the early '80s (back in the golden age of music videos, before Pepsi started sponsoring those awful flashy ones, and rock bands treated videos as ego trips). The May Day celebration----the pretty young maidens----the elf. Lead singer Ivan looking totally tripped-out. What's not to like?
