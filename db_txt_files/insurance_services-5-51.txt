I had the best experience w/ Progressive Insurance - I was hit by someone that was insured w/ Progressive, the jerk would not return the reps calls or letters. They gave their insd fair opportunity to dispute my statement then found there own insured at fault, they evaluated the claim very fairly and quickly. I will continue to recommend Progressive Insurance to everyone!
