Great lipper here.Skoal is entirely over rated,no buzz and too much artificial flavor(mint flavors are great tho).Also at $5.00 a can,you can get 2 cans of the great tasting grizzly.This packs a GREAT buzz in all their flavors(mint,straight and wintergrean),the cuts are just right,packs well and stays together well in your lip and has a long lasting great flavor!definetly worth a try,at $1.75,you cant beat it.5 stars from me
