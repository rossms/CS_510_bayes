Considering the type of movie this was, I have to say that it was totally entertaining! This was my first Jackie Chan movie and let me tell you, he is amazing. He has this mischevious grin that lights up his face and of course, his stunts are incredible. And Owen Wilson was delightful as Chan's cowboy sidekick. You would think that they had worked in movies together all their life. Besides the predictable plot (what could you expect in this genre?), this movie was funny and entertaining to watch.
