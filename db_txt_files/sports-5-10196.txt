Bob Stoops has done a great job with the Sooners. He brought the Sooners from #13 to National champions in the 2000 season. I think Barry Switzer would be proud. UPDATE: The 2005 season for the Sooners is going to be a rough one. They lost 9 of their 11 starters to the draft, and now the Sooners have alot of young'ens. With Stoops coaching, Oklahoma should return to the Top 25 by next season. (I would say this season but that's pushing it.)
