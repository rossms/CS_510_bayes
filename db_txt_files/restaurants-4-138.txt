Starbucks is pretty good. They have a large menu to pick from offering all kinds of drinks ranging from a regular cup of coffee, sodas, fancy type coffees, and fancy cold drink concoctions.The only bad part is it is awful expensive . I only buy the fancy type drinks when i am in the mood to have a treat. I do cringe a bit at the thought of spending $3.00 or more for a drink.
