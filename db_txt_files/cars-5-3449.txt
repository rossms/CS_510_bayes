I own a 4wd soft-top which I have driven for two years.I have had no problems and in my opinion, the quality is tops.I find the car fun to drive and the power is adequate for my needs. I read a lot of complaints about the RAV being underpowered, but when I bought the vehicle I wasn't looking for a hot rod. It gets between 23 and 25 mpg mostly in city driving.
