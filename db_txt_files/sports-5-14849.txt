Perhaps the most underrated running back in NFL history, what irks me is the way he was treated at the tail-end of his career by Al Davis. But Marcus Allen was a great running back blessed with speed and cat-like reflexes. He was slippery to the defenses who were specially designed to stop him. Who can forget Allen's 191 yard, MVP-performance against the hapless Washington Redskins in Superbowl XVIII? Allen definitely deserved a better fate that the one Davis gave him.
