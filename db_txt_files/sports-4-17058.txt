Isn't it interesting how we become fans of the various athletic teams? For years, Arizona had no pro football team (still don't) so I had to pick a team. When I played high school football, our coach would not let us wear our hair long; said it was for team unity. Well, that was 1971-72 and the Dolphins were kicking butt. Kiick, Csonka, Scott, Morris, Swift all those guys had long hair, mustaches, etc. So, I adopted them as my team and have ever since! Go Dolphins!
