Although Chivas can't quite compare to an entry-level, single-malt whisky, it is about the best of the 12-year old blends. Smooth and inoffensive while not altogether without character, for my taste, it is enjoyed best on the rocks, in which case it makes an excellent apertif or an accompanyment to a poker game - with a good cigar.
