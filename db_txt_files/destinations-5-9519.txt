This landmark alone makes me proud to be British. The first place for any foreigner to visit and a tourist hotspot. Whenever I get visitors from abroad it feels great showing them a monumental piece of British history. If you look on any London postcard and they feature famous landmarks you can gurantee Big Ben and the Houses of Parliament will be on there.
