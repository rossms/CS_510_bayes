Texas isn't a great state to vacation at, but it's a wonderful one to actually live in. Great character...Texans take a lot of pride in their state, almost as much as in the nation! Summer's are blazing, so we keep air conditioning on at full blast. But winters can get cold enough to snow in February. A lot of people consider Texas to be separate from the South. Some cities, people will sport accents, others, there's no accent to be found. I don't know quite how to describe what makes Texas so great. By the way, everything steve7138 is ranting about is absolutely false.
