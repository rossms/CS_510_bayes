Its a good school... as with all education, you get out of it, what you put into it. You can tell by reading some of these reviews that these people are just miserable to begin with. I have a Bachelor of Science in Business through State University of New York and went to UOP for my Master of Science in Computer Information Systems. It was worth it and I would do it again. Dont let these negative people who spend too much time on this site influence your decision.
