Leased a 2001 Discovery. We are in our last year and WILL NOT get another one! We love the looks, room and utility, but, we had to have the car towed TWICE. The first time at about 800 miles when the fan belt came off. The second time was when the ignition switch failed. I have had many new cars, but NEVER have had to be towed in my life. The service is outstanding, but when you get to know your service rep by first name something is very wrong.
