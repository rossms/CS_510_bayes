I'm addicted to Jelly Belly. I hate Jelly Beans except for the ones from Jelly Belly. Like it has been said, pick flavors that you'd like in their 'natural' form. This company makes a really good job at replicating actual flavours so if you don't like them to start with, dont get them. I think its a great low-cal no-fat candy that has incredible taste and range of flavors!
