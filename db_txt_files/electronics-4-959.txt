Motorola StarTAC is a small portable phone that fits nicely into a coat pocket. The phone can be purchased in either an analog or digital version. Functions are code driven (ie press function and 5 button to check battery) instead of scrolling through a menu. Physical battery size for the StarTAC is small so there is a maximum of two days of use. However, for an added expense extra battery packs can be purchased to increase battery life up to 7 days.
