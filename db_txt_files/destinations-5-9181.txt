I've just returned from a wonderful visit to the Outback of Australia, and then to Queensland purposely to visit the Australia Zoo after watching so many Animal Planet programs in which Steve Irwin (Crocodile Hunter) and his wife Terri are featured. Two people I'd like to nominate for their selfless devotion to world wildlife. My absolute favourite is the exhibit (if that's what you call it) was the swimming tigers--AMAZING--and the fact that the human keepers were in the enclosure with the tigers. I highly recommend making the visit to Australia Zoo!
