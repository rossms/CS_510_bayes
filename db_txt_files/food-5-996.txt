This is as good as sugary cereal gets. Granted, the blueberry taste is definitely artificial, but so is any fruit taste in any fruity cereal. The blue pieces actually taste quite good. Turns your milk blue too! For marshmallow lovers, the cereal has some blue marshmallows as well, though it's the cereal pieces that do it for me!
