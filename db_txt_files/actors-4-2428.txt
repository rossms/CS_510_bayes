Is there a movie this guy WONT do? Samuel L. Jackson is good for several movies a year. He's always working and , to his credit, he's not bad. Still doing too much work will oversaturate you to the public. Jackson can act and will turn in a good performance in a good movie ( or a bad one), but he works too much but so far it hasnt caught up to him.
