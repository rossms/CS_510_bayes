I flew them from DC to Las Vegas (connected through Denver) and was VERY pleased with everything. Chatty, friendly crew, smooth flight, attentive service, and best of all, a small TV screen in the back of all seats. I am a geography buff and like to know what I'm flying over--and that navigational map was great. I don't need DirecTV to keep me entertained, but they offer it. And the planes are beautiful, inside and out. Love the animal pictures on the tails. Only drawback is not enough flights on the east coast, but I will fly them whenever I go west.
