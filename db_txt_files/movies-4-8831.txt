A classic, and a must-see for anyone. It has so many great lines, so many good quotes. And contrary to what some of the characters in the movie might think, makes the 70's look cool. I actually used a bit of the movie in a speech I gave about industrial hemp (George Washington actually did grow it!) Eh, just a fun fact.
