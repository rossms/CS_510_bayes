Just bought my Black Honda 450R last month. The Mods I have done are: Stage 1 HotCam, Dyno Jet Kit, LRD Full Exhaust, Uni Air Filter (no lid), 13 tooth front sprocket, Advance 1000rpm CDI Box, Pro Armor Full Nerf Bars, IMS front bumper, and the YFZ 450 can't touch this. Plus the Honda is so much more comfortable, easier to control, not as stiff a ride and easier to work on then the YFZ and the suspension is fantastic. I recommend the Honda 450R to anyone looking for a fast kick ass quad but it is definately not for a beginner.
