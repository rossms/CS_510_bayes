I'll go along with VirileVagabond about this film being more of a drama than a comedy, although it did have it's funny moments. When Melvin walks out of his shrink's office into an overcrowded waiting room and throws the punchline, "What if THIS is as good as it gets?" and some nutcase ekes out an "Oh?"...well, this was very funny stuff, but subtle. Why I give it a 4 in this category...and a 5 in any other category, is that is the most well-written screenplay since Shawshank Redemption. An absolutely delicious film.
