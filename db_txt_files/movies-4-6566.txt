Rebel is my least favorite of the three James Dean movies. Still, it was fairly cutting edge for the times. I didn't see it until I was an adult and, with its reputation and all the build up over the years, I really expected something a tad more wild. The teenagers were actually much more troubled and neurotic than mean. The entire movie was actually less disturbing and violent than most prime time television shows today. Of course, as usual, Dean put in an excellent interpretation of his character turning what could have been a very forgettable role into a piece of American cultural folklore.
