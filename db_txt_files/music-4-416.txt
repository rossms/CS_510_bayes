I think most people agree that Vers 2.0 isn't as good as the debut album. Some of the songs seem to follow on from 'Milk' which is the last song on the debut album, such as 'The Trick Is To Keep Breathing'. But there still are some powerful songs on there like 'Dumb'. At least we know they aren't afraid of trying out something new.
