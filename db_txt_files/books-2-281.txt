From what I've read, I think Morris takes too much criticism for his weird blend of fiction into this biography and not enough for simply missing the big picture of what Reagan accomplished. p.s. it is interesting that the media picks up on quotes about appearing to be an amiable dunce (misreading appearing as being ) and forgets stuff like the most courageous, principled man I've ever studied.
