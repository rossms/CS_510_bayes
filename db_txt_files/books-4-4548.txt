I did enjoy this book as a teenager (teenagers seem to view every issue in terms of moral absolutes), but it hasn't aged well for me. I think Irishgit described it best- a simple and simplistic morality play. Exactly. The older I get, the more I learn that life can seldom be seen in the context of black-and-white simplicity. I have come to see life as more nuanced, more complex than I used to imagine it, more unpredictable, and I tend to appreciate authors now who reflect this ambiguity. Steinbeck isn't one of them, at least not for me.
