Great stuff - I drink it every day. I like the lemon flavor even better than the original, and vanilla better than that. The cherry diet Coke is great too. Where I live, it's hard to find any of these added flavors unless you buy them in cans (which I won't!). But all Diet Cokes are really good, so I just get whatever I can. Among those without added flavoring, I like the taste of the caffeine-free best.
