Let's see: best renaissance art in the world, Michelangeo's all over the place, top notch artisans with shops all over the Oltrarno, fabulous babes everywhere, and history out the wazoo. Two tips: first, stay at a place south of the Arno -- much quieter and away from tourist mobs. Better yet, do Florence as a day trip from Siena. Second, to avoid the long lines at the Ufizzi and Acadamy (2 hours+) use the phone to make a reservation a day or two before. Show up at your appointed time and you can walk right in.
