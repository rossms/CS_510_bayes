Blackjack is great and I hate it! Over and over have I found myself up and down at the table. My advice (if you could call it that) never speak to the dealer and never tip the ****). Keep your mind on the game! Never listen to anyone but your gut! (Unless you are an idiot?) If someone tells you that, its a good sign not to gamble. Get off that chair and leave when you know you should!
