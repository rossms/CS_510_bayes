Out of the abounding war flicks out there, this one stands out to me because it tells a rarely told story. Focusing on the Battle of Stalingrad, it deals with one of the most important battles of the war, one often overlooked and never dealt with in Hollywood. While it is a little slow-paced, it's certainly intriguing. They did a terrific job recreating the horrific, bloody battles and the crumbling city of Stalingrad. Jude Law owns the screen in his performance of the shepherd turned sniper hero. Joseph Fiennes, Rachel Weisz and Ed Harris round out a top-notch cast. A great historical film.
