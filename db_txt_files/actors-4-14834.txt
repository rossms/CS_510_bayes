Kathy Lee is smart, and should be a talk show host. She can carry a show on her own. Now look at how she took over the David Letterman show. She was absolutely terrific. I really did not like her until I saw her on that show, but she was funny, her singing was right on, and the audience loved her. She could take over late night TV and bump all of the guys off. I had to be honest with myself and give her high ratings.
