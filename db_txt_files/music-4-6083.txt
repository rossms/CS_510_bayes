This album offers you two Metallica's, the old, good band, and the new, crappy, sell out band. The second disc is great, a re-release of the old Metallica cover songs. The first disk is awful, seeing Metallica drudge through a bunch of songs that no self-respecting heavy metal band should play, with the exception of a Misfit's cover song.
