An old time classic, reminds me of my youth! As a kid I would always choose the assorted ones, revelling in the suprise of which color would be the next one-- and savoring all the flavours-especially strawberry and grapefruit! I've forgotten all about Lifesavers-I have to admit. Maybe next time I'm waiting in line somewhere I'll buy a pack to enjoy and feel young again!
