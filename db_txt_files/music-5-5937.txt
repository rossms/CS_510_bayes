TOOL is one of the most versatile and talented bands out there today.Listen to the way they can shift from Ultraheavy Crunch to Pink Floydian tragedy without a hitch.NOT EASY.The drummer and bass player comprise one of the greatest rhythm sections ever heard.The only drawback for me is the singers voice-but his lyrics sort of make up for it.
