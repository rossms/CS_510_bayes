The first major spoof of SF that I can think of, although Woody Allen's material may not be for everyone. Still, get off that fact, the fact that it's a little bit dated, try to ignore the really annoying (yet almost funny) jazz-laced score, and you'll probably find yourself laughing at some of the better SF jokes here. 'Tis a Rip Van Winkle premise that has a 1973 man shunted into about 2173. And what a different and silly world it is!
