The Hut seems to have the magic formula. Big chunks of toppings and killer breadstix abound. Cleanliness in some of the restaurants is lacking, though. I don't know why some people complain about greasy pizza, it's PIZZA after all. It is supposed to be dripping with grease. If you don't want grease, go to Subway.
