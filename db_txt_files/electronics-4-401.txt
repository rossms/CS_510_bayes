The XV-511BK is a very good DVD player. It handles almost all disks without problem. It has great color saturation and the sound is fantastic. The transport is very quiet, the remote is good, although not programmable. The size is fairly large, presumably because of the discrete design (each stage is placed in a separate part of the chassis to isolate interference). Only shortcoming I've noticed is a lack of coaxial digital output. Not a problem for me, but might be for some. But it makes up for the lack of coaxial output with composite, s-video and component video outputs. I'd buy it again.
