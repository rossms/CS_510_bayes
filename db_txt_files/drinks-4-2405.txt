Very nice selection. They've sort of veered off a bit into more flavored teas but they're all pretty good. A little expensive I think but at the same time I credit these guys with real growth in tea consumption amongst former coffee drinkers. They really opened up the whole steeped tea world to mainstream. Read the book too and it was pretty interesting how the whole thing got started, it's worth picking up.
