A very strong performance by Jim Carrey, who takes the audience back to his early days of goofy catch phrases (B-E-A-utiful) and physical humor. Although fairly predictable, the story raises some very interesting questions that we've all had from time to time. For example, what would we do if we had the power of God? Also, this is one movie about a higher power that avoids the whole idea that heaven is only for those who do good works. It sends a message about the free will of humans and how to put certain things in God's hands because after all......He knows what He's doing!!!
