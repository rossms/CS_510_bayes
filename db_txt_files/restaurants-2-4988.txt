Definitly not the best Italian resturant out there. The food is insipid at best, which is okay because they serve it in minuscule portions anyway. They have to, any more and you will be able to taste just how bad it is. The few times I have been there, the staff has been very friendly and helpful. Unfortunatly, that is the best I can say about this place.
