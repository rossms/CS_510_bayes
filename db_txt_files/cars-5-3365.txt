It took long enough but car makers finally realized that most people who wanted an SUV wanted it to get through snow, rain, and slush to get to work, not drive off road. This vehicle is awesome. I traded an Isuzu Rodeo for this dream. Handling is super, the ride quiet, and the sound system is dynamite.
