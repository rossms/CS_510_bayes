I love his quickness and his ability to create once he is on the court. You definitely know something will happen when the ball is in his hands. However, he is not Allen Iverson. Lacks toughness, small, and cannot create his own shot. Speaking of shooting, I hope he practices a lot because it is painful to watch him throw up shots at times. Needs to join a team where he doesn't need to be the star and can keep his teammates happy until he develops some sort of jumper.
