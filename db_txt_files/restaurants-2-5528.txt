Broads just aren't that hot. A real crap shoot on the service. No liquor is a huge minus that isn't made up for by a big chest and tight shorts. Grilled cheese is priced like a NY Strip. Only plus and reason for another star is oysters are actually decent and sometimes the only option in the midwest.
