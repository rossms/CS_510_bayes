If not for bad performences by John Lithgow and Kevin Bacon, this movie could almost top Grease. Footloose is the story of a young man who moves into a small suburban town where dancing is prohibited. It will be hard getting used to that kind of living, because of his special gift of dancing. But, like anyone else would do, he starts a big war, as he teaches the town how to dance, but the town priest hates it, and won't let his daughter learn how to.
