Isiah is a GM with the complete opposite results and decision ability of that when he was a player. Granted he inherited a difficult situation in NY from Scott Layden but he has made moves and only gotten worse. His past record with other teams and leagues (CBA) is eveen a worse track record. Isiah do us Knick fans a favor....retire!!
