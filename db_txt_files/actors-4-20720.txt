I think she's talented, no doubt that she's funny. But I think she made a huge story out of her homosexuality.... it's fine being gay as long as you feel ok with it, but hey, who cares ANYWAY? The only thing she managed to do with her braveness was destroying her talent and her career. Not because it's something bad, but because Hollywood isn't ready yet to deal with that...
