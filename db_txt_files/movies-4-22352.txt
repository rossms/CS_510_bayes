I thought this movie was just a tasty morsel of goodness. I only have three words for Christopher Reeves' performance... DE-LI-CIOUS! I'm through! It was magnificent when a man such as him has the burnin' fire and the strunff to wear those tight little red underpants, ohhh! I think I sprung a leak! Anyhoo, whether he's running and flying or breaking his neck, Chris Reeves is my Super-Man!
