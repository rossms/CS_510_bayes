Las Vegas makes major changes every 6 months to a year with new casinos being built around the clock. Las Vegas is offering a more cultural stay with resorts such as The Bellagio and the Venetian. If you like art...and are up for some gambling as well, you'll enjoy both places...of course the MGM Grand, The Rio (local's favorite), Treasure Island, Mandalay Bay, and The Mirage are always great places to go. And if you don't want a casino in the hotel you are staying at, try the Four Seasons for a change of pace.
