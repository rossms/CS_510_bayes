Meijer is the best grocery option on weekends (because Kroger doesn't start their sales ads in our area until the following Monday). KILLER sales on top-name items (especially Coca-Cola); stocking up is essential. After the food deals have knocked you out, sidle on over to the electronics department and check out the television sets and DVD players; their regular prices are usually better than Best Buy, Kmart, Walmart, etc. (be warned, however: their DVDs are ridiculously overpriced). They do a whopping business, and I'm glad to see 'em thriving in this part of the country.
