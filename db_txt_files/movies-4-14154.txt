I finally rented this movie a few weeks ago and it is pretty intense. I had heard how good Hilary Swank was, but she was even better than I expected (after all, I had seen her in 90210 and she didn't exactly distinguish herself opposite Ian Zeiring). What's truly amazing is that this is best on a true story. You find yourself feeling for Brandon who definitely has his obvious faults. If you're looking for a pick-me up, look elsewhere. But, if you want to see a well-acted, interesting movie, you could do a lot worse than this one.
