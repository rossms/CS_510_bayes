New York is busy, sure, but there's no more exciting city in the United States. The restaurants are unbelievable, public transportation is a snap, the sights are amazing, the shopping is terrific, and Manhattan from the financial district to Harlem is thriving. It may be packed with people, but it's hard to argue, with the possible exception of Chicago, that this isn't the best city in the country.
