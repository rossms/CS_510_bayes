Dan Quayle got a bum rap from a media machine that doesn't have the guts to do any real investigative reporting. It's easier to sit and wait for stories - no matter how petty - to fall into their laps. Then they harp on it for weeks, and months, and years, etc. Now I'm not trying to insult anyone, but how many of you have noticed the horrible spellings in chat rooms, on forums, etc. Kinda like the pot calling the kettle black (oops, hope I'm not being politically incorrect). Dan Quayle is a good person whose star has not yet faded.
