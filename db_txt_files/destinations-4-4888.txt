Pretty cool city to go spend a few days relaxing in after a week or two on the road. The claim to fame are the Banos outdoor hot spring baths that you pay a buck or so to go sit in. We went but unless you like bathing with about 200 other people many of whom are getting wet for the first time all week then you might not like it. Still we soaked it up. The guide book told us some people would go in fully dressed, we didn't see that but we did get kicked out because we were wearing shorts and not a bathing suit?!?! The city itself was small, pretty, very casual.
