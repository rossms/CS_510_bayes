I think maybe i saw a different movie than every one else. Or maybe it is just me, that could be it...but everyone says this is the best, most funniest movie of the year....everyone raves about it, and can't wait for the TV series. I sat through this film and didn't laugh once....i barely cracked a smile.I must be missing something, because i found it to be boring, and it didn't hold my attention.
