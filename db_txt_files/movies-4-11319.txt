Pee-wee Herman is definitely someone you have to get to like his movies. Either you think he is a complete mental, or you get what he's trying to do, which is put on the act. Well, I think he's a little of both, and I enjoyed this movie. There are some very funny scenes. When you put Tim Burton and Pee-wee Herman together on one movie you can pretty much imagine what's gonna happen, and it does. But I think kids an adults will enjoy this if they give it a chance.
