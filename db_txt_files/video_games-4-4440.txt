The AOE series is an amazing achievment in real-time-strategy games. It expertly blends historical accuracy with the mechanics of a game simulation, and provides a challenging and well-balanced playing experience to boot. Not surprising from a game by Bruce Shelly, who along with Sid Meier created the venerable Civilization games. Easy to learn, difficult to master.
