We use continental airlines and they are the best. The stewardesses are extremly nice and they come over to you if you need a cd player or a blanket, or just something to munch on. They sometimes on differet flights, depening on if it's round-trip or not, they have 6 Tvs, all only having one interesting channel, usually ABC or NBC.
