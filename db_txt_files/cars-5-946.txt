I have had three Hondas in the past 16 years - 1986 Honda Accord LX, 1992 Honda Prelude, and 1996 Honda Accord EX (110,000 miles and running.) No major problems except for replacing the master cylinder three times on the 1996 Accord. Overall, I have spent more time waiting in mechanic waiting rooms for my mother's 1997 BMW than I have with all three of my Hondas. Outside of normal replacements (tires, batteries - I live in AZ, and one brake job) I haven't put more than $1,000 into repairs for any of my Hondas. They are wonderful, dependable cars. This one certainly won't be my last.
