McKie has been the player that has impressed me as much as anyone during the 2001 NBA Playoffs. Every game he seems to do all of the little things - guard the the other team's best offensive weapon, grab the big rebound, make a critical steal, hit the open man. And before you know it he ends the game with 20 points. He single-handedly kept the Sixers in the game in Game 3 of the Bucks series without Iverson. The NBA needs me more players like Aaron McKie.
