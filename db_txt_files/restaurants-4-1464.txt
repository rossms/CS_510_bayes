They make a great Cherry limeaid and vanilla Dr.Pepper. The chicken fried steak sandwiche is really good too! I like this fast food place. The burgers are twice the size of other fast food joints and the prices are about equal. The foot long chili cheese dog is a kids favorite. They also have great corn dogs!
