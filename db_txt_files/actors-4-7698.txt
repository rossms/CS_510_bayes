he is so darn cute that i feel like i might a lack of perspective on his acting skills. so i give him only four stars. the question is, during all those scenes in can't hardly wait when he just kind of stares into space with this dreamy expression on his face, would we be impressed if he didn't look the way he does? hmmmmm.
