I think Fresca is a great drink. It is very refreshing and has a good flavor for a diet drink. Although, of the diet sodas I would prefer a Diet Coke, Fresca has 5 mg less sodium and no caffeine. On a really hot day when you are good and thirsty, Fresca will actually quench your thirst where other sodas leaving still searching for a gallon of water.
