This is arguably the best musical movie of all-time. It stars Michael Pare as Eddie, the leader of a band called Eddie and the Cruisers . Tom Berenger stars as the keyboard player who tells the story. It has some mystery, some suspense, a good story, but most of all, as a musical should, it has some incredible music. Including the hit On the Dark Side and another great one Tender Years . I would definitely recommend this fantastic musical to everyone.
