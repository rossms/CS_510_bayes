Put this guy on some of the great Yankee, Reds, A,s or Braves teams or any team with a half decent bullpen and how many 20 win seasons would he have he gotten? One man does not constitute a team!! He took to the mound every game, the pressure that if he didn,t win it, his team sure wasn,t going to!!!
