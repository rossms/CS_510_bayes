I was channel surfing the other day and came across Girls Just Want to Have Fun, starring Hunt and Sarah Jessica Parker, I then remembered that Helen Hunt was in that football movie the Quarterback Princess I think..she has been acting for quite a while. She was excellent as the everywoman in Mad About You and excellent in As Good As It Gets.
