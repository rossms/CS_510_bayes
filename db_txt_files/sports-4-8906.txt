Peja has seemingly come out of nowhere this year to become the second best player on the Kings. He is among the best shooters in the game, but he is really more than just that. He can take his man off the dribble and can rebound pretty well. He's still pretty young, so expect him to continue to improve (which will be critical next year without Weber).
