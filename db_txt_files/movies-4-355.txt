all the actors gave great performances, as they were well directed. so was the tension and ancient-history-realism in the movie for the most part. the dramatic scenes were really well done. not bad for hollywood in this day and age. but i must confess the ending left me rather unfulfilled. ridley scott seems to be losing his creative edge when it comes to endings...but then so does most of hollywood.
