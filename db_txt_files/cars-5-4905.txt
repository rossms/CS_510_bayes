Awesome - Let me tell you about my test drive! Got out on a deserted two lane high way and stopped - sorry chevy guys it didn't quit runnin! I brake torqued it to 2500 RPM's and let it rip. That supercharger started whining, the exhaust was roaring (gearhead music) and the tires were smoking (they look like 2 foot wide slicks). The back window was open and before it hooked up the smoke was bellowing in the back window. That monster didn't hook up till it got in 3rd gear and it must have laid 50 ft of rubber! Only thing I've drove that matched this monster was an XJR! See the Jag comments for that story.
