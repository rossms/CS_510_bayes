I had a Dodge Stratus for a lot of years before this car. We looked at the Matrix (too tiny) and the Jetta (almost bought it) but AWD and $1,000 less trumped the sunroof. The engine is fantastic, it's only 4 cylinders, but it's 2.5 liters, the same size as the V6 in the Dodge. I've not had any problems with it, and I disagree with the folks that say it's uncomfortable on long trips; we've done several 5 and 6 hour runs with it with no discernible discomfort. My only complaint is the A/C seems a bit feeble, but otherwise, this is a terrific car!
