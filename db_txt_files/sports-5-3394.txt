Rogers Hornsby was a cantankerous player who often quarreled with other players. But his talent as a hitter and a complete player cannot be denied. A prodigious hitter who was so committed to hitting, Hornsby is said to have refused to watch movies for fear of destroying his remarkable eyesight. But .424 is most likely never again to be matched (or broken) in a single season as Rahjahs reigned havoc on the National League in 1922. Simply, Hornsby was one of the greatest ever.
