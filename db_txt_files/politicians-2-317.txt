George II was a largely ineffective King, relying heavily upon Prime Minister Robert Walpole to run the British government. Walpole was quite effective in keeping Britain out of war for the first decade of George's reign, but in 1739 George declared war on Spain, and soon after Walpole's retirement, Britain and France were constantly engaged in battle over control of North America. Indeed, Walpole was George's greatest asset, and things seemed to fall apart following his departure. Overall, George II was largely incompetent, lacking the judgment to make the critical decisions on behalf of the British.
