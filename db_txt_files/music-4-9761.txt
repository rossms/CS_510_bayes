BSB's 2nd album Millenium is one cool cd with groovy tracks like larger than life and 'thoe one are definate partt tracks. I also think the song it's gotta be you is really cool, but I would like it to be longer it's juat a tad under 3min long. I love the emotion put into back to your heart it makes me cry and it's a beautiful song. I also love thoe song don't want you back because it has a cool urban-trip beat that I like. I love this whole cd! hey! let's not forget I want it that way ! It is a cool track that sorta sounds like quit playing games with my heart form thier self-titled cd.
