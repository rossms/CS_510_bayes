This guy is a horse. Yeah, he throws gas but you don't put up zeroes the way Clemens does on gas alone. I saw a great interview with Craig Biggio, who was talking about how Clemens sets batters up. With his pinpoint control, he's able to manipulate batters' stances and even their positions in the batter's box. It broke my heart to see him lose to the Cubs last night. But I guess a mid-June 9-1 record could be worse...
