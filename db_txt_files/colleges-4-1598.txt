A gorgeous campus in a gorgeous city. A wealth of excellent academic programs. You can't beat the Puget Sound for all the opportunites to explore both a great urban culture as well as the outdoors. The rain keeps the population somewhat under control, though the city is getting crowded. The reading room in the library is phenomenal.
