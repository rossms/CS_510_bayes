For the morons that are saying he didn't win Championships Wilt had 2 of the best teams in the history of the NBA. The 1967 76ers who won about 67 games and the title and the 1972 Lakers who still hold the record for winning 33 straight games in a season and they also WON the championship that year. So he had 2 championships; so PLEASE get a clue.
