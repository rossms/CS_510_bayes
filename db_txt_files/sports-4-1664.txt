When I was around 15 or 16, I used to be able to pick up the White Sox games at night on my transistor radio. There was a fantastic announcer named Red Rush who used to call the games with a guy named Bob (I forget his last name). Rush had an infectious enthusiasm, and made the games so interesting, even when the Sox were behind, that it made me a White Sox fan. They're not my very favorite, but they're near the top. I also had the privilege of attending a game once not long before the old Comiskey Park was torn down and replaced.
