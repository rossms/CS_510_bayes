Unlike the below poster, I have finished Final Fantasy X. It has the poorest finish I've ever saw in such a game. Anyway, I have a hard time believing that these characters really even care about each other. The only bit of real unforced warmth was when lulu was holding wakka after his blitzball game. Great graphics, but graphics aren't everything.
