I have never been as emotionally affected by a song then I have with this one. Something about is just indescribably sad, I mean sure it reminds me of my childhood... but it also reminds me that I can never go back. Depending on the person, it could be the happiest or saddest song in the world. Its like magic. I almost cant handle the song.
