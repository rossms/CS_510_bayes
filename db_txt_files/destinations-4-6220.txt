I've drove through and stayed in Georgia a few times on my way to florida and thought it was a beautiful state. The people were also very nice and showed that warm southern hospitality. I am from NYC and currently live in Philadelphia, and believe me when I tell you, that there is badness and problems EVERYWHERE!!!. I am especially interested in Atlanta Georgia because I understand they have wonderful opportunities for Minorities in particular. Is this true? I love suggestions!
