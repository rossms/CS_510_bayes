I bought a Sony DVP-S560D about three months ago, and so far I'm very happy with it. The picture and sound quality are excellent, it's easy to use, and it has lots of great features (like Dolby digital decoding). My one complaint is that sometimes the player itself can be noisy. It doesn't happen all the time, but every now and then while it's playing a movie it will make a high-pitched whirring noise that's loud enough to be distracting.
