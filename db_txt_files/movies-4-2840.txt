This is one of my favorite dreadful pleasures of all-time. It's a gang movie from the 70's. . .kinda like West Side Story for heterosexuals. . .Good fight scenes, funny-as-hell 70's lingo and clothes, impossible plot. Great 70's exploitation film with great gangs and memorable characters. Remember the Riffs? Those guys are some of the all-time underrated bad-asses in cinema. Remember the make-up guys with baseball bats? Warriors. . .come out to plaaaaaay. . . Love it. . .
