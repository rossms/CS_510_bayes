Penn State fan since Bill Higgins was Coach so my opinion might be considered slightly skewed. However the term AMERICAN ICON comes to mind. Good teams, 1st Team AA's, Academic AA's, Post-Grad award winners, 1st Round picks, 75%(?) grad rate(with not one Basket-weaving degree among them), not to mention...no inquiry (not even the hint of one)by the NCAA regarding anything !! Not only a great football coach, but a great leader of men (the kids we send ). Glad I lived in a time that included Color TV, end of the Cold War (saw the beginning) and Jo'Pa !
