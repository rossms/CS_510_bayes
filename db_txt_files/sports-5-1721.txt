I like the Sox and think they've got a good shot at winning again this year. My only question is that last year all of their hitters had career years - what is the likelihood of of that happening again? And will they get the performance they expect from the ageing Schilling? And will Nomar and Manny play with heart and dedication after being potentially traded? To be honest, I have faith that the Red Sox will provide us with nothing less than another heartbreaking season. Besides, if they do win the Series then they lose the curse and some of their aura, so they wouldn't be quite as fun to watch.
