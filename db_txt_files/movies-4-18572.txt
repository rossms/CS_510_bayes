Is this scariest movie of all time? No. Will it still get under your skin? Most definitely. This is more than a movie with scary special effects (Although it contains plenty of those). It makes you seriously consider the possibility of unsettling the dead, of communicating with them. As with other Spielberg films, it explores the innocence of a child, their ability to be open to things which adults are too jaded to see. This movie scared me when I was ten and it still gives me the creeps eighteen years later!
