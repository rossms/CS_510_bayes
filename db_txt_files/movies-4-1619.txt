Yuck. This movie grossed me out so much. There was so much gore and blood (and it looked completely real, too), that I think I almost threw up in the beginning of the movie. Very good plot though, and Kevin Spacey is (like I always say) one of the brightest stars in the sky! He can be picked out immediately in a crowd. I would have given the movie a five it they wouldn't have shown the scene of the obese man at the beginning of the movie. I'd give it a 4.8 if I could, but it was just too gross..
