Bon Jovi is the best rock'n'roll band that exists! This album rocks! It reminds you alittle of Slippery, but more mature. Thank You For Loving Me is the best song on the album. In fact, it was my wedding song! I've had the album since the day it came out and I still listen to it 5 times a week (at least!) It's well worth the money! Buy it! Love it! Rate it 5 stars!
