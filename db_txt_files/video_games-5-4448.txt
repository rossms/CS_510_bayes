Baulder's Gate is a great RPG. Its one of the first to really get into the Race, Class, and Looks of your charactor. Its a long game and you dont have to follow a certian coarse, very few games are like that. You get that warm feeling when you play it, like when your eating your favriote food (thats not a very good comparison but o well). Its a fun and interesting game that all rpg fans should have played along time ago. I would'nt recommend it as a first time rpg or anything because it can get frustrating if you don't know what your doing. Overall, Black Isle did Well.
