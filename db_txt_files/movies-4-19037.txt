An interesting portrayal of a man's psychological breakdown after a divorce, with symbolism that a 10-year-old can decipher (so all the girls watching this movie just for Depp can get the gist of it). The suspense isn't heart stopping, but it does make you a bit uneasy. Most of the suspense pertains to the confusion in the plot, which pieces itself together neatly at the end. The ending isn't really satisfying because it was predictable and a bit disquieting. But other than that, it was a good film with superb acting.
