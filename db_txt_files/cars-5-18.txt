The YFZ 450 is opne of the the best sport quads ever made. I am a strict yamaha and i can also give the honda props. Its a fast quad too, but more trail oriented. Both modded they are equally deadly in the dunes, on the track, or in the woods. Anyone that says they has yet to ride on or is just jealous because they dont have one.
