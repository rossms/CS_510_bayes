sandra bullock's a drunk with bad breath. she should stick to doing commercials for lady speed stick or something. momma always said if you don't have anything nice to say then don't say anything, but i'm sorry, i gotta get this off my chest. i'm sorry momma, i'm cleanin' out my closet. sanda bullock is a five and dime hooker whose acting talent is comprable to my dog's after he crapped on tha floor. come on, dog, don't act like it wasn't you. who do you think crapped on tha floor? it wasn't me. maybe it was sandra bullock.
