i'm not a huge fan of classic quest games because it got all those annoying riddles that force you to combine all kinds of items and i allways got stuck becaus the combinations are often very strange and sometimes seems very irrelevant at the time, but this game maneged to make it tolorable (maybe because it's a lucas arts quest, not sierra's). it got alot of varieted riddles and great gimmics and the preformence is great. i took one point off because it's still a classic type, and i got stuck a few times because of really annoying s**t.
