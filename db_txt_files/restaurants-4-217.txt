I like these guys' chicken sandwiches--by and large, they taste fresher than anything you get elsewhere. Also, the breakfast biscuits are pretty good. I have two gripes here. One, though the fried taste of their chicken is a nice change of pace from KFC et al, it can seem a bit too heavily-fried. And second, for my money, it's a bit overpriced. On balance, though, you could do a lot worse for fast-food chicken.
