ok heres how its going down my boy jwill has a crapy coach. the guy doesnt even play jason for crying out loud. If he did play more then maybe he will score more than whatever hes scoring now. Also im sick and tired of people busting on him and blaming him for the kings losing. just today i went to nba.com and there busting on him saying that he isnt performing, well how the hell are you goin to if you get 19 minutes of time in the playoffs!!!!!! hey rick adalman or whatever your name is go some where else
