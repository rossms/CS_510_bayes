A manipulative hypocrit. Read a good biography of this guy. He underpays and overworks his workforce,denying them the same protection he campaigns to achieve for other workers. He accepts corporate money, refuses to disclose his finances, and abuses non-profit organizations his family has direct control over, but likes to wear the white sheet of purity. I bought into it for awhile, until I had my eyes opened to his vision of righteousness . It's called Get a Good Media Label; the Fools Will Believe It.
