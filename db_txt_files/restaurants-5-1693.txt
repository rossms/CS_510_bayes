Jimmy Johns is far better than Subway. They combine great service with fresh meats and veggies that are bursting with flavor. I also like the meats because they are not processed like Subway. THeir service is great and you get your sandwich almost immeadiately after ordering even though they are not pre made. I would eat here anyday over subway or any other chain. It is delicious and healthy! Look out Subway!!
