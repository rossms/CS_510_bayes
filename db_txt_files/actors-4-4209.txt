pobably my favorite young actor(under40) this guy is muti talented(also sings and dances) like deniro can become a character and disappear into a role. i first saw this guy preform on an episode of e.r. and have been a fan ever since. loved him trainspotting, black hawk down,moulin rouge not to mention the the two star wars prequels. in my opinion has made the role of obi wan kenobi his and i grew up on the orignal. definitely see ewen winning a oscar before he's through. only rivaled by jude law as the best young british actor of his generation.
