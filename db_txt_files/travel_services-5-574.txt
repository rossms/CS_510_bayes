I used to hate using this airport. I would fly from Toledo Express up to here to connect, and it would be a pain in the neck to switch planes. And then the A terminal was built. That was the end of my complaining. About 83 gates, serves every Northwest flight coming in and out, and the place isn't as crowded as the C or D terminals were. This was one airport that went from bad to great in a hurry.
