A powerfully spiritual place; completely awe-inspiring and unique. Beware of falling into the typical imperialists' trap of climbing Uluru as traditional tribes request that their spiritual home be respected and not desecrated further by tourists. It is far more indcredible to walk the 9km perimeter - highly reccommended.
