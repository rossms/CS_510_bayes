I love Boomer. What a great year he is having so far. Just a really likable character as well as a terrific pitcher. I was really sad when the Yankees let him go. Not the best move in my book as far as the way it might have mixed up the great chemistry the team had while Wells was a Yankee. It was so special to see him pitch the perfect game at Yankee Stadium. You know he would not trade that in for anything (except maybe a case of Budweiser).
