As far as animated films go this did an okay job. The animation was extremly well done. But the high-light for me was the cool refrences and visual gags. They were very creative and much more fun than any gag in Shrek 1 or 2. The only thing I didn't like was William's performance. His funniest stuff was on the trailers and aside from that he just wasn't that funny. Overall it's no where near as good as Incredibles or Lion King but it still remains fun.
