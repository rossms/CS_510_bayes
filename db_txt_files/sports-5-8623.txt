well i think kobe is a great player but the greatest player of em all make teamate look better, kobe needs to pass the ball to the true leader of the lakers (shaq), no way he's gonna be like mj till he learn the fundamentals of the game in and out, pass it to the open man, rebound, play solid defense, the scoring thing will come after that, kobe got the skill the break any solid defense in the nba, but he doesn't know how to play as a team, team effort will give ya some rings. so kobe stop looking urself b4 u look ur teamates
