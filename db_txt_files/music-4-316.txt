Great album, don't miss out on it. Breakthrough piece for the band that finally brought them to the forefront of the 'alternative scene' - whatever that is these days. Check out one of the last songs titled 'Sir Psycho Sexy' and get a good reflection as to where the band's roots are and find the soul of the three remaining founders - Chad,Flea and Anthony.
