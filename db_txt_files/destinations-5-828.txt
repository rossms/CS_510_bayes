One of the best countries to live in the whole world and the U.N. agrees with me. Great expanses of pristine wilderness, clean air, low crime rates and a great education system are just some of the reasons this country is great. I could not help but notice that people were more receptive to me overseas afer they found out I was Canadian. Please do not put our flags on your backpacks when traveling if you are from the U.S.A..
