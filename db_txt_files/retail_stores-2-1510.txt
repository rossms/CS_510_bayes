Did not get a good feeling today, shopping at Lord and Taylor in Holyoke, thought sales clerk was quite rude to my mother, who is older and hard of hearing. Seemed to look down on her, when she asked if the 15 percent off was for today--then made my elderly mother go all the way up to the 2nd floor with a broken arm to get a coupon she didnt receive by mail. Then was asked to bring the coupon back upstairs when she was done with it, so I had to bring it back, with two babies in tow. She is a VERY good customer of L % T, tried to discourage her from shopping there in the future.
