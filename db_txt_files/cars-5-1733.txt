I recently had my Festiva totalled by some speeding asshole at traffic lights, so now I'm out to buy a new little machine. I've had a bit of a look around and the Mirages seem to be one of the best ones out there in their price range. And they look great! They're also not too small, yet small enough to be cheap and fuel efficient, so I'm trying to find a good used one now to buy.
