Am waiting to see the nationwide roll-out of Hardee's new menu (by 04/03). While I have heard good things concerning it from patrons who visited the test locations, I do not think Hardee's can pull this off in ALL of their locations and STILL maintain the product quality they assure will be present. I will be amazed if they accomplish same. So will a lot of others, I imagine... ;)
