A great book which is better than the Film (In my opinion anyway), although identical in plot (they were developed by Kubrick / Clark together). The plot involves a mysterious obelisk that is discovered in the outer solar system and the ship crew that is sent to investigate it. On the way the ships computer starts to malfunction. This is the best part of the book with HAL's descent into madness and then reduction to child like status particularly effective.
