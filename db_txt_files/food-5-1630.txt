A great hard candy (especially the pineapple ones) and I for one actually like the new flavors, I find the blackberry life savers really good. The flavours all have distinctive tastes and not overly fake as in other candies such as starburst. The only kind I don't like are the cream savers but I know most ppl do so I must be the one out of the loop on this, I'm not a fan of the green lime ones either.
