I have to say that Old Navy is one of my favorite stores, but not all of the clothing there is that great. I have gotten some adorable clothes from there for a great price, but they aren't tough clothes; my tech vest lost the 'Old Navy' on the zipper tag the first time through the wash. I do love their jeans though; I just got several pairs before I started college and they are so comfortable for those days where I just want to huddle inside a sweatshirt. The jeans are holding up pretty well so far. I'm definitely getting some more when I got back. They go with everything and look fabulous.
