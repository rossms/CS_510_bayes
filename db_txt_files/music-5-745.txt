A double album. The first disc, a studio offering, is both electronic and lush, experimental yet engaging. Definently one of the Tori Amos albums with the broadest appeal. Songs like 'Bliss' and 'Riot Poof' are full of energy, while 'Suede' and 'Spring Haze' are enigmatic and mysterious in their gorgeosity. The accompanying live album is a bit hit and miss at times and does not convey the amazingness that is a Tori Amos live experience - but that doesn't stop it from having a lot of wonderful performances. In particular, 'Precious Things,' 'Sugar,' 'Bells for Her,' and 'Purple People' stand out for me.
