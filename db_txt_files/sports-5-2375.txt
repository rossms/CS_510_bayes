This is a good team on paper. They have a talented lineup and one of the best young pitching staffs in the league. They had a good road record last year but a sorry home record. If they continue to struggle at home, Manager Bruce Bochy better shave that big mustache of his and demand ownership to return to Qualcomm Stadium.
