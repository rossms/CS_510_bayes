I have to agree with some of the other reviewers about this one. The holes in the plot knocked this one down a star. If Bruce Willis' spirit remained on Earth with his former wife then you'd think that he'd have been there when his body was taken and buried. But other than that the movie was enjoyable. The actors weren't cheesy or trying too hard to scare you like most horror films.
