I'll admit there's a lot of bad stuff about Cali (ie, crime, cost of living, etc...). But with that, there are so many great things to do and see. In fact, I have lived there for about 20 years and there's still so much I want to do. In my opinion, this far outweighs all the bad. It is easily the best state in the US I have seen.
