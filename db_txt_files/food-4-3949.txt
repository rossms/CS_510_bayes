I've always liked ruffles. Even though they are made by frito-lay, they are thicker than lays and so hold on much better in dip. Also, the plain variety tastes much better, crispier and way less greasy, than regular lays. Lays however, does win over ruffles for the ketchup flavored chips but ruffles holds their own with cheddar and sour cream
