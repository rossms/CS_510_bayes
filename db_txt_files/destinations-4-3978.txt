Disney's heaven to any kid. Outside of that Orlando's a fairly exciting place, very cool club scene, great weather aside from summertime. I taught baseball down there one summer and my ears were so blistered up that they actually bled. I had to wear black protective shields over my ears and the kids started calling me mickey mouse.
