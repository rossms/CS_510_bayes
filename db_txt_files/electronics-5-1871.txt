It is awesome and I hate those dumn asses that hate it just because of what it looks like. they probably dont even have one. Best graphics. Also when it came out dvds were already out and why would u just get another if u already have one. if u dont, 30$ for a dvd player is pretty cheap and with a remote too. also Halo rules!!!!!!!!!
