Blaqpower WHY are you so angry? Babe Ruth played in a long gone by era and YES you idiot he was one of the best in his day. Comparing him to later players in later times is like saying typewriters are less helpful in the office than a personal computer - Well, NO DUH! But in their day they sure beat writing everything by hand. Get a grip on your biggotry and experience reality why don't you.
