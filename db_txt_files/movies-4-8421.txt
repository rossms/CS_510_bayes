I should warn you immediately that the sequel is much -- much -- raunchier than the original. Don't bring the kids along. I liked Dustin Hoffman's character, and while I'm not a huge fan of Streisand, I thought she did a well-enough job. It seemed sometimes the audience was laughing because they wanted to find it funny rather than because it actually was.
