A great, smooth tasting coffee that I enjoy almost every morning nowadays. Usually you can get FOLGERS on sale, which is always a great thing as coffee is getting so expensive. I absolutely love the smell of Folgers, too. It is the perfect smell to wake up to in the morning. I also love the new Folger's containers with the handle thing, those are awesome, no more coffee spills !
