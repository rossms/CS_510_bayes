Most of the Burger King's I've been to have VERY rude people working there. For example, the Burger King by the Sun Valley Mall on Contra Costa Blvd. has horrible customer service. I know they're not happy to be there but it's not my fault. The guy needed change and he was waiting for it but he didn't tell me so I asked and he was very snappy with me. Never going there again.
