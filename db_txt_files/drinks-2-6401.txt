Diet Coke is pretty close to the bottom of the barrel when it comes to diet sodas. Although this doesn't taste so bad when you get used to it, it is quite bland and does have quite an aftertaste. There are better diet sodas out there than Diet Coke. I'd recommend Diet Vanilla Coke, Diet Dr. Pepper, Diet Mountain Dew Code Red (but not regular Diet Mountain Dew), and Fresca if you want a good-tasting diet soda, and even Diet Pepsi tastes better than this. Diet Coke is not the way to go.
