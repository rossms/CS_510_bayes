I first saw this in a film class in college and as far as that went it was interesting (camera angles, movement, symbolism blah blah blah) it was a turning point in filmaking history. And I did find the story pretty interesting and the acting was great. The whole Rosebud thing pretty much annoyed be. But all in all, a good movie.
