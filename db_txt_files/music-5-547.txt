Great collection of songs from the most popular band of the eighties. The Limited Edition 2CD set gives an added bonus of some great B-Sides that were hard to come by before this. You can hear Bono's vocals and Edge's guitar mature from the older tracks like I Will Follow to later tracks like Where The Streets Have No Name. A must have for anyone that appreciates U2 or just likes Best Of or Greatest Hits compilations.
