I like the benches and chairs. Good place to browse. Salespeople are friendly and helpful and will take time to help you order/find a particular book. There are always sales tables. Good selection of magazines. Better selection of books than Barnes Noble and other physical bookstores I've visited. New books on display when one first walks in.
