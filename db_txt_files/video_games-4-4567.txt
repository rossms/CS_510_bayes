 This game deserves 4 stars. You are a dictator of a small Island. As a dictator, you must provide jobs, please the factions, and maintain a decent relationship with US Russia. If you don't accomplish your goals, the military and rebels will attack your palace. Next to Sims, this is my favorite CD-rom.
