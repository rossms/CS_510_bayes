LOVE THIS GAME! Since playing it with my family as a kid (the non deluxe blue cup and small white dice and playing on the table) to my now Deluxe version with luxurious black pleather cup and little felt lined rolling table and sparkly gold dice! My husband and I went on a compulsive obsessive Yahtzee binge a while back. 4 Yahtzees in one game is my record. Also a great way to teach kids how to add.
