I know women seem to uniformly love Sex and the City but I, as a man, was never able to sit through it for more than 10 minutes. Not only did it impress me as being supremely superficial (do I really care about the love woes and man troubles of narcissistic yuppies?) but it was dull to boot. And also, I don't mean to appear superficial myself, but I can't imagine a man getting worked up about any of these women, much less Sarah Jessica.
