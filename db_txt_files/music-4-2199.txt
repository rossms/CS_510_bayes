I think I would have to disagree with Wiggum. I think that Songs from an America Movie is a far better CD than So Much for the Afterglow. This CD tells a cohesive story - while Afterglow has 3-4 outstanding tracks, a couple decent ones and a few horrible metal-ish bombs, the tracks from American Movie blend in to one another. I have never not listened to this CD from the first track to the last - it hangs together so well. Maybe a little too poppy to stand the test of time, but Songs From an American Movie is an album that I will definitely enjoy for a while.
