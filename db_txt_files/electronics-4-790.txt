The Nokias are good in size, but with better technology, these phones should weight less like the Motorola cell phones. As fairest features, it has everything, voice mail, e-mail, etc. But remember that in the long run the plan (minutes, weekend rates, long distance) you signed on will make the difference on how useful your cell phone will be (that's if you are trying to save money).
