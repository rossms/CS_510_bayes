As much as I like Costa Rica, San Jose is an absolute dump. I lived here for a couple of months, and while the people are very very nice, and the culture is cool - I would escape for either coast every chance I got. Best thing about San Jose is that you can get on a bus for a couple of bucks to anywhere in this magnificent country.
