The world's second greatest country after America. Such a rich history and culture and so many legends (they say they have about 7 ghosts per square mile), not to mention that many of the best musicians came from there. And their food actually isn't that bad. Toad in the hole and Cumberland sausage never fail to please. And unlike the French, they recognize their failings and prestige with good humor and modesty.
