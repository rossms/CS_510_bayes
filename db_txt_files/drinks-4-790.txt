Xingu is a lager, which means it is bottom fermented. They call it a black beer, or black lager. But it looks like a stout, and definitely finishes like one. As I get older, my beer is starting to get darker. If you are the adventuresome type, you should give this one a try. The problem is its price. I can find it for $8.29 a 6-pack at my local Beverages 'n' More, which is STIFF! But, it is well worth the price. You should find this one more maltier than hoppy. The lactose does emerge on the palate than the hops.
