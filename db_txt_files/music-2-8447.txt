Sooo... honestly, the only major scene of part I can recall from watching the video is the part where the boys are in a snow field and Nick (the blond one, right?) is singing with a serious (too serious) face. I laughed so hard you know. I mean, how original can you get? If you get the chance, watch it. You'll laugh too.
