Maravich was the most prolific scorer and ball handler in the history of college basketball and the greatest showman in the history of all levels. Who cares if the guy never won. He needed a supporting cast. This guy should definitely be ranked above Bird. The guy who gave him 3 stars is high as a kite and obviously has never watched or played basketball in his life!
