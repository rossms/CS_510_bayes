Roy Williams was asked recently what Jackie needs to work on, and he said,nothing. Jackie is awesome defensively, hustles, works hard in practice, and based on his 7-10 shooting the other night, he has drastically improved offensively - not that we needed him to. Jackie deserves a memorable senior year.
