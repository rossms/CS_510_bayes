Cry me a frickin river over steeped tea. For God's sake, its like 30 cents....are you going to die?! All you complainers should simply make your own steeped tea...such an easy way to save money and save stress over complaining about the high cost of steeped tea at your local tim hortons. Im sure they have bagged tea lying around somewhere! Ahhhhhhhhhhh
