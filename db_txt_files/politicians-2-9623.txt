The only positive comment I can make about Carter is that he was better than Clinton, at least on the character issue. He had no vision and was an apologist for America. His malaise speech was the metaphor for his entire administration. He had no idea how to confront the problems of inflation and the stagnating economy -- although he did appoint Paul Volcker as Fed Chairman and that was a positive. Carter's ineffectual leadership during the Iran crisis was the final insult. A very bad -- perhaps even terrible -- president.
