I have to admit...i didn't want to go see this movie. My wife bugged me til I gave in and took her to it. It turned out to be a really cute movie. It's one of the best romantic comedies I've seen in awhile. Reese Witherspoon and Mark Ruffalo are a great onscreen pair. I would wholly recommend watching this movie.
