People either love them or hate them. I LOVE them! They are odd and the color scheme interesting...and the name leaves something to be desired...but I can eat a whole box in 15 minutes! =) I think reaction to Good n Plenty candy is linked somehow to one's personality. Everyone I think is cool shares my affinity towards the candy. I only surround myself with fellow G n P lovers!
