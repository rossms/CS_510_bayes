Mac OS X.2 For everyday computer use, this OS is outstanding. It is the most stable operating system I have ever used. Is is so far beyond any windows system ... imagine an operating system that never crashes! (The only things that have ever crashed on my computer are Microsoft products, and even then just the app crashes, not the whole system.)
