The service is horrid. The people are snotty,especially when you ask what is similar to a drink from a different retailer. The only thing going for this company is the ambiance, which by the way, does not justify me spending $5 on a cup of coffee that I am walking out the door with anyhow. It's no wonder they are the 2nd top retailer and not the first.-
