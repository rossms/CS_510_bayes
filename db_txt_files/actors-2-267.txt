A total ham. OK in It Happened One Night, but he had a good script, capable female lead to work with and a fine director to keep him in it. Also did a fine job in The Misfits, his swan song, be he was also very well supported in that one. The man was born to play Rhett Butler, a role that fit him like a glove. However, you look at many of his other roles and the result is lacking: too much of the time he's just blustering and going through the paces, or merely doing his Clark Cable imitation.
