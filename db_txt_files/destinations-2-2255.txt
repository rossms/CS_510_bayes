Think of this as a 2 1/2, please. Why do you insist on blaming the entire country for the acts of a few wealthy men?! Not the ideal place to live...the treatment of women there is just inhuman. But if they would just work for a better government that treats women like humans and not animals and did not fly around terrorizing whatever country they are terrorizing at the particular time, as well as one that is actually capable of running a country, Afghanistan might be an interesting place to visit. Right NOW I dont' particularly wish to go there, but maybe someday after the war is over...take care, everyone!
