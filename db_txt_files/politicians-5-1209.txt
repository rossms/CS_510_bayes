Arafat is a unique man. Although losing most battles he remains the undisputed leader of the palestinians in their struggle to become liberated and free from the ruthless jewish military occupation. His efforts to raise awareness of the plight of palestinian refugees for more than 50 yrs is applaudable. The world now realizes the suffering of millions of Palestinians caused by Israel's refusal to allow refugee's safe passage to their homes (as required by int'l law and human rights conventions)
