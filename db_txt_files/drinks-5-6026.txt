I was born in Ohio in 1984 and moved to Kentucky in 1998. We always made trips to Kentucky to see family and we always bought what seemed like gallons worth of Ale-8 before we went back to Ohio. What did we do with all of it? We stockpiled it! Now I live here and Ale-8 is sold in Ohio, as well as many parts of the eastern United States thanks to Coca-Cola. Ale-8 is definately a Kentucky tradition that the whole world deserves to experience.
