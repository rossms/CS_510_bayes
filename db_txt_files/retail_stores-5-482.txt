What can you say about the Gap? It's not the most exciting store in the world, but it sets the standard for basic, not-cheap but not-expensive casual clothes. If you want a pair of simple khakis or jeans, the Gap makes it really easy - even more so if you shop on-line at Gap.com. My biggest complaint about the Gap is that they planted one of their ubiquitous stores on the corner of Haight Ashbury in San Francisco - the center of the anti-establishment, summer of love, hippie counter-culture in the late 60s and early 70s. Were they intentionally trying to be ironic?
