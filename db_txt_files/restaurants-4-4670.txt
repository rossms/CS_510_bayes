Actually they got rid of the goofy hats and outfits a few years ago. Now the servers wear black shirts and blue jeans. The menu has a fairly broad appeal and the crowd is generally college-age. Friday's also makes great drinks but they are on the pricy side. All in all it is a fun and casual restaurant.
