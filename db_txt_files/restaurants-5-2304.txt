Another high-quality QSR (quick-service restaurant) , one I didn't know was unique to the Southeast. Their Krystal Chiks are great and cheap. Their french fries are also very well made and taste great. Their other foods are great if you like small foods or want something cheap or in bulk. Service is typically quick as well.
