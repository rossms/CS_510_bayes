Excellent coach in the likeness of Marty Schotenheimer. Fisher is a terrific defensive minded coach. Although he is heading into a season with alot of his favorite faces gone, he can and probably will manage to lead his team very well. The Titans probably won't have the talent to go far this year, but the building blocks for future seasons are already being built.
