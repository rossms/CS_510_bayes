I personally hate Miller, but I can't give him anything less than a 5. The fact of the matter is that he's an awesome. The waning seconds of the game have been traditionally referred to as Miller Time. I would love to see him on the Knicks. Reggie obviously steps it up in the clutch. He is the most proficient player in the history of basketball from my favorite part of the floor, 3-point range. He finds ridiculous ways to draw fouls and uses screens from his teammates extremely effectively. Finally, he is a lights-out shooter from the foul line, perennially shooting over 90%.
