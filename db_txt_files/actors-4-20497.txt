A very good actress with looks to spare. Although she lowered herself to Mike Myers' standards for Wayne's World, she has shown her acting abilities in many other movies, such as "Showdown in Little Tokyo" and "True Lies". She has numerous indie and B-movie credits and her TV show Relic Hunter. Emmy talent, but Razzie writing on Relic.
