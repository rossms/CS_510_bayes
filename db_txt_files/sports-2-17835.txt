The Ravens are always a hard team to gauge. With only one big star in the secondary, a no name defensive line, and no clear experienced quarterback, they may be in trouble. The bright spot of course is Ray Lewis and Peter Boulware. These guys have big play potential every snap, so as long as it's a close game, never count these guys out.
