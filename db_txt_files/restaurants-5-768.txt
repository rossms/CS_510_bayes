If you want to find a wide variety of great ice cream of other treats, Dairy Queen is the place to visit. Not only do they sell ice cream, but burgers, chicken sandwiches, and best of all the foot long chili dog. DQ sure does treat everybody right, which was part of their long time slogan We Treat You Right .
