the reason i rated it great was because as far as taste it is 5 stars of nasty.. if these were the only cigarettes in the world, i would have to quit. i will roll my own or buy silvers (generic brand found in most tobacco stores) these (silvers) only cost 1.84 tax included and taste exactly as a marlboro and the menthols taste just like a newport. other than that i wouldn't give a basic to my worst enemy! i know why the name is basic because it is basically crap.
