The L certainly has charm, is affordable, fast, and extends across most of the city (including to both airports, a terrific thing) - but it does have some problems, particularly that there are parts of the city that are completely bypassed by the L train. There are CTA buses that fill in those gaps, but those buses are uneven in their timing, and there are far more buses on the ritzy side of town than the more gritty sides. Still, overall, it's a very good and well put together public transportation system.
