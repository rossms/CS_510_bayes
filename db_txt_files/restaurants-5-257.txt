They don't have them on the East Coast. If they ever do, I would love to have a franchise. My family ate at the one in San Diego Mission Valley while on vacation. The burgers are plump, savory, and freshly made to order, not the frozen Nairobi trail markers offered by Burger King, Mickey-Ds, et. al. In-N-Out has good fries and shakes as well. My wife stated that In-N-Out Burger was a cut above the rest. What also stands out was the cleanliness of the joint. Even the teenaged dudes working there seemed like clean-cut lads.
