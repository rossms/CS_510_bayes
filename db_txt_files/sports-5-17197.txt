This teams getting there. With Eddie George at RB and Keyshawn and Glenn at Reciever, as well as a solid vet in Testaverde at QB, the Cowboys have a tremendous upside. Throw in a Coach like Parcells and the future is very bright. In a yeear or two they could be serious heavyweights. Expect them to take the wild card this year.
