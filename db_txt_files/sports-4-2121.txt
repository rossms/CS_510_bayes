I would expect the Twins to play as well as last year mainly because they are a youthful team and really did not lose much of their talent in the offseason. While Minnesota does seem to lack power, they have their share of .290 and .300 hitters, their pitching is steady, and their fielding may be the best in MLB. A good model for success
