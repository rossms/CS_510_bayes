A very beautiful state around late September and early October, when the trees are filled with blood-red leaves. Right outside Green Bay, on I-45, there is a massive army of these red-colored trees and it is a spectacular sight. A little cold, but the summers are beautiful-- a crisp temperature with a warm sun around noon time.
