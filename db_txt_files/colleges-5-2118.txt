Davidson College is an excellent institution of higher learning. It is extremely competitive academically. The student body is way above average intellectuality and socially. Davidson is refreshingly strong in academic stimulation and does not fall trap to the ridiculous anti-intellectual social re-engineering so popular on many college campuses today.
