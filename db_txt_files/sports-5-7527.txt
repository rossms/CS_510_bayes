Two for McAdoo!!! Unstoppable scorer, quality rebounder and underated defender. Far too many people only remember him as a reserve on a stacked Laker team. One of the very few players to lead the league in scoring three years in a row, and the last player for a 25 yr span (until Shaq) to lead the league in scoring AND Field Goal Percentage. Won a high school state high jump contest against Bobby Jones in sneakers and cutoffs, vs. Bobby's spikes and track shorts. Magic's mentor in regards to black awareness and giving back to the community.
