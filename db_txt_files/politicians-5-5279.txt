I feel that people need to stop trying to use excuses to downgrade Mr. Gore and take a personal look at their own life. I feel that this is only an excuse for not voting for him. I guess there are more people than what I thought that can't remember that before Bill Clinton and Al Gore went into office we were in recession and the deficit was horrible.
