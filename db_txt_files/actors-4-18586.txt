A really good Director- who made films of social significance in the 50s and 60s. On the Beach (1959) was excellent, but somewhat melancholy- and his 'Guess Who's Coming To Dinner (1967) was funny and pushed the limits social change in that frenzied decade. 'Judgement at Nuremburg' is another fine film exploring social discourse on the horrors of Nazi Germany in the post war.
