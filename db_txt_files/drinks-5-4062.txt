I must say that if any drink out there proves your a man, this is it! Well not really, I know of worse rums, but this is the worst/best stuff I've ever had! The first experience with it I had like 3 shots and some Jello shots after that and I felt great! The absolutely best feeling, until I woke up. When I got home around 6 am, I could not stop throwing up! I seriously was throwing-up just thinking about it! I like it but I won't drink it again for a while. It still makes me weazy!
