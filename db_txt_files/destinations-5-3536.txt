What a beautiful city. By far one of the cleanest downtowns I've ever been in. Bustling downtown with great shopping from Nordstrom, Saks and Mier and Frank. Love the light rail. Beautiful parks, great neighborhoods and plenty of great restaurants too. Absolutely beautiful natural setting. Great art galleries and bookstores and a pretty safe big city. I think Portland is one of America's best kept secrets. I highly recommend this beautiful city for a nice visit or to live.
