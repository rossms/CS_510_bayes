Of the 3 Indiana Jones movies, this is not the greatest. However, Harrison Ford makes Indiana Jones come alive on screen, immensing you in the action and plot. Overall, a great movie, however there are some parts of the plot where I lost interest. Good acting and excitement definitely make this one worth watching however.
