I love this guy. Juan Pierre personnifies the Florida Marlins. He is young, cocky, fast, and scrappy. With 200+ hits, lots of walks, and blazing speed, he is the perfect lead off man. Also, he seems to be an amazing clubhouse guy. Every time the camera pans across the Marlins' dugout, you can see Pierre - laughing, joking with his teammates, and getting them fired up. Pierre is a huge reason the Marlins blew by the bickering Phils to win the wild card, and looks to be having an impact on the Giants series as well.
