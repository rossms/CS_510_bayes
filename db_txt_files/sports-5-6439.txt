Not too many people picked the Jayhawks to do much in the tournament this year (2001), but there they are in the Sweet 16, as usual. Regardless of how far they end up going, you have to give KU five stars. Roy Williams is one of the top five college basketball coaches in the country, and under his leadership the program is consistently a national power. On top of that, Williams runs the program with integrity and class. I ll be rooting for the Jayhawks to knock off Illinois on Friday.
