This is a real sleeper movie, and had me laughing out loud throughout. My favorite scene: a hung-over Shaun wanders out of his house to go to the store. Still unaware that zombies are overrunning his neighborhood, he brushes off the approaches of the undead, saying "sorry man, i don't have any change." As someone who is approached by zombies (usually of the crack variety) every single time I step out of my apartment, I could relate to Shaun's confusion.
