XS Energy drink is hands down the best energy drink on the market. However, the only downfall is that you must get it from a franchise owner of Quixtar. That company simply brainwashes people. It would be wonderful if XS would eventually become available in stores. It's rare that a pyramid company actually has a superior product... Quixtar certainly did it this time.
