i'm a Clemson Tiger, not an Auburn homer, but Bo was the best college athlete to ever step on the field....the only difference between Bo and Herschel is Bo was faster...Bo also made the best throw I've ever seen in baseball, throwing out Harold Reynolds on the fly from left center...a truly amazing athlete.
