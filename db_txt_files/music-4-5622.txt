A good album but some people are mistaken to think it's cutting edge. Just go and listen to early Aerosmith. Still, there are some classic cuts like 'Welcome..', 'Sweet child..' and the best hard rock tune of the 80's 'Paradise city'. There are also a couple of tracks that they could've dropped which would've made it a 5 star job.
