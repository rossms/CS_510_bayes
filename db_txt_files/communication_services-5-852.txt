I have tried more than one mobile phone company. Sprint seems to offer the best rates, service nad no contracts. You have the option to change your monthly minutes at any time as often as you wish. The coverage area is very good. I recently traveld out of state on a family emergency and did not have time to do anything. But when I arrived at my destination, I was able to turn on my phone and make calls as usual. No extra costs, no changes to my service! It was a relief. Sprintalso has the nicest folks in thier customer service dept. Thanks Sprint, for making my life easier.
