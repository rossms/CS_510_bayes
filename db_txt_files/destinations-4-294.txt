Couldn't live anywhere else in NZ. Plenty of interesting places to visit in town, pretty views of the harbour/s, out west there are the Waitakere Ranges covered in native bush and surf beaches when you get out to the coast. Further north there's countryside and wineries towards Kumeu, and there are nice beaches around Orewa and the North Shore. Largest city in New Zealand, abounding in friendly jafas (a rude national joke. The rest of the country's just jealous ^__^).
