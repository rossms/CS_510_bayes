I read this about a year ago and it was a pretty good book. A young girl ends up in the foster care system after her mother ends up in jail.She ended up going from one foster care to another. I felt bad for AStrid the girl. I was glad she finally had a happy life at the end of the story. I felt one sad thought about this book is that not all foster homes are good. and poor Astrid ended up in some of them.
