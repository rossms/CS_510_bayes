finlay has a lot of unique pieces to offer a jewelry collector. the quality isn't always the highest so that everyone can enjoy the pieces. however, you can find designer pieces at reasonable prices. as for the sales, it's retail people! who isn't on sale these days. these are hard times. oh, and i have never gone without getting my full hours worth of break time.
