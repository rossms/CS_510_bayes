I currently work at a Cold Stone, and I love it. We have many different ice creams for different people. We have sorbet which is dairy free, yogurt(in some places), and also our Sinless Sweet Cream, which only has sugar-added. (We use Splenda, sorbitol, and lactitol in it though). I've been coming to Cold Stone for over a decade, and still find it fun and exciting everytime. It's true, Cold Stone is not the healthiest of ice creams, but you don't eat ice cream for how healthy it is, do you?
