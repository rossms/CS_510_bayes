I've had one for 6 months now. It is a V6, and burns the same gas as the other 2 V-6's I've owned. The 3rd row seat fits my 4 kids great. You won't fit big teenagers back there, so stay away if that's what your looking for. For a family with small kids, it's a great option other than a mini van. It has 4WD, and for the price, you won't find another car 3rd row seating. I love this car.
