I finished the book for school last night. It was better than I thought, but I still don't get the point of it. What was the major thing happening in the story? Boo Radley, Tom Robinson, or Dill? I didn't like the character Dill- the book makes it sound like something major happens with Dill involved. Dill was unnecessary in the story.
