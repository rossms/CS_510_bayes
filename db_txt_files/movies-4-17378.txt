Good movie. A young girl is born into a Maori tribe that was next in line for chief. Her twin brother dies at birth he would have been the chief. The girl Pai tries hard to win her grandfathers approval but he thinks less of her since she is a girl.Pai can do everything a boy can do sometimes even better. It is heartbreaking at times to see this girl so desparately try to win her grandfathers approval. Finally in the end she proves her bravery involving whales. It is nice to see a movie where a little girl gets to be the hero. very nicely done movie and well acted by newcomer Keisha Castle- Hughes.
