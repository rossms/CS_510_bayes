Ok so all these comments on here are old for the exception of the one on 11/18/2005 even though its somewhat old. Now the Hawks are 13-3. They are the second best team in the league with a record breaking running back. A top 5 rated quarterback and a defense that allows few points. This has been a great year for this team. They barely drop the ball anymore and Holmgren has finally brought the team together and everything is clicking. They will be a tough team to stop in the playoffs. We will find out this Saturday weather or not this team is for real.
