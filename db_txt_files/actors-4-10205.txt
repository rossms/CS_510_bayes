Julianne Moore is becoming one of my favorite actresses. She has an unbelievable range! From the maternal role model, porn star in Boogie Nights to the lighthearted comedy with Hugh Grant to her wild and believable role as the neurotic, unstable yet loving wife in Magnolia. I have enjoyed her performances in many Independent films as well and look forward to future films. I would actually go see a movie simply for the fact that she was in it.
