I'm not surprised Solaris was a commercial bomb. It's a bit too smart for the cineplex crowd, and probably not quite smart enough for the arthouse crowd. For me, I like arthouse films and some dumb Hollywood stuff, so I found Solaris to be a decent watch. It's not as good or as deep as Tarkovsky's original, but it's refreshing, in these ADD times, to see any big name Hollywood film with the cajones to be slow. Not for stupidos.
