The best team ever. Just got back from a Yankee game in fact. Anyone who says the Yankees stink are just jealous. I was raised to be a Yankee fan, from my father. I am not a bandwagoner like so many others. I am a lifer, and will be a lifer, even through another 18 year dry spell. At least it's not the Red Sox 85 year spell. HA! HA! Red Sox suck! Go Yanks! First place, now and forever!!!
