Yes, you really must see Tokyo. It is the world's most modern city, clean and friendly -- and crowded. Be sure to take the train loop that goes over the harbor and the Yamanote line around the city. See ultra-chic in Shinjuku, nerds and gadgets in Akihabara. Plan ahead and you can save money by not staying the city center. Public transit will take you there quickly. Try for spring or fall.
