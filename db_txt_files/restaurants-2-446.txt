I cannot believe Wendy's is the second highest rated restaurant right now. They have my most hated fries. They're really not browned enough and taste undercooked. I went the other day (another member of my family wanted to go) and I nearly needed industrial tools to even cut my chicken sandwich. Bad, but I guess it all depends on who is cooking. Probably every restaurant is different. That's why I'm giving it a 2.
