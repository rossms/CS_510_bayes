Has been playing since the beginning of time, and is somewhat overrated. Stole a load of bases, got walked a lot, which was everything a leadoff hitter needs to do. However, he is not the greatest leadoff hitter. Ty Cobb or Pete Rose would get my vote. Isn't it weird how all great leadoff hitters are jerks?
