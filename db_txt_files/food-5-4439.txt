Cheddar is such a great cheese, so versatile. It's a staple of Mexican American cuisine. Perhaps I'm being a bit too serious about a cheese, but without cheddar many of my own simple creations of desperation, which usually consist of different forms of meat, rice, and cheddar cheese. Cheddar makes everything better =)
