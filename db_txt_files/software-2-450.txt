seeing it crash and almost crap itself again made me lower the rating!!!!! on games it tends to crash sometimes especally on complex games with modifications (addons for additonal game codes, maps, etc.) and we seem to not be able to get Windos Movie Maker to work right but we are getting it to work better overtime. get linux instead... or win 2000
