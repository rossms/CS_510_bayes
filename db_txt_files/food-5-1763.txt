These are a product of a little chocolate company in Lititz, PA called Wilbur Chocolate Company. Wilbur Buds are very similar to Hershey's Kisses (size, shape), but are 1000x better tasting! Buds come in a milk chocolate or a dark chocolate variety. I absolutely love them! I used to live in Lititz, so they were a standard candy for me. Now that I'm in Delaware, I don't have them as often, but when I visit my old hometown, I make it a point to visit the Wilbur Store and grab a bag of the dark ones (my favorites), but the milk chocolate ones are good, too.
