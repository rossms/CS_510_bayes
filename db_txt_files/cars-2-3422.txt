I've been shopping for a mini suv for the wife for a few months. The Rav4 struck my fancy as cool styling and ergonimcally pleasing, but after giving it a test drive and checking out the specs, I'm going to pass. Underpowered and WAY too overpriced for this little thing. It's bacisally a cool looking KIA Sportage. I'm going with the V-6 Ford Escape or Jeep Liberty...
