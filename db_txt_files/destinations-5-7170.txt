I used to live here and guide tourists from Punta Sabbione by vaparetto down the Grand Canal and to the Rialto Bridge. I lost count of the gasps I heard at the sights to behold as we passed the Basilica....Venice as a city has no equal anywhere else. The smell is only noticeable really during the hot summer months and is caused by the growth of algae in the marshlands of this part of the Adriatic Coast.
