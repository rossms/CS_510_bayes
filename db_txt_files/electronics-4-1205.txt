Im not a huge fan of the circular touch pad nor the fact that my battery dies after 4 hours of use but I wouldn't be able to get through my workouts without it. The storage capacity is great and my fiancee tells me the songs are easy to download on to it... though I've not attempted to do it (too high tech for me...LOL).
