yes when considering james cameron you must dig further than 4 years into your memory. when it comes to his speciality, he's always had an almost impeccable sense of pacing and progression. and most of his movies do reach a certain level of intelligence, as far as action movies go. entertainment is his art, and he's good at it. but i do agree with thorne - i still find titanic watchable for it's sets, props, effects, cinematography and overall grandure.
