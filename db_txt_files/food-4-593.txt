Shroomwoman- I hear you- that's why I only eat Rice Krispies with a whole, sliced-up banana in it. A tasty combination that adds substance to the plain Rice Krispies. I also agree with the others who noted how soggy this cereal can get. The best thing is to pour the cereal, then only at the last minute slice on a banana and pour milk on and feast immediately! Yummy and nutritious. Kids seem to like it this way too.
