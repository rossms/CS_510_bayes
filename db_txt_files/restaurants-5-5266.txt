I have never considered Fazoli's a sit down resturant. It is, in my opinion, a fast food place. As far as fast food places goes, this place is among the best. The prices tend to be a bit higher than in other fast food joints, but it is worth it. Maybe not as good as you can find in a more traditional Italian resturant, but fr better than in most fast food joints. When you are sick of the old Burger and Fries routine for lunch, or a quick supper, Fazoli's is a nice alternative.
