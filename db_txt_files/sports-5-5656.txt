Garcia can do it all - great shooter, handles the ball well, excellent passer, etc. He often carried the team on his shoulders during his sophomore year. Francisco completely won me over when he played two games during the week of his brother's tragic murder. They were, understandably, very emotional games for him, but he was able to come through for the team. He is a good person, both on and off the court. I wish him good luck in his pursuit of a career in the NBA. (Love that accent.)
