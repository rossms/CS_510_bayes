I have the opportunity every Buccaneers home game to watch the A- Train in person at Raymond James Stadium. When this guy has the ball , puts a hurtin on defenders. His two biggest assets are his leg strength and his deceptive speed. Every yard he gets, he deserves. It always takes 6 or 7 guys to bring him down. For a big man, he can run.Throught his career he has broken long gains where he has outran defensive backs to the endzone. This guy is all desire and heart, he gives his all on every play. He is a fan favorite on and off the field in the Tampa Bay area.
