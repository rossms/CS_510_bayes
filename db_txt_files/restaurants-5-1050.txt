Why are these guys losing so much money? I have never met anyone who doesn't like the food here, the restaurants always seem to busy, and the marketing campaign seems decent. Is the management just clueless on the business side? Are they charging less than the food costs them? Can a couple of MBA's do some charity work and help these guys out?
