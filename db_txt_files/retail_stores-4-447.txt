I love the Gap. A lot of my clothes are from the there. The only thing I will not buy from there are the jeans because the two pairs I have seemed to have expaned two or three sizes after just a few washings. Can uaually find good deals, and not everyone shops there so you are not wearing the same thing as 50 other people.
