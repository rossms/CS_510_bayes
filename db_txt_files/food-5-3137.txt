This is the best line of vegetarian meals in the WORLD. I am a big fan of the enchiladas, stirfrys, canned chili, veggie bowls, tofu scramble & rancheros, pizzas, and wraps. I can't stand the pot pies, though, because the crust tastes like cardboard. But all in all, I LOVE the Amy's products and even my non-vegetarian friends think they're absolutely deelish!
