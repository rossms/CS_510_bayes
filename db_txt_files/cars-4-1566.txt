I won't say my Grand Am has never had a problem, but overall it has been reliable. I had a problem with my gas gauge last year, and my electric locks keep going on the blink. Apparently it's last owners never maintained it (I bought it used...'97 with 30,000 miles on it). Now it's at 63,000, I just paid it off, and it's running well. Buy an extended warranty with this car, if you get it used. I did and it's saved me a lot of money.
