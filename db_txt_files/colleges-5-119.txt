This school allowed me to go international and see the world. Actually, one year MBA was one of the most challenging experience I have ever experienced. Small classes and still maintain contacts with my fellow classmates. I went to one of the better Big Ten schools as an undergrad and Katz was a much better experience in terms of interaction with other students.
