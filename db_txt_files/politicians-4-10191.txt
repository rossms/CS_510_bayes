I think he proved himself after 9-11! His tax cuts help push us out of Clinton's inherited recesion. He is a strong leader, who we need now more then EVER with world terror on the rise. We need a president who won't back down from terrorists and will help protect America even if doesn't get U.N.'s approval. Every president makes his mistakes but overall I don't think anyone could handle the job better. It scares me to think how a democrat would handle the National Defense issues.
