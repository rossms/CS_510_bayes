Blushingly I sheepishly admit that I liked this goofy flick. The characters are all likeable and that makes it work. I loved how the conflict with the Klopeks built up. That scene where the two garbagemen are picking up the garbage is a stitch. Here we have some looney lefto expounding about everyone's right to go through the garbage, and the other practical one stating how he hates cul-de-sacs because you can get trapped there, etc. The scene when the gas line blows up is hilarious.
