When I stepped out of the train station, my first reaction was WOW. Venice is a truly magical city and different from anywhere else in the world. People had told me that it smelled and was dirty, but I didn't find that at all (and I was there in the middle of the summer). The water taxis make getting around easy, but the best way to get around Venice is to walk. Just follow all of the different winding paths and see where they take you. If you are looking for a side trip, check out Murano, a local village where glass-blowing is king.
