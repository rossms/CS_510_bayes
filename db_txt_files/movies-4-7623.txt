This film is an excellent modernization of the Odyssey in film form. It is quite funny and very entertaining. George Clooney delivers an excellent character performance. One which I had thought him incapable of. Most of the allusions to the Odyssey are only metaphorical in nature meaning the movie can be enjoyed without one having any knowledge of Homer or his poetry. I laughed hard and came away entertained.
