The first Tony Hawk game was awesome, but this game is just inbelievable! With the addition of more pro skaters to chose from, you can design your own skaters, design your own skate parks, and customize your trick lists. There is a wider variety of tricks you can do, and the graphics are stunning. Also, the soundtrack is totally excellent...some of my favorite bands perfrom in it. Skaters and non-skaters alike can enjoy this game, even people who know nothing about skateboarding. Anyways, it's a really fun, untiring game that never gets old...really brilliantly done.
