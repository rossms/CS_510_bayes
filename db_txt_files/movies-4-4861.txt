A pretty good movie about a very intelligent adorable dog named Benji. The plot is kind of weak, a homeless dog makes friends with different people in a town. especially two children who end up getting kidnapped and Benji must now save the day He also makes friends with another dog that gets named Tiffany Of course Benji saves the kids and the grateful dad gives Benji and Tiffany a home. But if you are a dog lover the movie is worth watching to see this talented little dog { really named Higgins} steal every scene in the movie.
