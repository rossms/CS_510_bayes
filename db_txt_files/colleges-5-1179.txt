Ok obviously they are not all dumb kids who go to Yale. You cannot make a generalized statement like that and at every school there are kids who get in because of legacy who shouldn't have. By far the worse school with letting people in who deffinitly should not be accepted is Georgetown. I went to Yale last weekend for the first time and absolutely loved it. I am looking to transfer there and if anyone knows of what you need to get in as a transfer please let me know.
