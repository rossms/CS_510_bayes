This place is absolutely awesome. I went there for the first time two weeks ago, and was so impressed that we went again last night, ans both times it was excellent! My steak was cooked just right, and I just love the taste of their unique Mashed Potatoes. I also enjoy the Fried Mozzerella as an appetizer- simply awesome! The service is great and the restaurant is generally clean. A great place to go for a good meal!
