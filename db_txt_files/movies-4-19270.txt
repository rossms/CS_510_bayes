While not nearly as good as its predacessor, Halloween 2 has many fine points which makes it the best followup possible to the origional. Halloween 2 adopts the Friday the 13th traits of gore and added nudity, which when combined with the suspense makes for a great horror movie. Halloween 2 was very good- the setting, the acting, and the ending, which would have made a great closure to the series.
