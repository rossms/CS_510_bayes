A beautifully shot film. . .incredible scenery and above-average acting (except the kids). The story is basically a Greek tragedy set in a 1930's ganster-era. Like a Greek tragedy, the plot and characters are rather simple. (You know how it's going to end.) This is a movie based on style, visuals and performance. If that sounds good to you, then watch it. The director (Sam Mendes) also made American Beauty . . .this guy has a great future.
