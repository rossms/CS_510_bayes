I've always enjoyed this city every time I had the pleasure of visiting it. . .Nice people, great bars and restraunts. . .some of the most unique sports fans I've ever met. . .I wish I could spend more time there. Chicago is underrated because it's so easy to find your way around- the whole city is spread out on a grid so that even a first-time visitor would have to be blind to get lost.
