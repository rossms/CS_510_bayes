No culture. You got to be frickin nuts, or just plain ignorant. Minneapolis is one of the most cultured cities in the states. The highest number of Somali and Hmong refugess reside in the Twin Cities. Minneaplois is second to only New York in theatre and arts. The Twin Cities is home to a number of Fortune 500 companies that got their start in MN. MN has more golf courses than any state and more shoreline. I could go on. Things you out of towners probably had no clue about. That's good, though. Oh, the air is clean and we actually like to work in Minnesota.
