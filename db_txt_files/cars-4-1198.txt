Although I am not a fan of imports and would never buy any of them, I do rate them fairly on RIA. The TL is a luxury sport sedan. Pricing starts around $30k. Two V-6's are offered, one with 225hp, the other with 260hp. Other choices include Audi A4, Lexus ES300, and Infiniti I30. Overall, the TL is smart, reliable choice that blends luxury with sport.
