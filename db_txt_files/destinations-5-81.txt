Having been in Kobe, Kyoto was a lot more tourist oriented. Many more European faces.Fantastic place for souveniers and gifts! Shrines everywhere - a short study of Japanese religion could be very useful before a tour! Politeness, service presentation are artforms in Japan. It's as well to brush up on Japanese customs before you arrive (eg. blowing your nose in public, walking while eating or drinking and talking loudly are frowned on).
