The first Dumb and Dumber was a lot of fun so I watched this expecting to laugh. This sequel had the same style of humor but it wasn't nearly as funny. The storyline was better in the first one and what I realized is that Jim Carrey and Jeff Daniels really made that movie what it was. These new guys were younger and just weren't as good actors.
