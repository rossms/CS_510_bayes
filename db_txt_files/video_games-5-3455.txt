I enjoyed this game so much. So much, in fact, that few other games seemed worth my time after playing that one. I recently purchased Final Fantasy IX. What a let-down! Just because it is newer, doesn't mean it is better. Final Fantasy VIII has the best graphics of the series, except for maybe X. It has interesting game play and characters. I find myself starting a brand new game probably more than I should.
