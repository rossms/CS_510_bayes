I haven't heard anything about what will come after Apple Skoal, but Timber Wolf sure kicked UST in the face with their new Peach! bennettjosh2004 is right, there's a lot of people I know who are actually switching from Skoal to TW Peach. If UST is smart, we'll see Skoal Peach soon! BTW, UST is coming out with Revel which I understand is supposed to be like those Skoal Flavor Packs from the 90's. Anyone else heard anything?
