Middlebury College is truely a gem of a school! Top notch academics, first rate facilities, and a beautiful mountain location. The students are friendly. Highly recommended. As for Birch45's comments, just look at his or her other ratings for Amherst and Bates and you'll see that he/she is not being objective--then look at his/her ratings for Dickinsin and Wesleyan (where Birch45's son goes) and you may get a better sense of why he/she has chosen to disparage excellent schools...
