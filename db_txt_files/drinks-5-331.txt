In Canada we'd like to think we have the best beer in the world, but the truth is, you can't judge a whole country's brewing by one brand of beer, we have plenty of mass produced bad beers here, Sam Adams proves that the Americans indeed have good brewers, I'd rather have this than the mass produced canadian garbage any day.
