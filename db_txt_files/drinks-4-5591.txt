A good orange soda. It has more of a tang flavor then a real orange flavor (probably because of how sweet it is). I enjoy this one. Even though again Pepsi had to put Mt Dew logos all over their new softdrink to guarentee good sales. Even though orginal Mt Dew is sposed to taste like citrus and again you cant taste it in Livewire, Livewire remains the best Pepsi has brought out in years. (Remember Josta anyone?)
