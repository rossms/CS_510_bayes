cameron diaz took a big chance playing that uglycow and .... nobody noticed! this movie was intriguing and a great surprise but yuck, i hate john malkovich. he is such a pandering self-important *ss. his roles are always too conveniently positioned so he can get his rottenold dick into nice young pssy. what a jerk. cant stand him. lame actor.
