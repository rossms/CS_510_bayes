Small portable player/recorder uses miniature rewritable discs to store anything from your favorite mp3s to class lectures. You can listen to your tracks in your car with a car adapter, or put it in your pocket for a jog. I bought the MZR-50 a couple years ago and it is probably one of the best buys I've ever made.
