Bought a used 1991 version of one of these when I started renovating to haul crap to the dump and back from the Home Depot. Paid a couple of grand, beat it damn near to death and it still runs like a rather rugged charm. Ugly as a whisky soaked turd, but it keeps going, and that's all that matters to me.
