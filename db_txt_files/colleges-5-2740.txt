Humboldt is a great retreat behind the redwood curtain. It is a place that someone can find themselves and see and experience many unique people and events. Academics are challenging and the students are motivated and passionate. Very liberal and open minded...and not all hippies and stoners. The redwood forest and coast is absolutely breathtaking and there isn't a traffic light in town.
