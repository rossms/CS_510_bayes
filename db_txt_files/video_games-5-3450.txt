I started CD1 in 6 months ago I was very busy that time. I only finished 30 minutes of gameplay. I did'nt like the way it was going. So I stopped playing later after five months I came back just for fun. Then I realised The story had taken momentum. It was not just a game it was a movie. Action, comedy, drama, thriller, romance, tragedy, patriotism, and god knows better. I finished it again it took me 6 months but I still play it again. What a remarkable game. Infact it is the only FF series I have played and I want to play them all.
