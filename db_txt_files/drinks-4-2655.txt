In the market of gourmet coffees Hills Brothers probably doesn't stand a chance but I'm not a huge coffee snob so I'm not rating it in that category. I do however appreciate a decent cup of Joe, and was very surprised recently when I was having coffee at a friends house and saw the Hills Brothers can. It was actually pretty decent which really surprised me considering that I had this preconceived notion about coffee from a can as always being bad. I should also note that I tend to add an exceptional amount of both cream and sugar to my coffee, so it's tough to ever have a really bad cup.
