An above average thriller. It was a bit hard to get into at first, but after about the first twenty minutes or so of the film things began to pick up. Near flawless acting by everyone involved, especially Hawke. Overall, Taking Lives was suspenseful and kept me interested throughout most of the film, making it a solid thriller.
