The original T-Mac , Todd is not going to overwhelm you with athleticism. What he is going to do is catch the ball and put it in the basket. His large, soft, Canadian hands are able to catch the passes that Dikembe's could not, making him a solid low post option on a team that is suddenly stacked. While he is not the defensive presence that Dikembe was, he is anywhere from 12-18 years younger than Deke (depending on Mutombo's actual age). If you combine Big Mac's strengths with those of Sixer back-up center Samuel Dalembert, you have the ultimate weapon.
