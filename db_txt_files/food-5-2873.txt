These are little pieces of Heaven. However I must respond to 'Shroomwoman' and her rating. First, her NAME says a WHOLE lot, get my drift? See's are wonderful, but hey, they are NOT reasonably priced, the store DOES have fancy displays, the packaging IS fancy, and YEAH! they are friendly and generous with samples because DUH! they want you to BUY! I think 'Shroomwoman' ventured into a See's store WAY too soon after consuming some of her little 'Shroomy' friends :)
