hands down, the coolest campus i've ever set foot on. my girlfriend and I got a little lost while walking around but it was so pretty we really didn't care. But 2 oddities were apparent upon my first visit: 1)we were the only 2 people on campus traveling on foot, i.e. not riding bikes. (NB: it's possible that cyclists will mark you as intruders if you are on foot) 2) on-campus libraries must number in the teens.
