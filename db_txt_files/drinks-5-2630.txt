i've always enjoyed the occasional expensive cup of starbucks (white chocolate mocha3) but one day earlier this month, my friend took me to a gas station to get coffee, and i have found that gas stations have the best coffee, cappuchinos to be exact. they're reasonably priced, and they taste wonderful. i'm becoming addicted to BP's Irish Creme cappuchino, in fact, i have a craving for one right now...
