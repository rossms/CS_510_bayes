This movie is appropriate for all audiences, it is a strange and dull movie. The movie seems to be escapist, but the portryal of poor families shatters the escapism. Also, the acting is poor and the sets bland. Even worse, the sappy songs grate when compared to all of the great music that is out there. The movie could also use more humor.
