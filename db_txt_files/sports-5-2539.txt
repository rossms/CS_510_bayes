Modern day Baseball genius is correct. He's seeing the game in an all new way that is just now being imitated in GM's like Theo Epstien and Paul DePodesta at Toronto. It's a wonder more people dont emulate what he's done with a shoestring budget in Oakland. Read the book Moneyball for a more detail view of how Beane operates. He's yet to win it all, but with is approach he probably will. He may need to leave Oakland to do it though.
