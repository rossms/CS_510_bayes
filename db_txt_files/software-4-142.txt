I've used Quicken since 1990 and found it's very user friendly. However, tech/customer support is poor as their customer base has grown more rapidly than the company's ability to provide service. It works perfectly with Turbo Tax(also Intuit). Investment following is OK but not nearly the quality of morningstar.com or other similar web sites. It offers the best overall package of features. Bottom line-buy it!
