Definetly one of the most interesting countries in the world. Not only do you have a exciting fusion between an ancient celtic culture and the rest of the world in the cosmopolatin, but you also have an extremely intelligent, educated, funny, and witty population. Not to mention the beautiful scenery. One has not lived until they have sat down with their friends and raised glasses of guiness in a toast while sitting in a fine Irish pub.
