I haven't seen the video in so long that i cant even remember what happened in it, this means that it was really lovey dovey and i don't want to remember, even though I'm still a huge fan. Uh-oh guys this video was probably averge, but b/c i love the song and it's their only video on here i'll be kind and give it a four... Backstreet's back was so much better and by far their best video.
