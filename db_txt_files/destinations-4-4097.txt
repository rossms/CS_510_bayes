Want to try out a new persona for a weekend? Or just indulge in the many things for which Vegas is justly famous? Then knock your self out. For a few days I can be as hedonistic as the next guy. But I do not recommend moving there. Urban sprawl is worse in Vegas than most other places today, the people are seldom friendly and often very dysfunctional. It is easy to get caught in situations that threaten your well-being before you know you have been drawn in. But for the vacationing epicure, it has plenty to offer 24/7 and might be best appreciated on that basis.
