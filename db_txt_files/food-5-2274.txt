Twix is a truly scrumptious candy bar. I love the satisfying combination of crunchy cookie and smooth caramel, with a touch of chocolate. Somehow Twix doesn't seem quite as heavy as some other candy bars (although that's probably not the case!). When I buy Halloween candy, I always include at least one bag of Twix.
