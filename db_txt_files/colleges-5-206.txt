As someone who went to Brandeis University as an undergrad as well as a grad student, I can wholeheartedly say that the education at IBS closely matched that of the more prestigious undergraduate college. The courses, which are broken down by finance, economics, and business, allowed students to either concentrate on one specific area or be more of a generalist. Furthermore, the emphasis on all things international is extremely important in our increasingly globablized society.
