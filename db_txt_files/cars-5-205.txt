I have a 2003 Sportsman 600 carb model. I brought it back after they (the dealer) said there was a recall on the jets for ATV's bought in the northern states. This was done and they replaced a main drive shaft (clunking) even though I was past the replacment date. I just paid for labor. I have many hrs on mine as it's used daily on a farm for hauling etc. Runs great!!
