Rick Majerus operates under constraints that only one other college coach in the country does. Namely, that up to half (or more) of his players end up leaving the program for two years at a time for religious service. That would decimate almost any basketball program. But Majerus manages to put a team on the floor that almost every year has gone to the NCAA's, rarely missed a first round and consistently gone deep into the tournament, including missing the championship by a measley 11 points. That is nothing short of *phenomenal* coaching.
