I guess I'm not being original here, but he is pretty likable dude who doesn't seem to be too caught up in his success. Each time that he is on a talk show (I've heard him on Howard Stern and saw him on Kilborn recently), he appears to be genuinely excited by his success and doesn't take himself very seriously. And, while he seems to have played similar roles in all of his movies, apparently he will be in a drama in the next year or so.
