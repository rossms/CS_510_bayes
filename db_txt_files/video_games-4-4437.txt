This hasn't been as exciting as the first Age of Empires to me. It was so much fun in the first one to go through the different ages, and get new units, research stuff, etc, but Age of Empires II is just overwhelming. I like starting the games, but I don't usually finish. Plus, I'd rather be playing as Egyptians or Phoenicians than Huns, Byzantines, and all these new civilizations.
