James Stewart was a really good actor. Sure his image is that of the good midwestern aw shucks shy kind of guy, but Stewart was more than that image. He could pull off complicated, and challenging roles and yes play the good guys that we all love. Just watch him in It's a Wonderful Life, Vertigo, Rear Window, Mr Smith Goes to Washington and even The Philadelphia Story each movie is different, each character is different but these are just a sample of movies that will show Stewart's range.
