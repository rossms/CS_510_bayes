My husband bought one of these and he loved it. It was so reliable had it for 125,000 miles. He never did anything but change the oil and tires. And even that he wasn't great about doing. It never once broke down. He ended up totaling it on a deer, but he really misses it. He say's it was a lot of fun to drive.
