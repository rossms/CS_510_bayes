TO SHUKHEVICH AND THE OTHERS: ITALY WAS ADMITTED LIKE WINNER AT THE PEACE TABLE AFTER THE 1ST WORLD WAR! BEFORE SPEAKING STUDY HISTORY. ANYWAY HYSTORY IS NOT ONLY THE 2 WORLD WARS! THE ROMAN EMPIRE WAS ERECTED THANKS TO ITALIAN PEOPLE. IF YOU WANT I WILL QUOTE SOME ITALIAN CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE WOLRD CULTURE. IT IS TYPICAL AMERICAN CONSIDERING THE HISTORY OF THE WORLD EMPHASIZING THE MILITARY CONTRIBUTIONS. WHO CONTRIBUTED TO MAKE THE WORLD BETTER? GENGIS KHAN OR SHAKESPEARE? BONAPARTE (OF ITALIAN ORIGIN) OR MICHELANGELO?
