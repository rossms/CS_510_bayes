Great fans, very classy , knowledgeable, and gracious. Generally very successful: since the 20's, they've won more Series than any other N.L. club. I'm not sure how they'll do this coming season, as their offseason moves have been kinda strange. Storied club with some of baseball's greatest players over the years: Musial, Hornsby, Gibson, Dean, Ozzie Smith, Pujols, Frisch, Brock,etc.
