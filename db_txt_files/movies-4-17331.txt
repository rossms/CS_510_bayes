I liked this movie for the most part. A young woman does a good deed for someone she has never met.{she finds a box belonging to this person from his childhood} when she returns it anonymously and sees how happy it made him, she vows to do good deeds for others. On the opposite side when she observes a nasty man who is mean to his employee, she plays some good little tricks on him. this movie can be funny and has several charming scenes. and in the end she finds happiness for herself. this is a nice feel good movie. it does drag in parts and is a bit too long. This movie is in french. with captioning.
