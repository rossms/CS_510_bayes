Almost everyone I know loved Forrest Gump, but I thought it was too long, boring and just plain bad. The acting was OK, but I found that I really didn't care about Forrest or what happened to him. The plotlines with him meeting the Presidents (all of them) and creating trendy catchphrases annoyed me. At the end I could care less whether Jenny died and how Forrest was affected by it.
