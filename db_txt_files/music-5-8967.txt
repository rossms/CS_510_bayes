New found glory is great though some don't consider it punk it is in its own way i mean when elvis came out what did they consider him? Not rock that wasn't even around am i right? let me just say music is changing always has and always will! nothing glod can stay (nfg get that one right) that is what music is maybe NFG is a new wave of music maybe in 30 years they will have invented a new music type who knows? peace and love God bless
