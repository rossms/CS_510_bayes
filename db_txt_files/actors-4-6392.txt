Catch a rising star. he's got talent and is beginning to blossom into a big time actor. Was great in Saving Private Ryan and has gotten some nice roles from that just like Barry Pepper has. Plays the aeronautical engineer in the remake of Flight of the Phoenix....a great role for an up and coming actor. Expect to see more of him in the future. The kid is good.
