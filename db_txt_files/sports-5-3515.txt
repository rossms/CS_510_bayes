He actually got the 300 wins in a 12 or 13 year span. Mathewson is the best hurler of all-time. There is no definitive way to establish the greatest, but he has the numbers and circumstances to keep him at the top of the argument. Poor health from being gassed in the war hurt him greatly. 5th in ERA. 3rd in wins. Unlike Cy Young Walter Johnson, Mathewson is NOT in the top ten in losses or games started or innings pitched. He did what he did in less time then the other greats. 3rd in shutouts. Led the league in K's five times. Led league in ERA 5 times. Won 37 games in 1908.
