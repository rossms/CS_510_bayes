Who can forget Herman Edwards' role in the Miracle in the Meadowlands? As a defensive back, he was known as an extremely smart player, and was respected by his teammates. As an assistant coach, he has earned nothing but praise. I wish Herman the best as coach of the Jets, and dealing with the pressure of dealing with the NY media and fans, not to mention being the first Black head coach in New York.
