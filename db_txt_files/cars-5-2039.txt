I have a friend that just got his 2001 after ordering straight from factory. The wait was worth it. We have taken for a couple of spins and it is like driving a dream. Very nice car. I have had the privledge of driving an 84 for a couple of months years ago, but I think Chevy has out done itself w/ the C5. How can anyone call this a piece of American trash? Do I sense of a bit of jealousy?
