This was the best game i have ever played, even to today, 2004. It is so fun because the people you shoot do all this funny stuff and make weird noises. This game was so awesome that i was playing it too much and in a Force of Dramatic self-control, i smashed it up because i was spending wayyy to much time on it even though i had already beat it several times. AWESOME GAME AND I ALREADY REGRET BREAKING IT!!!!!
