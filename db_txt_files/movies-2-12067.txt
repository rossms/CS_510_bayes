I thought The Animal was quite bad to be honest. Unfunny, unclever, juvenille and stupid. I don't know why I even bothered with it. The acting was terrible, the script unforgivable, and I found the movie actually quite embarrasing. Forget that and there's a good story. And that's it. Rob Scheider's girlfriend in it (I think she was in survivor), was a cardboard cut-out, while Rob Scheider's character was like that too. Good twist though. Summary: AN UNFUNNY, UNCLEVER, AND JUVENILLE FILM.
