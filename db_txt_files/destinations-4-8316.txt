Knott's is a great place for everyone...I've been going here as a kid since I was three and have always loved the place. I finally made a trip back as an adult (not since Holiday Haunt in 1996 had I been, and 1987 to the park in the daytime) and was pleased to test out all the newer rides and attractions I'd missed. This is still one of the best bargain attractions around and I still love the place even if it could sometimes use a little touch-up paint here or there. FYI, the holiday festivities are also nice and Snoopy on ice and Mrs. Knott's Chicken dinner were both worth the wait!
