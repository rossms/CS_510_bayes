Yum Yumm Yummy! in my tummy! I love a nice big choclatey kit-kat when I want a candy bar! nothin but kit-kats for me! I love the smooth texture of the outside and the wafery good center, and they are very sweet and very sugary and is a good hyper candy bar! I love eating kit-kats on trips and stuff. I also love the kinda crunchyness that adds to the overall texture!!
