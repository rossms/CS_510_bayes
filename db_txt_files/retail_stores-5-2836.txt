MY HUSBAND SURPRISED ME WITH MY ENGAGEMENT RING WHEN WE LIVED IN NY, HE THEN PURCHASED A RING GUARD. A DIAMOND FELL OUT WE WENT BACK THEY DIDN'T HAVE THE SAME GUARD BUT THEY REPLACED MY GUARD WITH A NEW ONE. WE HAVE BEEN HAPPY WITH WHITEHALL. I JUST FIND IT INTERESTING THEY DON'T HAVE A WEB ADDRESS TO WRITE TO. IS THERE A REASON THEY DON'T PUBLISH IT? I HAVE A QUESTION AND DON'T KNOW WHERE TO WRITE.
