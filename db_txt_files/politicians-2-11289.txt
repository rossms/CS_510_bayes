I don't doubt his sincerity, but he was grossly ineffective as a Senator. He failed to get any major pieces of legislation passed, and most of the bills that he took credit for were actually initiated and sponsored by others- he merely supported or attached his name to them. Too bad he couldn't stick around for another term- more experience and a better record in the US Senate would have greatly aided his presidential ambitions.
