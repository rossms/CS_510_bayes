I've been to hundreds of games at The Garden. I think Ewing is the greatest player in franchise history and the best jump-shooting center in league history. He owns lots of Knicks records for a 15-year career. He may not have won a title, but night-in and night-out he gave it his all and never made excuses. His work ethic was phenomenal. Every time he stepped to the foul line, about 2 or 3 ballboys had to mop up his sweat off the floor. That said a lot about his dedication to the game. He and I even chatted a few times. He told me that he saw me a lot at the games. Great guy.
