I agree with Shafty--this city needs a serious shot of Viagra. Nothing to recommend it--no good universities to speak of, no state capital, no up-and-coming industry at all. It's an Atlanta wannabe. Only saving grace is that the banks based here create a lot of capital for the Southeast and, in fact, the entire nation.
