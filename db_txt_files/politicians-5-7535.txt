Abraham Lincoln has got to be the greatest American president. He lead this country in the most terrible war it had experienced. It took him a while but he managed to emancipate the slaves-first in the states that had left the union then all slaves. Who knows what he would have done had he not been assasinated. I think the country wouldn't have taken so long to end segregation and other oppressions the whites put on them after the war and into at least the 60's.
