New York City is a good place to spend any break. The night life is awesome, and you can entertain yourself during the day at tourist attractions like the Statue of Liberty or NYSE. There's also tons of museums. The only problem is that it can still be really cold, even in March. It definitely isn't the place to get a tan.
