President Clinton is only a man. How the citizens of the United States can expect more from him than they expect from members of their own family is a mystery to me. He is an excellent leader; charismatic, influential, and intelligent. He embodies all that a president should be. Whether or not people of agree with his personal life is irrelevant. The man led our country through eight very prosperous years, to deny this truth is to lie to yourself. In hsitory, regardless of what the textbooks say, I will always remember him as a catalyst of peace and prosperity. And that is what I will teach my children.
