There are a lot of funny parts in this movie, but nothing worth paying full price to see. Orlando Jones is absolutely hysterical in almost anything he does, but I don't think his comedic abilities were used the way they should've been in Double Take. The plot is terribly scattered, and has many many pointless twists, that seem to be intended to keep the audience in suspense, but those pointless twists just make it annoying. Hardly a great comedy, but still 100 times better than Little Nicky.
