This is true, bear with me. You know, at airports, certain minorities dominate the workforce inside. At LAX and Miami, the Hispanics make up the majority of workers. At Detroit and New Orleans airport, blacks make up the majority of workers. Only at the San Fran airport did I find the majority of workers were Asian. Odd, but fun fact.
