They made some improvements on their fries, but the burgers are still nasty. The burgers would be great if you like still tasting them six hours later. I don't know what town Emmanuel Lewis was in when he said flame broiling beat frying, but I bet the burgers weren't flame broiled at Burger King. Not to mention, they have some pretty screwed up commercials.
