Oklahome is a different type of state. We were going there from Texas, and we're there all alone, in this small town there. It was very intimate and beautiful, but I also felt like I was in the twilight zone. There were a few cows, and a few tiny little restaurants, but that was it. There were fields and fields of beautiful flowers and it smelled good there too.
