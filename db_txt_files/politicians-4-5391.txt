As a teacher I can see what a mess the republicans made of the TESTING of our schools Do you really think that the private school will ACCEPT these voucher children? In order to teach ALL these children to learn I would have to take some of them home with me for the entire school year. Gore has a more realistic approach for sure and the teachers agree with him.
