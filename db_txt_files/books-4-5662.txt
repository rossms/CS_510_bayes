I agree that the ending was a little contrived, but the story reads fast and it is a fun book. It is a quick read, rather than anything that is going to make you think. The characters were a little bit too stereotyped for my taste, but the story held together really well until the end. I especially liked the dissection of Atlanta's cultural landscape.
