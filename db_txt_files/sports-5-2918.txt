The Babe may have lost a lot of his records in recent history, but he's still the greatest lifetime slugger to ever play the game. ie.-Ted Williams is arguably the greatest hitter baseball has ever produced. However, his lifetime slugging% of .634 finishes 8.1% below the Babe's .690!!! Now, that's a record that'll never be broken!
