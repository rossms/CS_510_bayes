What can you say about the Yankees? As a fan of baseball foremost (as opposed to a particular team), they're clearly the best of all time, the best this year, and quite possibly the team of the decade. Anything less than 5 stars for the franchise with the most team championships in ALL of professional sports reflects good old fashioned team prejudice. Which you're entitled to, of course- you're just wrong.
