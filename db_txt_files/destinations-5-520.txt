Went for a long weekend to Montego Bay. We went orignally booked to stay at Breezes - Montego Bay. The resort was horrible. The reservation for our ocean view room got messed up by our travel agent. So we got stuck in a cabin room next to the disco (until 4:00 am) and the recycle center (starts at 6:00 am). Needless to say we had checked out by 7:00 am and moved to Sunset Beach Resort in Montego Bay. It was great in every way. DO NOT STAY AT BREEZES - BAD ALL THE WAY AROUND.
