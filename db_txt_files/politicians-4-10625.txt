One of the most contradictory and tragic figures of U.S. history. Still, there was a lot accomplished by Nixon's time in the White House. One of the great foreign policy presidents in our history. He is credited for the opening with China which provided leverage against the U.S.S.R., averting nuclear war in the Mid-East in 1973, and ending a war which should have been ended in his predessor's term. These are just a few of Nixon's accomplishments.
