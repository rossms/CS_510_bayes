Greatest book out right now. Scholarly piece of work, by a genuine, intelligent man, Jeffrey Sachs. Few peers, or academic scholars would say anything negative about this soon to be classic. Anyone who cares not only for others--as taught by any religion--but for your own safety and well-being, should read it now.
