he is a great president. He is a true american. I am glad we have him in the White house. He handles tough situations well. We need a man like this to show us the right path in this country. He shows us all that he is as good as his dad. He made smart decisions after september 11 and he mad smart decisions about going into the war with iraq. I respect this man and i would be willing to fight for this country if ever he asked. I am proud to be an american. And i am proud to have a president like george w. bush. God bless america.
