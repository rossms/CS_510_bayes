When I was a teenager, I once solved this colored dot puzzle thing one evening at the house of some people I baby sat for. But when the Rubiks Cube craze came along, I knew there was no way I was ever going to solve this one. The one at our house belonged to my sister and after it sat around unsolved for a couple of years I decided to take all the squares off and put them all back as though I had solved it. For some reason, she really never saw the humor in that.
