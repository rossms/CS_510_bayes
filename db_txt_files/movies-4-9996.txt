Well done remake. Even a bit better than the original. Jamie Lee Curtis was great as the mom , and Lindsay Lohan was good as the daughter. both handled the reverse parts well without overdoing it. My daughter and I both enjoyed the movie. I usually avoid remakes since most are not as good as the original. This one was good.
