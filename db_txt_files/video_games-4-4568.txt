This game is great! It has a very interesting storyline, and it's pretty humourous too. You can choose from a diversity of socialist leaders. Amazing graphics too!The only bad thing about it would be that the game and citizen complaints just get old very easily and very soon. After that, it's like you're playing the same game over and over...
