The best team in major league baseball, oddly enough, because of the bats. Over the years, hitting was not their thing, relying on Maddux, Galvine, and Smoltz to pitch well enough for them. But with Maddux having a subpar year (10-8, ERA over 4) and Hampton doing only decent, and Ortiz is okay, their bats are the focal point of their success. Maybe this turn of strategy is thier key to winning the World Series, because they couldn't do it with pitching.
