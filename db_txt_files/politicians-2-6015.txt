His ranting and raving at the Ashcroft confirmation proceedings seemed out-of-control, mean-spirited and childish. It was horrifying to watch this man, who left a young girl to die, try to destroy the character and credibility of a man of such integrity and honor. He has turned into a parody....what a failed human being; what a joke
