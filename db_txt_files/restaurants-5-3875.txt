This is a great concept. Call ahead, pick it up after work and throw it in the overn when yu get home. it's half the price of any of the other chains, it's not cold when you get home, and you don't have to wait forever for a '75 Vega to inch down your street looking for the house with all the lights on and the front porch light flashing.
