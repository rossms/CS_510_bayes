Let's say you're a call girl. Ok, but let's say you're a call girl anyway. So. You want to impress your trick as someone worldly and experienced, but you're still at heart a 'rita drinker. What you'd want to order is one of these with Gran Marnier. It's a very good, 100% agave. It has a price to match. That is to say, it's a bit overpriced, but if it's good enough, why count pennies, honey? Me love you long time. Until the next morning when you wake up ashamed, of course. But that's tequila for you, innit mate?
