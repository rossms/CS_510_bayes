Quite frankly Sarasota is a big waste of time and money. The beaches are much, much nicer along the northern Gulf of Mexico, especially in the area of Gulf Shores, Alabama to Destin, Florida. Sarasota is overcrowded, overpriced, and overaged. I know what I'm talking about since in the last 20 years I have probably made 60 trips there. I'll take the beach at Gulf Shores or Navarre Beach near Destin anytime!
