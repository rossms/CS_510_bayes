I absolutely love Chex Mix. I like the Kid's triple cheese as well as the spicy flavor the best as well as the kid's pizza. I've just bought the Honey nut and Cocoa mix but have yet to try them. The melba toast in the spicy version is the best thing and the wheat chex pieces are really good as well. Chex Mix in general comes in so many varieties that it is always interesting and a lot healthier than potato chips
