One of the nicer islands in the Caribbean. The Atlantic side of the island has great beaches for surfing and a rugged coastline. The western Caribbean side has less waves and is much flatter. Bridgetown itself is nothing special. Get out into the countryside; there's lots of great scenery there. Visit the cave in the middle of the island, very interesting. Overall, a decent vacation destination.
