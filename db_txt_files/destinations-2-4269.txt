One of the more pleasant and welcoming cities in the American South, though not terribly much to do. Rather humid, though Gulf currents make the weather a bit more bearable than comparable towns. Still a distressing amount of racism and general-purpose bigotry, and not a high value placed on education or opportunity. Generally courteous and hospitable folk, conditional for some on your color, dialect, or other such features.
