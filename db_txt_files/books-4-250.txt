Anorexia is a terrible terible disease. This opened my eyes to the horror of what can happen. Imagine your body destroying itself. You lose your electrolytes and when you lie in bed, You lie on your bones. You have no fat left in your body to keep you warm. This shows the tragic reality of anorexia and the dire consequences.
