Rented in summer 2005 from Maui's airport, online, with a discount code. Had the car for 10 days, so the rate was high, but good compared to other companies. The car was older, but in decent condition. No roaches as I have read by other renters in Hawaii. Car drove to Haleakela, so it did well. No complaints. Slow, but everything in HI is!! Would rent from them again. The Maui aiport rental requires a shuttle, but it's not too bad.
