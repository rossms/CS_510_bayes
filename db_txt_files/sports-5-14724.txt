In my opinion, he was the best quarterback ever. Marino and Montana would have been injured and sidelined in the first season had he played behind the offensive line that John did. He never played for himself, always for the team and for the Denver fans. He gave up part of his salary to get a good running back like Davis that eventually helped them to win 2 Super Bowls. Now that he's gone, I appreciate him even more.
