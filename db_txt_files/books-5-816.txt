not really an original story (British Schoolboy stories are pretty common) but i love the twist rowling uses in this series. The magical world is written well enough to make children believe that it could be possible. And haarry is a relatable character for most kids: he's small, powerless (in the beginning), not well off, bullied and alone. all children feel like that at some point, and they can relate with that character. This book is a great intro to the series and a great book in and of itself. It teaches kids the power of friendship and trust, and also about humility and hard work.
