I really enjoyed Top Gun. It's filled with lots of handsome, highly masculine, daredevil-type men, and they're either flying fancy planes or playing volleyball without shirts. It's all very entertaining. The plot is fairly interesting, and there are some exciting, tense scenes. The soundtrack adds quite a bit to the movie experience, too. Then you have Tom Cruise at his finest. Need I say more?
