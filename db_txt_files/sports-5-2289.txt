This was a tough World Series. Even though i LOVE my Yankees, the Marlins put up quit a fight. The Marlins are a great team that made it all the way with young guys, new GM, and earned 2 World Series titles. For me too, it WAS hard watching the Marlins celebrating in Yankee Stadium on OUR field. Yankees are still number one in my heart and always will be. Truthfully, i was rootin for the Marlins on the NL side during the playoffs shhh... but Yankees all the way during the World Series.. i cant believe im saying this but...congrats Marlins...congrats
