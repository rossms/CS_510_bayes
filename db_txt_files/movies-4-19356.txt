I thought this was a pretty worthy movie but the first one is still the best out of the series.I thought the ending was too goofy and the killers were pretty much surprising because we never got to know them in the movie which made the movie a bit stupid.Other than that and the goofy deaths(Cici died :( ) this movie is good.
