A spoiled rotten scion of the miserable Hanoverian Dynasty. Neither of his parents was the brightest bulb on the planet, so we can hope for future peccadilloes, I'm sure. I always am amazed at the star worshipers who follow the "exploits" of this rather unattractive and unremarkable family. We are lucky that our Constitution guarantees a republican form of government. The crypto-royalishts would bring back the king if they had half the chance.
