One of the seven wonders of the natural world and located on the Zambezi River along the border between Zambia and Zimbabwe, Victoria Falls drops over a cliff into a 100 meter (328 foot) deep crevice between the river and a matching cliff. The first European to discover the falls was David Livingstone in 1855, who named the awesome spectacle Victoria after the British queen. The spray from Victoria Falls towers around one thousand feet over the Zambezi plain. The native Africans called the falls Mosi oa Tunya (The Smoke that Thunders).
