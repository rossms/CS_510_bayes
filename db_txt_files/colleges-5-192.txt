This school is fantastic - strategically located in the capital of Latin America with strong ties to hundreds of major corporation. Thnaks to UM I enjoyed an internship overseas (Chile) and now travel weekly for a Fortune 500 around the globe. Also, the campus is beautiful and the student body is international and exotic.
