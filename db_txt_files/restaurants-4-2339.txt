Long John Silver's was never meant to be as fancy as Red Lobster or something of that nature. Of course it is going to be greasy, as it is fast food. What do you expect for those lower prices? And most of them have the baked fish option anyways, for the health food fanatics. Their chicken strips are known to be some of the best in the world, as well as their fish strips. And I don't know any tarter sauce that can beat theirs. It is awesome.
