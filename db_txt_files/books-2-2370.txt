The art gets sloppier all the time, and the attempts at relevance--Chip Gizmo? PLEASE! They had an international contest, ended up combining the names of 2 DISNEY CHARACTERS?!? Anyhow, the attempts at relevance are lame as well as late. The strip is out of date and out of touch, and I think it's time for the factory to shut down. Have you ever felt, well, you know--not so fresh?
