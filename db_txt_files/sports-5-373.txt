Too bad that there is only a five-star scale. I would gladly give this guy a four point nine score, if only because the only pitchers in my short lifetime to have earned a five-star rating have been Randy Johnson and Greg Maddux. Roger Clemens is almost in their league, but not quite. Oh well, I will still tell my grandkids about this guy, so who cares if he is a tenth of a star below the creme de la creme? Good guy, even though he used to play for the Blue Jays, who will rot in hell for eternity. (I am Canadian who hates Toronto, so sue me).
