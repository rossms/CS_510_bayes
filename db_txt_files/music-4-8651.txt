A mediocre song by Nirvana standards but a music video I really enjoy. The song is not one of their best but it is still a good song, none the less. I like the music video, it contains a bunch of unreleased clips of Kurt and Nirvana show for about 3 seconds a peice, the whole thing in less than average quality shown on an old TV shaped screen. I think it all creates a nice effect and does what it was supposed to. The video ends with Kurt in the air in freezeframe and the TV shuts of, it is very symbolic of Kurt's life burning out. Good video, average song.
