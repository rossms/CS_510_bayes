This book, while not terrible, was just not interesting, intelligently written, or really worth reading. Although it is infamous for the swearing it contains (a big draw to many students), the language does not contribute to the work because it becomes simiply redundant. Actually, rather than leaving me with a fuller understanding of myself, the author, a time period, people in general, or any of the other items a book should enlighten one about, this book left me simply depressed and sorry for having spent my energy reading it.
