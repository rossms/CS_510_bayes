This guy promises to be a tumour for the environment in the state of the Wyoming. Mercury Poisoning,blankets of soot, that's stuff you'd usually see out East. Dave's gonna bring it to Wyoming too. If he were on the other end of the scale on the environment, I'd definitely vote for him next time around.
