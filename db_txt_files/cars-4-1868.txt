I currently own a 2001 Dodge Stratus SE, purchased new and loaded. The 2.7 Liter V6 is responsive and the ride is excellent, considering the price. On the quality front, in the 40,000 miles I have owned it, it has only required routine maintenance and the replacement of a fog light. It has proved itself to be an excellent value for the money, and is a purchase I have never regretted making. The only negatives I can think of is the use of cheap-feeling plastics in the interior, especially in the center console.
