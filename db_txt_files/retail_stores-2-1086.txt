I've never been that fired up by their stuff and to be honest didn't even realize that they were still around! I don't think I've either been in or seen one of their stores in probably 8 years. I seem to remember them having quite a foothold at one time but apparently they've become victims of the squeeeeeezzzzzzzee.
