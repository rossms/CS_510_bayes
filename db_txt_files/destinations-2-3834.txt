The local population is way too obsessed with Buckeye football. A local newscast actually had as a lead story of 'when the Buckeyes team plane would land at Port Columbus International Airport'. This was after the 2004 Alamo Bowl against Oklahoma State--hardly a major bowl game. There is little to do here except visit the mall and obsess about 20 year olds playing college football. There are some nice, cheap golf courses farther away from town in the rural areas. The economy here used to be excellent for white collar college graduates, but it's not as good as it used to be.
