Okay people...these are some good cigarettes. If you are broke and have to go generic forget the basics, GPC's, and Rogers, because Dorals DO NOT taste generic. In fact they taste better than a lot of premium brands now that the blend has changed. I smoke Marlboro Lights 100's, but anytime I am broke and can't get Marlboro Lights 100's I do not mind at all to smoke the Doral Light 100's. The FF, menthol, and menthol lights are all good. I have never tried the ultra lights. Try these...you will be suprised! The best generic cigs on the market!!!
