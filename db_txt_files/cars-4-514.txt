This rating is for a 2001 FXDX Dyna Super Glide Sport. It's my first Harley and I'm very impressed with the quality. Feels very solid and well engineered. Pretty heavy bike for a sport bike (630 lbs) though. So I keep my Buell S3 for the fast fun riding throught the turns. But this FXDX satisifes my need for a Harley quite well.
