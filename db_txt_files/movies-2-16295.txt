Interesting. Some people seem to think this movie was a documentary. The fact is, critically speaking, the movie is just a badly done, two-hour anti-Semitic snuff film with dialogue and caricatures that even Cinemax would be ashamed to show at 2am. I can't wait for the sequel, The Christ Strikes Back.
