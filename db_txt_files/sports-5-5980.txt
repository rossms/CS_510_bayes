The opposite of love is disinterest. If JJ wasn't any good, noone would be talking about him. He's not a great athlete, by any means, not like mccants, not like felton, not like dee brown. But by god the kid can shoot. He can shoot because he works at it. He practices. If McCants tried half as hard as JJ, who knows how good he could be, the man's a freak athlete. But until then, JJ's going to continue to be the leading scorer in the ACC, with half the god given athletic abilities that the rest of the players in the conference have.
