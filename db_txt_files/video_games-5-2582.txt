I recently purchased this game before buying a memory card. Big mistake. I soon solved this problem, and after playing with the card I became totally engrossed in this interactive 3rd-person RPG (after the first little bit). It took me about 1 1/2 weeks to finish, and that was non-stop. I seriously slept clutching my Dreamcast controller.
