I just purchaced a 1995 XE. I traded a GMC 4x4 for it. It rides great, and enjoys predictable handling in the snow and ice. It is amazing that people buy domestic vehicles when better money spent is in the import market. My GM could barely defrost the windows and this Pathfinder makes enough heat to melt steel. Driver ergonomics is excellent, seating is comfortable, and it seems powerful enough, but a little thirsty at the pump. I would definately recommend this vehicle.
